For instance, in the output, the middle part of the grid has been updated to include `4`s where there were previously `3`s, suggesting an increment based on proximity.\n   - **Example 2**: Similar behavior is observed where `3`s are turned into `4`s in specific locations, especially where there are clusters of `3`s.\n   - **Example 3**: Following the same pattern, clusters of `3`s turn into `4`s based on adjacency.\n   - **Example 4**: The transformation continues to show clusters of `3`s changing to `4`s, particularly at intersections or dense areas.\n   - **Example 5**: This large grid follows the same pattern, indicating that the transformation rule is consistent across various sizes of grids.\n\n2. **Identifying the Rule**: \n   The rule seems to involve incrementing:\n   - If a cell contains `3` and has adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically) that also contain `3`, the `3` may become a `4`. \n   - Cells that are `0` remain `0`, and `3`s that aren't near other `3`s do not change.\n\n3. **Applying the Rule to Test Input**:\n   For the test input grid, I will analyze each cell and determine if it should be incremented based on the presence of adjacent `3`s:\n   - I will check each `3` in the grid and see if it has neighbors that are also `3`.\n   - If it does, that `3` will become `4`. \n\nGiven the test input grid:\n``` \n00000000000000000000\n00300000000000000000\n03033000000000000000\n00303333303300000000\n00003000030030000000\n00003333303330000000\n00000000000003333300\n00000000000003000300\n00000000000003000300\n00000000033333000300\n00000000030003000300\n00000000333333000300\n00000033030003333300\n00300000330000000000\n03030000000000000000\n00303033333300000000\n00000003000300000000\n00000003000300000000\n00000003333300000000\n00000000000000000000\n```\nI will perform the transformation based on the identified rule.\n\nAfter carefully checking each `3`, I will update them according to the rule, leading to the following output grid:\n\n<answer>\n[\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 3, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n</answer>", 1116, 1757]}

The 2 appears in the second row, specifically at the second column.\n\n2. **Example 2:**\n   - Input:\n     ```\n     1105010\n     0015111\n     1105010\n     ```\n   - Output:\n     ```\n     020\n     002\n     020\n     ```\n   - Here, the output also has a 3x3 grid.

The positions where the 2s appear seem to be influenced by the arrangement of the input grid values.\n\nNow applying this deduction to the test input:\n- Test Input:\n  ```\n  1015101\n  0105101\n  1015010\n  ```\n- Analyzing the grid, we can see that the value '5' is present in several places. According to the previous patterns, wherever we find a '5', we may replace it with a '2' in the output. The surrounding '1's and '0's would likely translate to '0's in the output grid.\n\nBy examining the input, I will focus on positions of '5's and determine where the '2's should replace them in the output grid. The positions of '5's in the test grid suggest that '2's will be placed at positions corresponding to where '5's appear in the input grid.\n\nThe expected output grid is:\n- The first row will have 0s,\n- The second row will have a '2' at the second column (to correspond with the '5'),\n- The third row will have a '2' at the second column as well.\n\nThus, the predicted output will be:\n```\n000\n020\n002\n```\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2]]\n</answer>", 346, 669]}

Notably, the 2's in the input grid become 2's in a larger pattern in the output grid, indicating a potential grouping or duplication.\n   - In Example 2, we observe that the 1's and 2's maintain their positions but transform into larger patterns, such as turning into pairs or groups of numbers.\n   - In Example 3, we see a similar pattern where certain numbers group together and transform into larger patterns in the output.\n\n2. **Common Observations:**\n   - It appears that 0's remain 0's, and when a number like 2 or 3 appears, they are transformed into groups of the same number extending across rows or columns.\n   - Specifically, numbers are often duplicated side by side, and this appears to be consistent across examples.\n\n3. **Applying to Test Input:**\n   - The test input grid has a similar structure, and we can predict how the transformation will take place.\n   - For example, where we see the number '8' in the test input, we should expect it to create a pattern similar to the transformation of '2' in previous examples. \n   - The number '2' appears and is transformed into a pattern that extends the same way as seen in the previous examples.\n\n4. **Predicted Output Generation:**\n   - Based on the established patterns, I will work through the test input grid and apply the transformation rule.\n   - Each number will be analyzed to see if it should be extended or duplicated based on previous examples.\n\nAfter analyzing the test grid, we arrive at the following predicted output:\n\n- The rows with '884' will have the '8' transformed similarly to previous examples.\n- The '2's in the grid will be transformed into '2's that form larger blocks, similar to how they were transformed in previous examples.\n\nThus, after applying the transformation rule consistently across the test input, the final predicted output grid is:\n\n[[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4], \n [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4], \n [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]\n\n</answer>", 1688, 1989]}
