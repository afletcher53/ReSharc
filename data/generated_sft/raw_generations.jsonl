Let's check the pattern more carefully.\n\nIn Example 1, row 2:\n0500550660 \u2192 0588550000\n- The two 8's are moved to the rightmost zeros, and the rest is zeroed.\n\nIn Example 3, row 2:\n0000555005 \u2192 0000555885\n- The two 8's are moved to the rightmost zeros.\n\nSo, the pattern is:\n- Find the rightmost nonzero block in the row (the block of nonzero digits at the end).\n- Shift this block to the rightmost zeros in the row, and zero out their original positions.\n\nBut in the test input, there are no 8's. Let's check the other rows.\n\nAlternatively, is the block to be shifted the block that is not at the end? Let's check Example 2, row 2:\n5550509999 \u2192 5553500000\n- The 3 is moved to the rightmost zero.\n\nSo, the logic is:\n- For each row, find the nonzero digits that are not at the end, and move them to the rightmost zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the logic is:\n- For each row, find the block of nonzero digits that is not at the end, and move them to the rightmost zeros, zeroing out their original positions.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's try to apply the logic from the examples to the test input row by row.\n\nLet's try to match the pattern more precisely.\n\nLet's process row 0:\n0055555002\n\nPositions: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\nValues:    0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 2\n\nIn the examples, the block to be moved is the block that is not at the end, and is surrounded by zeros.\n\nSo, block 5 5 5 5 5 at positions 2-6.\n\nThe rightmost zeros are at positions 7 and 8.\n\nBut the block is length 5, and there are only 2 zeros at the end.\n\nIn the examples, if the block is longer than the zeros at the end, only as many as fit are moved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the block is moved to the rightmost zeros, and the rest is zeroed.\n\nSo, let's move the block 5 5 5 5 5 to positions 5-9, zeroing out positions 2-6.\n\nBut then, positions 0-4 are zeros.\n\nSo, the output would be:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5\n\nBut in the examples, the block is always of length 2 or 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the block is split, and only as many as fit are moved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the block is moved to the rightmost zeros, and the rest is zeroed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the block is moved

In the test input, look for such numbers and see if a similar extension or mirroring is possible.\n4. For example, in row 1, col 12-14: 373, in output, this will likely become 373 mirrored below or extended.\n5. For 8000 in row 2, col 9, in the output, this may become 8000 mirrored or extended.\n6. For 242 in row 8, col 15-17, in the output, this may become 242 mirrored or extended.\n7. For 700 in row 10, col 7, in the output, this may become 700 mirrored or extended.\n8. For 4000 in row 3, col 4, in the output, this may become 4000 mirrored or extended.\n9. For 303 in row 6, col 7, in the output, this may become 303 mirrored or extended.\n10. For 202 in row 15, col 11-13, in the output, this may become 202 mirrored or extended.\n11. For 4000 in row 16, col 5, in the output, this may become 4000 mirrored or extended.\n12. For 2000 in row 16, col 10, in the output, this may become 2000 mirrored or extended.\n13. For 10 in row 15, col 17, in the output, this may become 10 mirrored or extended.\n14. For 80 in row 16, col 17, in the output, this may become 80 mirrored or extended.\n15. For 10 in row 17, col 17, in the output, this may become 10 mirrored or extended.\n\nFrom the above, the pattern is: when a \"block\" of nonzero digits appears, copy it downward by a certain offset, or extend it to form a bar or square, or mirror it.\n\nLooking at the examples, the offset is usually +2 rows below for vertical mirroring, and for horizontal, it's sometimes +2 columns.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input.\n\n- Row 1, col 12-14: 373 \u2192 add 373 at row 3, col 12-14.\n- Row 2, col 9: 8 \u2192 add 8 at row 4, col 9.\n- Row 3, col 4: 4 \u2192 add 4 at row 5, col 4.\n- Row 6, col 7-9: 303 \u2192 add 303 at row 8, col 7-9.\n- Row 8, col 15-17: 242 \u2192 add 242 at row 10, col 15-17.\n- Row 10, col 7: 7 \u2192 add 7 at row 12, col 7.\n- Row 15, col 11-13: 202 \u2192 add 202 at row 17, col 11-13.\n- Row 15, col 17: 10 \u2192 add 10 at row 17, col 17.\n- Row 16, col 5: 4 \u2192 add 4 at row 18, col 5.\n- Row 16, col 10: 2 \u2192 add 2 at row 18, col 10.\n- Row 16, col 17: 8 \u2192 add 8 at row 18, col 17.\n- Row 17, col 17: 1 \u2192 add 1 at row 19, col 17.\n\nBut the grid is only 19 rows, so for those that would go out of bounds, skip.\n\n</thinking>\n<answer>\n[\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,7,3,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,2,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,8,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0],\n[0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0],\n[0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]\n]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 847, "completion_tokens": 1644}
