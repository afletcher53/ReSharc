Specifically, in each transformation, once a non-zero element is found, it replaces zeros in several neighboring cells, usually filling out evenly in both directions until a larger pattern is formed.\n4.

I analyzed the three given input-output examples to discern the transformation rule. In each example, certain segments filled with a specific number are shifted left, up, or both. This suggests a pattern where certain areas within rectangles are adjusted based on their surrounding context.\n2. Specifically, non-border-focused areas with different numbers are condensed by removing the first column of numbers that has been displaced horizontally, leaving behind the contextual border numbers. This \"shift\" pattern is repeated for different areas of interest.\n3.

The input grids show a number of structures consisting of numbers at the top row followed by a row of 5's across the entire width of the grid, and one or more additional isolated non-zero numbers scattered elsewhere.\n2. The first apparent transformation is in the top row where a zero is replaced by a 5 if a non-zero number follows it.\n3. Thus, the primary transformation is a \"filling process\" from the fixed row of 5's: for each non-zero number that is not isolated, an area in the bottom must mirror and expand this shape with its perimeter numbers being one more than the innermost numbers or the same innermost number.\n4.

Upon inspecting all examples, the significant transformation seems to involve filling regions with the digit '2' in a specific pattern.\n2. In each example, '2' is used to form rectangular shapes or extend existing rows and columns of special numbers, like '1', '3', or, in the case of the vertical expansion, '2' itself.\n3. From example 1, it appears that '2' helps \"frame\" blocks of '1' or '3'. In the horizontal direction, it was added along rows surrounding bands of '1' or '3'.\n4.

Analyze the pattern of transformation in each example. The outputs appear to be enlarged versions of the inputs.\n2. Each row of each input grid seems to be repeated with the resulting grid's row being a multiple of the input's size.\n3. Similarly, each column's entries are repeated in sequence, effectively multiplying the number of rows in the output as well.\n4.

Implement the strategy on the test input, observing the common features and constructing the 2x2 subgrid based on the frequency or specific pattern of number '2' in strategic sections (near bottom rows typically).\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[2, 2], [2, 2]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 1621, "completion_tokens": 217, "custom_id": "task_8597cfd7_req_20e2769a-78cc-46c4-9956-b51882fce416", "batch_id": "batch_6825d618692c8190a21aeb84bdca18f5"}

Apply transformation rule to the test input: Begin from points with color `2` and determine possible paths for extension without going through other colors (only use background space, typically `0`).\n5.

Apply inferred rules to the test grid ensuring '2' in test leads to adjacent '5's being converted to either '7' or '4'.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5], [0, 7, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 2, 7, 5, 5, 0, 5], [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 7, 7, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 7, 5, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5], [5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 7, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 7, 7, 7, 5, 0, 5, 7, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 7], [5, 5, 7, 7, 7, 2, 7, 5, 5, 7, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 5, 5], [5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], [7, 7, 5, 5, 5, 2, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 7], [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5], [5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 7768, "completion_tokens": 1217, "custom_id": "task_9caba7c3_req_cff147d2-9d5b-449a-88c6-18f8298b81f5", "batch_id": "batch_6825d618692c8190a21aeb84bdca18f5"}

Apply similar rule to test case: Modify the middle right number of horizontal group of 5 in the test input.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 6, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 3, 5, 0, 5, 6, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 8, 5, 0, 5, 5, 8, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 8, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 3, 5, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 3, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 8, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 5, 8, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 3, 5, 0, 5, 2, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 3, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 8, 5, 0, 5, 5, 8, 5, 0, 5, 5, 8, 5, 0, 5, 5, 8, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 6, 2, 5, 0, 5, 6, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 3, 5, 0, 5, 6, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 3, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 9673, "completion_tokens": 2274, "custom_id": "task_a096bf4d_req_bf324ba2-f5f6-43a9-8c5d-d831eda6c91c", "batch_id": "batch_6825d618692c8190a21aeb84bdca18f5"}

Apply this logic to the test grid, ensuring all `5`s become `2`s and appropriate padding surrounds any `4`.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 4282, "completion_tokens": 1946, "custom_id": "task_ff72ca3e_req_b6e9f4f6-de37-4c29-a161-e023477bcf9f", "batch_id": "batch_6825d618692c8190a21aeb84bdca18f5"}
