Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" The provided input examples: There are two examples:\n\nExample 1: \nInput:\n86\n64\nand output:\n868686\n646464\n686868\n464646\n868686\n646464\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n79\n43\nand output:\n797979\n434343\n979797\n343434\n797979\n434343\n\nTest Input: \n32\n78\n\nWait, I need to re-read carefully: The provided text:\nThe user provided several pairs of example input grids and corresponding outputs. They represent a hidden transformation rule. Finally, a single test input grid is provided. Our goal is to deduce the rule from the examples and apply it to test input grid to produce correct test output grid.\n\nWe have example 1: Input grid \"86\" on first row, \"64\" on second row. So matrix representation: two rows, two columns (since each row is a string digits). But output grid is six rows, each row is a six-digit row string. Wait, check: E.g. 1 Output: \n868686\n646464\n686868\n464646\n868686\n646464\n\nWait, how many rows? There are 6 rows. They are likely repeating pattern. Let's check: The pattern in the output seems to be alternating rows: first row is \"868686\", second row \"646464\", third row \"686868\", fourth row \"464646\", fifth row \"868686\", sixth row \"646464\". So the pattern is a repeating of two patterns with period 2, but not exactly. Let's check further: Possibly the transformation rule is \"tessellation\" or \"tile expansion\" using the given 2x2 input block. But output is 6 rows by 6 columns. That is 3 times height and 3 times width. Let's check: The original 2x2 grid, if scaled by factor 3, then the result would be a grid of 2*3=6 rows and 2*3=6 columns. And the pattern in the output is a repeating pattern that is consistent with a \"stencil\" of the original 2x2 block repeated in each 3x3 block.\n\nBut is that consistent? Let's check: If input grid is\nRow1: 8,6\nRow2: 6,4\nthen if we scale up by factor 3, each cell becomes a 3x3 block with that number repeated. Then the output grid would be:\nRow1: 8 repeated 3 times, then 6 repeated 3 times => \"888666\"? But output first row is \"868686\", not \"888666\". So not the standard block replication.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is something like: \"each input digit is repeated alternately in a checkered pattern\" or \"we are interlacing the rows and columns\". Let's check example 1 output: \"868686\". That row is alternatively digit \"8\" and \"6\". But then second row \"646464\": alternates \"6\" and \"4\". Third row \"686868\": alternates \"6\" and \"8\"? Wait, let's re-read carefully. The output rows:\n\nRow1: \"868686\". That sequence is: 8,6,8,6,8,6.\nRow2: \"646464\": 6,4,6,4,6,4.\nRow3: \"686868\": 6,8,6,8,6,8.\nRow4: \"464646\": 4,6,4,6,4,6.\nRow5: \"868686\": 8,6,8,6,8,6.\nRow6: \"646464\": 6,4,6,4,6,4.\n\nSo pattern: Rows 1,3,5 are same: \"8,6,8,6,8,6\", while rows 2,4,6 are same: \"6,4,6,4,6,4\". But wait, it's not exactly repeating the original rows because the original had two rows: first row: \"86\"; second row: \"64\". The row pattern in output: row 1 is same as input row1, row2 is same as input row2, row3 is a \"mix\" of row1 and row2's first element? Let's check: row1: \"86\" becomes \"868686\" i.e. each element is repeated 3 times? But then row2: \"64\" becomes \"646464\", but then row3: \"686868\" is not either \"86\" repeated thrice or \"64\" repeated thrice. It is a combination: row3: first digit 6, second digit 8, third digit 6, fourth digit 8, etc. That is the interlacing of row1 and row2's digits? Let's check: If we take row1 and row2: row1 = 8,6; row2 = 6,4, then interlace them: maybe column-wise interlacing: first column becomes 8,6, then second becomes 6,4, third? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's try to see pattern: The output grid has 6 rows and 6 columns. The input grid is 2 rows and 2 columns. Possibly the transformation rule is: Create a grid that is three times larger in both dimensions (so 6 rows and 6 columns). Then fill in the grid by alternating the digits from the original grid. Possibly the rule is: For each cell in the output grid, determine its \"parity\" of row and column indices, and then use the corresponding digit from the input grid based on parity. Let's test: Suppose we label the original grid as a 2x2 matrix, with indices (0,0)=8, (0,1)=6, (1,0)=6, (1,1)=4. Then output grid size: 6x6. We want to fill cell (i,j) with something. Let's try to see row pattern: For row1 (index 0), the digits are: 8,6,8,6,8,6. That is exactly the same as input row1? Actually if we take the input row1 (8,6) and repeat each element 3 times, we get 8,8,8,6,6,6, but output row1 is 8,6,8,6,8,6. So not that.\n\nMaybe each column is an alternation of two digits from the input grid. Let's check columns: Column 1 of output: digits: row1:8, row2:6, row3:6, row4:4, row5:8, row6:6. That column sequence is: 8,6,6,4,8,6. Column 2: 6,4,8,6,6,4. Column 3: 8,6,6,4,8,6, etc. So each column is identical to column 1? Let's check column 1 and column 3: 8,6,6,4,8,6. Column 2: 6,4,8,6,6,4. So they alternate. So maybe the rule is: The output grid is constructed by repeating a 2x3 pattern horizontally and vertically? Let's see: The output grid is 6x6. It might be constructed by 2x2 base blocks arranged in a pattern.\n\nMaybe we can notice that the output grid's first row is same as input row1 (8,6) repeated in alternating fashion? But not exactly.\n\nIdea: Look at the transformation from the 2x2 input to the 6x6 output:\nMaybe the rule: \"Scale up by a factor of 3, then apply a checkerboard swap on the two halves of each row.\" \nAlternatively, consider that the output grid has 3 copies of input row1 and 3 copies of input row2, but they are interwoven column-wise. Specifically, if we break the output grid into two sets of three rows each: top set rows 1,3,5 and bottom set rows 2,4,6. In the top set, each row is \"8,6,8,6,8,6\". In the bottom set, each row is \"6,4,6,4,6,4\". Now, how to get from input row \"86\" to \"868686\"? Possibly by writing the row's digits alternating with themselves? For instance, \"8\" becomes \"8\", then \"6\" becomes \"6\", then again \"8\", \"6\", ... That is just repeating the two-digit pattern three times. But then why row2 \"64\" becomes \"646464\"? That is just repeating \"64\" three times. But then how do we get row3 \"686868\"? It is not simply repeating row1 or row2. But maybe row3 is the result of interlacing the digits from row1 and row2: take first digit of row1 then first digit of row2, then second digit of row1 then second digit of row2, then repeat? That would yield: row1[0]=8, row2[0]=6, row1[1]=6, row2[1]=4, then repeat -> 8,6,6,4,8,6,4 but that gives 8,6,6,4,8,6,4", "prompt_tokens": 455, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We need to deduce transformation rule from examples 1-5 and then apply it to test input grid. The transformation rule is not explicitly given. We need to analyze the differences between input and output. Patterns: In each example, the grid remains same shape, but digits are replaced by different digits. The transformation is consistent across examples? Let's examine each.\n\nLet's list the examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nRow 0: 00000000000000\nRow 1: 00000008808800\nRow 2: 00000000888000\nRow 3: 00000888800000\nRow 4: 00008808008800\nRow 5: 00000008888000\nRow 6: 00000000808000\nRow 7: 00000088808880\nRow 8: 00000080000080\nRow 9: 00100000000000\nRow 10: 01110000000000\nRow 11: 00100000000000\nRow 12: 00000000000000\nRow 13: 00000000000000\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 00000000000000\nRow 1: 00000002202200\nRow 2: 00000000222000\nRow 3: 00000222200000\nRow 4: 00002202002200\nRow 5: 00000002222000\nRow 6: 00000000202000\nRow 7: 00000022202220\nRow 8: 00000020000020\nRow 9: 00000000000000\nRow 10: 00000000000000\nRow 11: 00000000000000\nRow 12: 00000000000000\nRow 13: 00000000000000\n\nObservation: Original digits \"0, 8, 8?\" Actually, in input, we see digits: The digits are \"0\", \"8\", and \"8\"? Actually, let\u2019s check: In input, digits: \"0\", \"8\", and sometimes \"8\"? Actually, look carefully. In row 1: \"00000008808800\". So digits: There's \"8\" in positions 6-7 maybe? Actually: \"000000\" then \"88\" then \"088\" then \"00\". The output row 1 becomes \"00000002202200\". So transformation: \"8\" becomes \"2\"? But not exactly. Let's check: In row 2: \"00000000888000\" becomes \"00000000222000\". So \"8\" becomes \"2\" but \"0\" remains \"0\". But then row 3: \"00000888800000\" becomes \"00000222200000\". So \"8\" becomes \"2\" remains consistent. But then in row 4: \"00008808008800\" becomes \"00002202002200\". So \"8\" becomes \"2\", \"0\" remains \"0\". But then notice: In row 7: \"00000088808880\" becomes \"00000022202220\". So pattern: \"8\" replaced by \"2\" if in that location it's contiguous? But then why sometimes \"8\" becomes \"2\" and sometimes maybe \"8\" becomes \"2\" but sometimes \"0\" remains \"0\"? Possibly the transformation is: Replace digit \"8\" with \"2\", and digit \"0\" remains \"0\" except in some cases? But then what about the \"088\" in row 1: the substring \"088\" becomes \"022\" in output. So digit \"0\" stays \"0\" except when adjacent to an \"8\"? Let's check row 1: \"088\" becomes \"022\". So the leftmost digit \"0\" becomes \"0\", but the \"8\" becomes \"2\", but the rightmost \"8\" becomes \"2\"? Actually, row1: \"088\" becomes \"022\". So does that mean \"8\" always becomes \"2\" regardless? But then row 4: \"088\" becomes \"022\"? Wait, row4 input is \"00008808008800\" and output is \"00002202002200\". Let's check the segments: \"088\" becomes \"022\" at beginning? But then \"80\" becomes \"20\"? Let's check carefully:\n\nMaybe transformation is simpler: Replace all occurrences of \"8\" with \"2\". But then what about \"0\"? Should they remain \"0\"? But then row 9 input: \"00100000000000\" becomes row 9 output: \"00000000000000\"? That means in row 9, input \"0\" remains \"0\", but now the leading \"0\" becomes \"0\"? That doesn't change. But row 10 input: \"01110000000000\" becomes row 10 output: \"00000000000000\". That means digit \"1\" becomes \"0\"? But then row 1 input: \"00000008808800\" becomes \"00000002202200\". So \"8\" become \"2\"? But then row 10: \"111\" becomes \"000\"? So maybe transformation is: Replace all digits with 0 except if they are \"8\" become \"2\", and \"1\" become \"0\"? But then row 2: \"00000000888000\" becomes \"00000000222000\". So \"8\" becomes \"2\". But then row 4 input: \"00008808008800\" becomes \"00002202002200\". The \"0\" remain \"0\". But row 10 input: \"01110000000000\" becomes \"00000000000000\". So \"1\" becomes \"0\"? But then row 11 input: \"00100000000000\" becomes \"00000000000000\". So \"1\" becomes \"0\"? But then row 9 input: \"00100000000000\" becomes \"00000000000000\"? So maybe transformation is: Replace non-zero digits with 0? But then row 1 input: \"088\" becomes \"022\", not \"000\". So not that.\n\nWait, let's re-read the examples:\n\nE.g. 1:\nRow 1: \"00000008808800\"\nOutput row 1: \"00000002202200\"\nMapping: 8 -> 2, but what about digit 0? They remain same.\nRow 2: \"00000000888000\" -> \"00000000222000\"\nMapping: 8 -> 2, 0 -> 0.\nRow 3: \"00000888800000\" -> \"00000222200000\"\nMapping: 8 -> 2.\nRow 4: \"00008808008800\" -> \"00002202002200\"\nMapping: 8 -> 2, but note digits: \"0\" remains 0.\nRow 5: \"00000008888000\" -> \"00000002222000\"\nMapping: 8 -> 2.\nRow 6: \"00000000808000\" -> \"00000000202000\"\nMapping: 8 ->2, digit \"0\" remains.\nRow 7: \"00000088808880\" -> \"00000022202220\"\nMapping: 8 ->2.\nRow 8: \"00000080000080\" -> \"00000020000020\"\nMapping: 8 ->2.\nRow 9: \"00100000000000\" -> \"00000000000000\"\nMapping: But then \"0\" remains \"0\", but \"1\" becomes \"0\"?\n\nRow 10: \"01110000000000\" -> \"00000000000000\"\nMapping: \"1\" becomes \"0\", \"0\" remains \"0\".\nRow 11: \"00100000000000\" -> \"00000000000000\"\nMapping: \"1\" becomes \"0\".\nRows 12 and 13 are all zeros.\n\nSo rule maybe: Replace digit 8 with 2, and replace digit 1 with 0? But then what about digit 0? They remain 0. Then check row 2: \"00000000888000\": only digits are 0 and 8, so all 8 become 2. Then row 4: \"00008808008800\": 8 becomes 2. So far so good.\n\nNow check example 2:\nInput:\nRow 0: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 1: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 2: \"00008808088000\"\nRow 3: \"00008080808000\"\nRow 4: \"00008808088000\"\nRow 5: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 6: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 7: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 8: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 9: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 10: \"00010100000000\"\nRow 11: \"00001000000000\"\nRow 12: \"00011100000000\"\nRow 13: \"00000000000000\"\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 1: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 2: \"00003303033000\"\nRow 3: \"00003030303000\"\nRow 4: \"00003303033000\"\nRow 5: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 6: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 7: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 8: \"00000000000000\"\nRow", "prompt_tokens": 1373, "completion_tokens": 2048}

They are likely the \"block transformation\" puzzles. Let's re-read examples.\n\nTask description: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" The examples are given in text: \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then a grid of text lines. They are provided as multi-line strings, each line is a row. We are given transformation from input to output.\n\nE.g. 1 input:\nlines:\n\"2222200\"\n\"2000200\"\n\"2020200\"\n\"2000200\"\n\"2222200\"\n\"0000000\"\n\"0000000\"\n\nOutput:\n\"2222200\"\n\"2888200\"\n\"2828200\"\n\"2888200\"\n\"2222200\"\n\"0000000\"\n\"0000000\"\n\nObserving transformation: Let me check the digits.\n\nIn example 1, there is a \"frame\" of digits. The input looks like a pattern with border of 2's and interior like zeros. But output: The border remains same: top row \"2222200\" remains same? Wait check: \"2222200\" is same as input? Actually input first row \"2222200\" equals output \"2222200\"? Yes. But second row \"2000200\" becomes \"2888200\". Third row \"2020200\" becomes \"2828200\". Fourth row \"2000200\" becomes \"2888200\". Fifth row \"2222200\" becomes \"2222200\". So the transformation rule seems to be: The two-digit pattern \"20\" gets replaced by \"28\" and \"08\" maybe? Let's check: \"2000200\" become \"2888200\": reading columns: col1: '2' remains same, col2: '0' becomes '8'? Actually let's check positions: Considering that the original row \"2000200\" becomes \"2888200\". So positions: index0: '2' remains '2'. index1: '0' becomes '8'; index2: '0' remains '0'? Wait, let's check carefully: \"2000200\" has 7 chars. Compare to output \"2888200\". Let's index positions 0..6:\nInput: 2,0,0,0,2,0,0\nOutput: 2,8,8,8,2,0,0.\nSo transformation: The center positions (indices 1,2,3) changed from 0 to 8? But wait, check third row: \"2020200\" becomes \"2828200\". Input: 2,0,2,0,2,0,0. Output: 2,8,2,8,2,0,0. So pattern: it seems like: In the interior, some positions become 8 if they are originally 0? But notice positions index 0 and index 5 and index 6 remain same always. But then look at row 2: \"2000200\" becomes \"2888200\": positions 1,2,3 become 8,8,8. And row 3: \"2020200\" becomes \"2828200\": positions 1 becomes 8, position3 becomes 8, but position2 remains 2 => Wait, then rule might be: if the cell in the border? Let's re-read examples.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Replace all occurrences of the digit 0 that are adjacent to a 2 on the border with 8\"? But then example 1: row 2: \"2000200\" becomes \"2888200\"? How to decide which zeros turn into 8?\nMaybe it's something like: \"Expand the pattern by 8's in the interior of the region delineated by outer border of 2's\" maybe? Actually, check: The border of 2's remains unchanged: top row is all 2's. bottom row is all 2's? Actually, example1: rows 1 and 5 are border rows. But the inside rows get transformed. Let's check e.g. 2.\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\nRow1: \"222222200\"\nRow2: \"200000200\"\nRow3: \"200000200\"\nRow4: \"200200200\"\nRow5: \"200000200\"\nRow6: \"200000200\"\nRow7: \"222222200\"\nRow8: \"000000000\"\nRow9: \"000000000\"\nOutput:\nRow1: \"222222200\" (unchanged)\nRow2: \"244444200\"\nRow3: \"244444200\"\nRow4: \"244244200\"\nRow5: \"244444200\"\nRow6: \"244444200\"\nRow7: \"222222200\"\nRow8: \"000000000\" (unchanged)\nRow9: \"000000000\"\n\nObserving e.g. 2: The top border remains unchanged, bottom border remains unchanged. The interior gets \"4\" inserted. In row2: \"200000200\" turns into \"244444200\". Compare: originally row2: 2,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0? Actually, each row has 9 characters. Let's index positions:\nRow2 original: \"200000200\" (9 digits) becomes \"244444200\". So digits 0 remains, but positions 1,2,3,4,5 are replaced with 4's? But check row4: \"200200200\" becomes \"244244200\". So now the interior: first 2 remains same, then 0 becomes 4, then 0 becomes 2? Actually, let's index row4 original: \"200200200\". That is: digit0:2, digit1:0, digit2:0, digit3:2, digit4:0, digit5:0, digit6:2, digit7:0, digit8:0.\nOutput row4: \"244244200\": digits: 2,4,4,2,4,4,2,0,0. So digits positions: index1 becomes 4, index2 becomes 4, index3 remains 2, index4 becomes 4, index5 becomes 4, index6 remains 2. So it seems the pattern is: The digits on the border (first and last column) remain unchanged. The interior columns: if they are originally 0, they become 4, except if they are already a 2? But then, row4 originally had a 2 at index3, which stayed 2. But then row2 originally had no 2's except at index0 and index8. So rule: It's like a \"paint\" that changes every interior cell that is not on the border? But then e.g. 1: The interior digits in row2 \"2000200\" becomes \"2888200\". But then row3 \"2020200\" becomes \"2828200\". So pattern: It is not simply replacing 0 with 8, because row3 had a 2 in the middle (index2) and that remains 2. But wait, check row3: \"2020200\": digits: index0:2, index1:0, index2:2, index3:0, index4:2, index5:0, index6:0 become \"2828200\": index1 becomes 8, index3 becomes 8, index? Actually, check: \"2828200\": digits: 2,8,2,8,2,0,0. So that means interior positions that are originally 0 become 8, while positions that are originally 2 remain 2. But then why in row2, \"2000200\" becomes \"2888200\" where every interior digit is 0 becomes 8? But then row3 \"2020200\", index2 was 2 and remains 2. So transformation in e.g. 1: It seems they are taking the pattern of 2's and 0's, and replacing all \"0\" in the interior with 8, except preserving any 2's in the interior. But then e.g. 2: interior 0's become 4, and the 2's remain 2. e.g. 3: \nInput first few lines of e.g. 3:\nLine1: \"000000222222222\" becomes \"000000222222222\" (unchanged)\nLine2: \"000000200000002\" becomes \"000000233333332\"\nLine3: \"000000200000002\" becomes \"000000233333332\"\nLine4: \"000000200000002\" becomes \"000000233333332\"\nLine5: \"000000200020002\" becomes \"000000233323332\"\nLine6: \"000000200000002\" becomes \"000000233333332\"\nLine7: \"000000200000002\" becomes \"000000233333332\"\nLine8: \"000000200000002\" becomes \"000000233333332\"\nLine9: \"000000222222222\" becomes \"000000222222222\"\nLine10: \"000000000000000\" remains \"000000000000000\"\nLine11: \"022222000000000\" becomes \"028882000000000\"\nLine12: \"020002000000000\" becomes \"028282000000000\"\nLine13: \"020202000000000\" becomes \"028282000000000\"\nLine14: \"020002000000000\" becomes \"028882000000000\"\nLine15: \"022222000000000\" becomes \"022222000000000\" Wait check line15:", "prompt_tokens": 1059, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check differences.\n\nObserving each example, the output grid seems to be a transformation where numbers in the input grid \"move\" upward along the left border and are replaced with zeros? Wait, let\u2019s analyze carefully.\n\nObserving Example 1 input and output:\nInput:\nRow 0: \"0000000000\"\nRow 1: \"0000000000\"\nRow 2: \"0000000000\"\nRow 3: \"0000000000\"\nRow 4: \"0000000000\"\nRow 5: \"0000000000\"\nRow 6: \"0000000004\"\nRow 7: \"1100000004\"\nRow 8: \"1102203304\"\nRow 9: \"1102203304\"\n\nOutput:\nRow0: \"1100000000\"\nRow1: \"1100000000\"\nRow2: \"1220000000\"\nRow3: \"0233000000\"\nRow4: \"0034000000\"\nRow5: \"0004000000\"\nRow6: \"0004000000\"\nRow7: \"0004000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nObserving differences:\nIt seems the digits from the bottom are being \"pushed\" upward. The rightmost column in input (last digit) seems to be \"4\" in some rows. In output, those \"4\"s have moved leftwards. But not sure.\n\nLet's examine columns: It is a 10x10 grid. Possibly the transformation is \"rotate\" or \"reflect\" digits? But the examples: In Example 1, the bottom row of input is \"1102203304\". The output first row is \"1100000000\", and second row is \"1100000000\". It seems that the bottom two rows get \"shifted\" upward. The numbers \"1102203304\" become \"1100000000\" in row0, then \"1100000000\" in row1, then \"1220000000\" in row2, then \"0233000000\" row3, \"0034000000\" row4, \"0004000000\" row5, etc. Wait, let's compare row by row.\n\nMapping input to output: \n- The bottom-most row in input (row9) is \"1102203304\", but in output, the bottom-most row is all zeros.\n- The next row (row8) is \"1102203304\" and becomes row something? Actually, let's check: Output row9 is \"0000000000\", row8 is \"0000000000\", row7 is \"0004000000\", row6 is \"0004000000\", row5 is \"0004000000\", row4 is \"0034000000\", row3 is \"0233000000\", row2 is \"1220000000\", row1 is \"1100000000\", row0 is \"1100000000\".\nSo if we read columns from right to left, it looks like the input bottom rows \"1102203304\" have been \"shifted\" upward and then \"spilled\" leftwards.\n\nMaybe the transformation is: read the grid from bottom-right corner upward, and then write digits leftwards, each digit appears as many times as its value? Or maybe it's like \"gravity\" simulation. Let's re-read the examples carefully.\n\nExample 1: The interesting patterns: In the input, the bottom part (rows 6-9) are non-zero. In output, the bottom part (rows 8-9) are zeros. The non-zero numbers appear in rows 0-7. Also, in output, the digits appear in columns from right to left, with a shift. Possibly the rule: The transformation takes the digits in the bottom row (or a contiguous block from bottom) and shifts them upward, with each digit appearing as many times as its value? Let's check: In Example 1, the bottom row input (row9) is \"1102203304\". If we count numbers: '1' appears twice, then '0' appears? No, let's check row9 input digits: \"1,1,0,2,2,0,3,3,0,4\". In output row0: \"1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\". Row1: same. Row2: \"1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\". Row3: \"0,2,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\". Row4: \"0,0,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\". Row5: \"0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\". Row6: \"0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\". Row7: \"0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0\". So, it looks like the digits from the bottom row are being \"pulled\" up one row at a time. But then what about the digits in row8 and row7? They are \"1102203304\" as well. But then row6 input is \"0000000004\", which only has a 4 at the end. So in output, rows 6,7,8 are \"0004000000\" on row6, row7, and row8 \"0000000000\". So the transformation is not simply a vertical shift.\n\nMaybe it's like \"gravity\" in a different direction? Perhaps the rule: \"Take all non-zero digits and move them to the top-left corner, preserving order, and fill the rest with zeros.\" But then check Example 1: In input, non-zero digits appear in rows 6-9. But in output, the non-zero digits appear in rows 0-7. But then the order: The rightmost column of each row in input is always 4 in rows 6-9 (and 0 in rows 0-5). But in output, that 4 appears in the 4th column from right? Let's check: In output row5, the digit 4 appears in column index", "prompt_tokens": 771, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Counting lines: Actually the given text is not clearly separated by line numbers, but the transformation example has multiple rows. We have to analyze structure.\n\nMaybe easier: The transformation rule might be something like: It changes some digits in certain positions. Observing differences between input and output.\n\nE.g. 1 Input and Output changes:\n\nLet's compare E.g. 1 Input and Output grids line by line:\nThey are 32 rows each in E.g. 1 maybe. Let's try to identify consistent patterns.\n\nI'll denote input rows as I1, I2, ..., I32, and output rows as O1, etc. But maybe we can identify region boundaries.\n\nObserving E.g. 1 Input:\nThere is a region in the top part, then a row with \"888888888888888888888888888888\". So row where the 8888 appears is row 11 (if we count starting at 1) but actually check: Actually line 11 in e.g. 1 input is \"888888888888888888888888888888\". And in E.g. 1 Output, row 11 is \"888888888888888888888888888888\". So that row remains same.\n\nThen further down, row 21 input is \"000000000000020000000022000000\". In output row 21 is \"000880000880020008880028880000\". So digits changed from \"0\" to \"8\" in some positions.\n\nAlso row 22 input \"200220020200220002020022200200\" becomes \"200880020880220008880028880200\" in output. So transformation might be adding 8's in some columns.\n\nObserving the transformation in E.g. 1: Many columns changed from 0 to 3, 4, 8? Let's examine rows near row 4. E.g. 1 Input row4: \"000000000040000004440000000000\". Output row4: \"000000000030000003330000000000\". So digits \"4\" become \"3\" in some positions, but \"4\" becomes \"3\"? Wait, check: In input row4, digits: \"040000004440000000000\", then output: \"030000003330000000000\". So pattern: \"4\" becomes \"3\", \"0\" remains \"0\"? But then row5: Input \"000000000440000004440000000000\" becomes \"000000000330000003330000000000\". So similar: \"4\" becomes \"3\", \"0\" remains \"0\". But then row6: Input \"000440000000000000000000440000\" becomes \"000330000440000004440000330000\". Wait, check row6: Input row6: \"000440000000000000000000440000\". Output row6: \"000330000440000004440000330000\". So what happened? The \"4\" in the left part might have become \"3\", but the \"4\" in the right part might have been transformed to \"4\"? Actually, let's analyze row6: It has two \"4\" groups: \"440\" at beginning and \"440\" at end? Actually row6 input: \"000440000000000000000000440000\". It seems the \"4\" block in the beginning \"440\" becomes \"330\" in output row6? But then the right \"440\" becomes \"440\" in output? But actually output row6: \"000330000440000004440000330000\". It has \"330\" in left, then later \"440\", then later \"440\", then \"330\". So it seems the transformation might be mirroring some digits? Let's compare row6 in input: \"000440000000000000000000440000\". There are two occurrences of \"440\" that are separated by a gap. In output, the left occurrence \"440\" becomes \"330\" and the right occurrence \"440\" becomes \"440\"? Not sure.\n\nLet's check row7: Input row7: \"000000000000000000000000440000\" becomes output row7: \"000330000440000004440000330000\". Wait, row7 input is \"000000000000000000000000440000\" (only one group \"440\" at right) but output row7 has two groups \"330\" and \"440\" and \"330\". So row7: \"000000000000000000000000440000\" becomes \"000330000440000004440000330000\". That is interesting because row7 input has one group \"440\", but output row7 has three groups: \"330\", then \"440\", then \"330\". So transformation might be adding columns or splitting groups.\n\nMaybe the rule is something like: It draws a pattern of 8's and 3's etc. Wait, check e.g. row4 and row5: They changed 4 to 3 in the 4-digit group, but then row6 and row7: The left group becomes 330 instead of 440? Actually, let's re-read row6 and row7 carefully.\n\nE.g. 1 Input rows:\nRow4: \"000000000040000004440000000000\" -> Output: \"000000000030000003330000000000\"\nRow5: \"000000000440000004440000000000\" -> Output: \"000000000330000003330000000000\"\nRow6: \"000440000000000000000000440000\" -> Output: \"000330000440000004440000330000\"\nRow7: \"000000000000000000000000440000\" -> Output: \"000330000440000004440000330000\"\n\nSo row6 and row7 output are identical? They are both \"000330000440000004440000330000\". So for row7, input \"000000000000000000000000440000\" transformed to that same pattern. So the transformation seems to add extra digits on the left, middle, and right. Specifically, the final output row seems to have pattern \"000330000440000004440000330000\". The input row7 had only one group \"440\" at the end. So maybe the rule is: wherever there is a contiguous group of 4's, replace it with a pattern \"330\" then \"440\" then \"440\" then \"330\"? But that doesn't hold for row4: \"040000004", "prompt_tokens": 2731, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Observe that the output grids are more simplified versions of the input grids, with many of the elements being replaced by 0s.\n2. Identify that the transformation primarily affects the non-zero elements, converting them to 0s except for certain repeated patterns.\n3.

The input row: There is \"30\" at column 9-10? Actually let's examine: The input row has \"0000000000\" then \"300003000000\"? Wait, let me parse: The string is of length 20 characters. Let me index columns from 0 to 19.\nRow 0: \"0000000000300003000000\". There are zeros except for digits \"3\" at positions?

Actually each example seems to be 20 characters wide, but row 0 in E.g.1 is \"0000000000300003000000\". Count characters: should be 20 characters. Let's count: \n\"0000000000\" (10 zeros) then \"300003000000\" but that would be 10 more? Actually, let me count carefully: the string \"0000000000300003000000\" length is 23? Let's count: \"0000000000\" = 10, then \"300003000000\" = 12, then \"000\" = 3, so total 10+12+3=25, not 20. Wait maybe the grid dimensions are not constant? Let's re-read the problem. It says \"provided input grid\" and \"output grid\" and then \"JSON list of lists\" for final test grid. They are provided as strings with no spaces maybe. They might actually be multi-line strings each row is a string. But example E.g. 1: There are 22 lines? Let's count lines in E.g. 1 Input:\nI see:\n0000000000300003000000\n0066666600666636000000\n0088338800833388000000\n0088338800883388003000\n0388338800883383000300\n0388338800883388300000\n0000000000300000000000\n0300030000000000000000\n0066666600663666000000\n0088338800383383030003\n0088333800383388000000\n0088338800833338000000\n3388338800883388000000\n0000000000000300003000\n0000000003003000000000\n0066366603666366000000\n0088338800883388000030\n0083338800883388000000\n0088338800883388000000\n0088338800883388000000\n0000003300000000000000\n0000000003003000300000\n0000000300000000000000\n\nCount lines: There are 22 lines. And E.g.1 Output has 22 lines too. So grid dimensions vary by example, not necessarily square? Possibly they are 22 rows by ? columns. Let's count columns of first row in E.g.1 Input. \"0000000000300003000000\"\nCount: I can count manually:\n\"0000000000\" = 10 zeros, then \"300003000000\" = 12 characters? Actually, it's \"300003000000\" then \"0000\" maybe? Let's count: \nI can count by grouping digits in groups of 5 maybe: \"00000\" (5), \"00000\" (10), \"00300\" (15), \"00300\" (20), \"00000\" (25) So row length 25. \nLet's check row1: \"0066666600666636000000\" count: \"00\" (2) then \"6666660\" (8) then \"0666636\" (8) then \"000000\" (6) equals 2+8+8+6=24. Wait that doesn't match. Let's recalc: I'll count manually: \nRow1: \"0066666600666636000000\". Count characters:\nPositions: 0:0,1:0,2:6,3:6,4:6,5:6,6:6,7:6,8:0,9:0,10:6,11:6,12:6,13:6,14:6,15:3,16:6,17:0,18:0,19:0,20:0,21:0,22:0,23:0 maybe? \nThat string length is 24? Let's count properly: I'll count digits group by group: \"00\" (2), \"666666\" (6 digits) so total 8, then \"00666636\" (8 more?) Actually, let me copy row1 exactly: \"0066666600666636000000\". Count: \nIndices:\n0:0\n1:0\n2:6\n3:6\n4:6\n5:6\n6:6\n7:6\n8:0\n9:0\n10:6\n11:6\n12:6\n13:6\n14:6\n15:3\n16:6\n17:0\n18:0\n19:0\n20:0\n21:0\n22:0? Possibly length is 23? Let me count manually in groups:\nI can break it into groups of 5 if possible: \n\"00\" then \"66666\" then \"00666\" then \"360000\" but that doesn't evenly divide.\nMaybe the dimensions are not consistent across examples. \nWait the problem statement in ARC tasks often have grids with fixed dimensions. Possibly each example grid is rectangular. They might have different dimensions. But we need to infer transformation rule. Let's look at E.g. 1 transformation pattern.\n\nComparing E.g. 1 Input and Output row by row:\nRow 0: Input: \"0000000000300003000000\"\nOutput: \"0000000000000000000000\"\nSo what changed?

The task is that the user gave pairs of examples (3 pairs) and then a \"Test Input\" grid: \n\"003\n330\n030\" presumably. Wait carefully, the problem description: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" We are given several pairs of examples (E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3). The transformation rule is hidden. We must deduce the rule.\n\nLet's check the examples:\n\nE.g. 1: Input (grid) is:\nRow1: \"070\"\nRow2: \"777\"\nRow3: \"070\"\n\nOutput (grid) is:\nRow1: \"000707000\"\nRow2: \"000000000\"\nRow3: \"000707000\"\nRow4: \"707707707\"\nRow5: \"000000000\"\nRow6: \"707707707\"\nRow7: \"000707000\"\nRow8: \"000000000\"\nRow9: \"000707000\".\n\nObserving the pattern: Input is a 3x3 grid. Output is a 9x9 grid. So the transformation rule might be doing some kind of expansion using a pattern repeated? Let's check details.\n\nObserving E.g. 1 input:\n070\n777\n070\n\nFirstly, note the pattern \"070\" repeated in row pattern? But output is 9 rows, each with 9 columns.\n\nMaybe the transformation is \"blowing up\" each cell into a 3x3 block, but then combining some pattern? Let's check: If we \"blow up\" each cell into a 3x3 block, then cell value x becomes a block of 3x3 with that digit repeated. But then the output should be (3 * 3) = 9 rows, 9 columns. That fits: For a 3x3 grid, the blow-up would give a 9x9 grid. But then the output pattern: Let's check cell positions. In blow-up, the top left cell is input[0,0] = '0'? Then its block would be all zeros. But the output top left block should be 3x3 of zeros. But in the given output, first row is \"000707000\". That doesn't match. Let's check: If we do a simple blow-up, then top left block would be output[0:3, 0:3] = \"0\" repeated. But the output row1 is \"000707000\". It splits into segments maybe: first three columns are \"000\", then next three columns are \"707\", then right three columns are \"000\". Possibly the rule is: each cell is replaced by a 3x3 block that consists of the digit in a cross pattern? Alternatively, maybe the transformation is \"tile\" the input pattern across the output grid in a cross pattern arrangement.\n\nLet's check e.g. 1: Input: 070, 777, 070. Compare with output: They have pattern \"070\" appears in some rows: row1: \"000707000\", row3: \"000707000\", row7: \"000707000\", row9: \"000707000\". Also row4 and row6: \"707707707\". And row2, row5, row8: \"000000000\". So the transformation might be: expand each cell to a 3x3 block, but then the cross pattern of the original matrix is placed in the center of the block? Wait, let's check the relation: In the blow-up, the i-th row and j-th column of input will correspond to block row (3*i to 3*i+2) and column block (3*j to 3*j+2). For e.g. input[0,0] which is '0' should produce block of zeros if it's a simple blow up. But in output, block corresponding to input[0,0] would be rows 0-2, columns 0-2. But output row0 columns0-2 are \"000\". That fits. Now input[0,1] is '7'. Its block in blow-up would be rows 0-2, columns 3-5. But output row0 columns3-5 are \"707\". That is interesting: They are not all '7's. It is \"707\", which is like a pattern with the middle being 0? Let's check input[0,2] is '0'. Its block in blow-up (rows 0-2, columns 6-8) should be \"000\". And output row0 columns6-8 are \"000\". So row0 of output is: block from input[0,0] \"000\", block from input[0,1] \"707\", block from input[0,2] \"000\". So maybe the rule: For each cell, if the input digit is '7', then the output block is \"707\" horizontally (not all same digit, but with middle 0). If input digit is '0', then the block is \"000\" horizontally. Let's check row1: input row1: \"777\". For each cell in row1, if digit is '7', then block becomes \"707\" horizontally. So row1, columns 0-2: from input[1,0] -> \"707\", columns 3-5: from input[1,1] -> \"707\", columns 6-8: from input[1,2] -> \"707\". But row1 in output is \"000000000\", which is all zeros. So that doesn't match the above hypothesis. Wait, but perhaps the transformation is not a simple blow-up; it might be cross-correlation with a pattern kernel. Let's check pattern using coordinates.\n\nObserving E.g. 1 output grid:\nIndex rows:\nRow1: 000 707 000\nRow2: 000 000 000\nRow3: 000 707 000\nRow4: 707 707 707\nRow5: 000 000 000\nRow6: 707 707 707\nRow7: 000 707 000\nRow8: 000 000 000\nRow9: 000 707 000\n\nI see a pattern: the pattern \"707\" appears in row1, row3, row7, row9 at the middle block. And row4 and row6 are entirely \"707\". Also, there is \"000\" in the corners and borders.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Place the input grid in a 3x3 cross shape pattern at the center of the output grid?\" Actually, wait: The output grid is 9x9. The input grid is 3x3. And it appears as if the output is composed of 3 copies of the input grid, but rotated or reflected? Let's check: If I take the input grid and rotate it 90 degrees or reflect it, I might get a pattern that appears in the output. For example, if I place the input grid in the center of the output grid, then mirror it horizontally and vertically? Let's check: The output grid's center 3x3 block (rows 4,5,6 and columns 4,5,6) is \"707707707\". Is that equal to input grid? Input grid is:\nRow1: 070\nRow2: 777\nRow3: 070\nNot equal. But if I reflect input horizontally, I get:\nRow1: 070 becomes 070 (the same because symmetric? Actually, \"070\" reversed is \"070\", so it's symmetric horizontally if we consider digits: 0,7,0 reversed is 0,7,0, so it's the same).\nRow2: 777 reversed is 777 (same)\nRow3: 070 reversed is 070 (same).\nSo the input is symmetric horizontally and vertically? Actually, check vertical: 0,7,0 becomes same if reversed? Actually, if we reverse rows: row3 becomes row1, so yes, it's symmetric vertically. So input is symmetric across both axes. So the input grid is symmetric. Then its blow-up might be arranged in a 3x3 pattern of copies, but with some modifications.\n\nI see the output grid is structured as a 3x3 grid of 3x3 blocks. And each block is either \"000\" or \"707\" or \"707707707\" is one block? Let's break output into nine blocks: Let the output grid be divided into 3 rows of blocks, each block is 3 columns by 3 rows. Blocks positions: block (i, j) corresponds to output rows 3*i to 3*i+2 and columns 3*j to 3*j+2.\n\nLet's label blocks for e.g. 1:\nBlock (0,0): rows 0-2, columns 0-2: That is \"000\" from row0 \"000\", row1 \"000\", row2 \"000\"? Actually check row1 block (0,0) is \"000\" from row1 columns 0-2 (\"000\")? But row1 is \"000000000\", so yes.\nBlock (0,1): rows 0-2, columns 3-5: That block appears to be \"707\" in each row? Let's check: row0 columns3-5: \"707\", row1 columns3-5: \"000\"? Wait, check row1: \"000000000\", so columns3-5 are \"000\". Row2: \"000707000\", so columns", "prompt_tokens": 553, "completion_tokens": 2048}

In input, there are numbers: 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 appear isolated. In output, we see transformation: Some numbers become repeated digits, e.g. \"2\" becomes \"2\", but sometimes \"3\" becomes \"3\" but sometimes \"3\" becomes \"33\" or \"333\"? Let's see.\n\nLet's mark coordinates with changes.\n\nI'll reconstruct grid coordinates for e.g. 1 input and output.\n\nCoordinates: rows 0-indexed? I'll use row numbers as given lines.\n\nRow 1 (index 0): Input: \"00000000000000000000\", Output: \"00000000000000000000\". No change.\n\nRow 2 (index 1): Input: \"00000000000000000000\", Output: \"00000000000000000000\". No change.\n\nRow 3 (index 2): Input: \"00000020000000000000\", Output: \"00000020000000000000\". No change.\n\nRow 4 (index 3): Input: \"00000000000000000000\", Output: \"00000020000000000000\". So here, output has \"20000000000000000000\". Where did the 2 come from? It seems that maybe the 2 from row3 column? Wait, check row3 output is \"00000020000000000000\". But row4 output has \"20000000000000000000\". That means the digit \"2\" has moved one row down? Possibly it moved from row 3, col 7? But row3 input \"20000000000000000000\" has digit 2 at col 6? Let's check: \"00000020000000000000\" means that there is a \"2\" in the 7th position (0-indexed col6) if counting from left. But row3 output is same as row3 input. Row4 output has \"20000000000000000000\", so maybe the 2 moved from row3 to row4? But row3 input actually is \"00000020000000000000\". Wait, let me check row3 input exactly: \"00000020000000000000\". Counting: 0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,... So the \"2\" is at col6 (0-indexed). But row3 output is identical \"00000020000000000000\". And row4 output is \"00000020000000000000\". That means row4 output now has a leading \"2\"? But no, row4 output is \"00000020000000000000\" but wait, check carefully:\nRow 3 input: \"00000020000000000000\"\nRow 4 output: \"00000020000000000000\"\nBut row 3 output: \"00000020000000000000\"\nBut then row 4 output: \"00000020000000000000\" seems to be identical to row3 input. That doesn't show a shift.\n\nMaybe I mis-assumed row numbering.

Output for example 2:\nRow0: \"00000000000\"\nRow1: \"00000000000\"\nRow2: \"00000000000\"\nRow3: \"00000000000\"\nRow4: \"00333333200\"\nRow5: \"00200000200\"\nRow6: \"00203310200\"\nRow7: \"00202000200\"\nRow8: \"00202000200\"\nRow9: \"00202333300\"\nRow10:\"00200000000\"\nRow11:\"00000000000\"\nSo grid same shape.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: \nRow0: \"530000000000\" => length 13 digits.\nRow1: \"000000000000\" length 13\nRow2: \"000000000000\" length 13\nRow3: \"000000000000\" length 13\nRow4: \"000000000000\" length 13\nRow5: \"000000000000\" length 13\nRow6: \"000001000000\" length 13\nRow7: \"000000000000\" length 13\nRow8: \"000000000000\" length 13\nRow9: \"000000000000\" length 13\nRow10:\"000000000000\" length 13\nRow11:\"000000000000\" length 13\nRow12:\"000000000000\" length 13\nSo grid: 13x13.\nOutput for example 3:\nRow0: \"000000000000\" length 13\nRow1: \"000000000000\"\nRow2: \"555555555300\" length 13? Let's check: \"555555555300\" is 13 digits. \nRow3: \"000000000300\"\nRow4: \"055555530300\"\nRow5: \"030000030300\"\nRow6: \"030551030300\"\nRow7: \"030300030300\"\nRow8: \"030300030300\"\nRow9: \"030355550300\"\nRow10:\"030000000300\"\nRow11:\"035555555500\"\nRow12:\"000000000000\"\n\nTest Input:\n\"2800000000000\" length 13, then 13 rows total? Let's check: There are lines:\nRow0: \"2800000000000\"\nRow1: \"0000000000000\"\nRow2: \"0000000000000\"\nRow3: \"0000000000000\"\nRow4: \"0000000000000\"\nRow5: \"0000001000000\"\nRow6: \"0000000000000\"\nRow7: \"0000000000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000000\"\nRow10:\"0000000000000\"\nRow11:\"0000000000000\"\nRow12:\"0000000000000\"\nSo grid: 13 rows, 13 columns.\n\nWe need to deduce transformation rule from these examples.\n\nObserving examples:\nExample 1: input and output are both 12x11 grids. Example 2: 12x11 grid as well. Example 3: 13x13 grid. The transformation rule seems to involve \"3\" and \"5\" and \"0\" and \"1\", \"6\", etc.\n\nLet me denote positions by coordinates maybe as (row, col) indices.\nI suspect the transformation rule is: There is some structure: The input grid has one non-zero element in one row that indicates \"seed\" or \"starting point\" maybe. For example, in example 1, row0 is \"56000000000\" and row4 is \"00010000000\". So there are two non-zero digits in input: 5 at col0 of row0, and 1 at col4 of row4. In output, we see numbers 5, 6, 0, 1, etc. In output, row2: \"55555600000\" has many 5's. row4: \"05510600000\" has 5 and 1 and 6. row7: \"06555500000\" has 6 and 5's. That suggests a pattern that might be \"spreading\" from two points maybe.\n\nExample 2: Input has \"32000000000\" at row0 and \"00000010000\" at row6. So two non-zero digits: 3 at col0 of row0, and 1 at col? Wait, row6 \"00000010000\": where is the 1? It is at col? Counting: \"00000010000\" => 7 zeros then 1 then 0000? Actually, let's count: \"00000010000\" is 11 characters. So the first 6 zeros then \"1\" at position 6 index if indexing from 0? Let's count: indices 0-5 are zeros, index 6 is \"1\", then indices 7-10 zeros. So input has 3 at (0,0) and 1 at (6,6)? But then output: row4: \"00333333200\": It has 3 repeated? Actually, row4 in output: \"00333333200\": So there is 0 at col0, then 333333 at col1-col6? Wait, \"00333333200\" is 11 digits: index0:0, index1:0, then indices 2:3,3:3,4:3,5:3,6:3,7:3, then index8:2, index9:0, index10:0. Row5: \"00200000200\", row6: \"00203310200\", row7: \"00202000200\", row8: \"00202000200\", row9: \"00202333300\", row10:\"00200000000\". This pattern might be \"spreading\" from the two points with different colors. It seems the output is a pattern that is like a rectangle or maybe two connected regions that are \"filled\" with certain numbers? They seem to form shapes that look like plus signs or cross shapes.\n\nI recall ARC problems often involve \"spreading\" or \"filling\" along diagonals, or \"rotating\" patterns, or \"mirroring\" or \"translation\" of digits.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: Given an input grid, find all nonzero digits. They are \"seed\" points. Then, starting from those seeds, \"spread\" their value outward in some manner along rows and columns, but with modifications? Let's analyze more concretely.\n\nExample 1: Input grid of size 12x11.\nNonzero cells: (0,0)=5, (4,4)=1? Wait, check: row4: \"00010000000\": so that is at column index 4.\nNow look at output:\nRow2: \"55555600000\": That row, what are the values? It has digits: index0:5, index1:5, index2:5, index3:5, index4:5, index5:6, then zeros.\nRow3: \"00000600000\": So row3: there is a 6 at column index 5.\nRow4: \"05510600000\": row4: digit 0 at col0? Actually, it's \"05510600000\": that is 11 digits: index0:0, index1:5, index2", "prompt_tokens": 839, "completion_tokens": 2048}

They look like maybe they are \"digit sequences\"? Let's analyze each.\n\nWe have E.g.1: The provided input is a list of 31 lines? Wait, let's count lines. The e.g. 1 input: Counting lines from the text: It seems the input is provided as one block of text with newlines. Let me count lines possibly. It seems e.g. 1 input: number of lines? Actually, we see lines: \"311956711457399119937541176591\" is one line, \"139565174175431331345714715659\" is second, \"693171569914911441194199651713\" is third, \"911317659941134114311499567131\" is fourth, \"666731593491672552761943951376\" is fifth, \"667613919313765225673139193167\" is sixth, \"676619319114696776964119139166\" is seventh, \"766696131341967667691431318888\" is eighth, \"149939911161525555251611198888\" is ninth, \"419943131116255555526111318888\" is tenth, \"571491142211555225551122418888\" is eleventh, \"754113412111552552551112143114\" is twelfth, \"349167697633116116113367967619\" is thirteenth, \"931376966733111661113376696731\" is fourteenth, \"911425673376121111216733765241\" is fifteenth, \"134152763367221111227633672514\" is sixteenth, \"134152763367221111227633672514\" is seventeenth, \"911425673376121111216733765241\" is eighteenth, \"931376966733111661113376696731\" is nineteenth, \"349167697633116116113367967619\" is twentieth, \"754113412111552552551112143114\" is twenty-first, \"571491142211555225551122411941\" is twenty-second, \"419943131116255555526111313499\" is twenty-third, \"149939911161525555251611199399\" is twenty-fourth, \"766696131341967667691431316966\" is twenty-fifth, \"676619319114696776964119139166\" is twenty-sixth, \"667613919313765225673139193167\" is twenty-seventh, \"666731593491672552761943951376\" is twenty-eighth, \"911317659941134114311499567131\" is twenty-ninth, \"693171569914911441194199651713\" is thirtieth.\n\nSo there are 30 lines in e.g.1 input. And e.g. 1 output is 4 lines:\n\"6966\n9399\n3499\n1941\"\n\nSo what transformation rule might be mapping 30-digit rows to 4-digit output lines? Possibly the transformation is to sum up columns, or extract certain diagonal elements? Possibly the transformation rule is to extract certain positions from each row.\n\nMaybe the trick: In ARC tasks, sometimes the transformation rule is to take the \"diagonals\" of the grid. But here, input grid is irregular shape? Wait, let's check sizes: Each input line in e.g.1 is length maybe 30 digits? Check first line \"311956711457399119937541176591\" is 30 digits? Let's count: digits: \"3 1 1 9 5 6 7 1 1 4 5 7 3 9 9 1 1 9 3 7 5 4 1 1 7 6 5 9 1\" That is 30 digits. So each input row is 30 digits, and there are 30 rows. So it's a 30x30 grid. And the output is 4 lines, each line has 4 digits. That is a 4x4 grid.\n\nMaybe the rule is to take the four corners of the grid? But corners of 30x30 would be 4 numbers, but then how do we get 4 lines of 4 numbers? Possibly the rule is to take the border elements? However, border of a 30x30 grid would be 30+30+28+28 = 116 numbers, not 16.\n\nMaybe it's a constraint transformation: It might be to compute some function on rows and columns.\n\nLet's check e.g. 2: The input grid for e.g.2: It might be of size?

But then I note the following:\n- In the output, some regions get digits \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", etc.\n- The transformation doesn't seem to be a simple inversion or rotation.\n- Possibly it's a pattern where some cells are \"increased\" by 1 if they are adjacent to a particular pattern?\n\nLet's compare line by line differences. The first two lines of input and output are identical:\nInput line 1: \"000000000000000000000000000000\". Output line 1: \"000000000000000000000000000000\". So first line is unchanged.\nLine 2: Input: \"000000000000000000000011110000\". Output: \"000000000000000000000011110000\". So still same.\nLine 3: Input: \"000000000000111110000011110000\". Output: \"000000000000111110000012210000\". So the difference: The output line 3: \"000000000000111110000012210000\". Compare to input: \"000000000000111110000011110000\". The difference is in substring \"011110\" vs \"012210\"? Let's align:\nInput: \"000000000000111110000011110000\"\nOutput: \"000000000000111110000012210000\"\nPositions: There is a \"111110\" appears in both. But then after that, input \"000011110000\", output \"000012210000\". So the block \"11110\" turned into \"12210\" maybe? Let's check more: line 4: Input \"000001110000111110000011110000\". Output \"000001110000122210000012210000\". So what happened: \"111110\" became \"122210\" I think. Let's see: Input line 4: \"000001110000111110000011110000\". Output line 4: \"000001110000122210000012210000\". So pattern: In the output, there is a replacement: \"111110\" replaced by \"122210\". And also \"011110\" replaced by \"012210\" maybe? Let me try to align columns: Possibly it's a transformation that takes \"1\" adjacent to a \"1\" and increases the digit to \"2\" if it is \"1\" in a pattern? Alternatively, maybe it's a \"salt-and-pepper\" transformation where digits are replaced based on neighboring digits to the left or right.\n\nWait, I'll look at the differences more systematically.\n\nObserving many similar patterns:\nIn example 1, there are multiple occurrences: \"111110\" becomes \"122210\" (line 4) and \"011110\" becomes \"012210\" (line 3) and \"111111\" becomes \"122211\" (line 5) maybe. Let's check \"111111\" in line 5: Input: \"000001111111112111111111110000\". Output: \"000001211111122211111112210000\". So what happened in that row? Let's align: Input: \"000001111111112111111111110000\"\nOutput: \"000001211111122211111112210000\"\nI see that the segment \"111111\" changed to \"122211\" maybe? Actually, let's break it: The output row (line 5) starts with \"000001\", then \"211111\", then \"122211\", then \"111112\", then \"210000\".\n\nLet's compare similar structure with line 4:\nLine 4: \"000001110000111110000011110000\" becomes \"000001110000122210000012210000\". \nBreak it: part1: \"000001110000\", then \"111110000\", then \"111110000\"? Actually, let me count: The row is 30 characters. I'll number positions:\nInput row 4: \"000001110000111110000011110000\"\nMaybe it's easier: The pattern \"111110\" seems to become \"122210\" consistently.\n\nAlso look at line 6: \"000001110000001000000000000000\" becomes \"000001210000001000000000000000\". So the \"111110\" part became \"122210\" in line 4, and in line 6 the \"011110\" part became \"012210\". So the transformation seems to add a 2 in the middle? Possibly the rule is: For any contiguous block of 1's of length 5? But not exactly: \"111111\" becomes \"122211\" on line 5. Let's check count: \"111111\" is 6 ones. And output becomes \"122211\". That pattern: the left two digits become \"12\", the middle two become \"22\", and the right two become \"11\". For \"111110\" (5 ones) becomes \"122210\". For \"011110\" (which is like one zero then five ones?) becomes \"012210\". Let me check: \"011110\" in output becomes \"012210\". That might be similar: It might be \"change 1 into 2 if it's surrounded by ones\" but then the ends become different.\n\nWait, let's try another approach: Look at the positions where digits changed from input to output. They seem to be only in certain positions. In example 1 there are few lines", "prompt_tokens": 1983, "completion_tokens": 2048}

And then a \"Test Input:\" is provided.\n\nWe are asked: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule.\" But the examples given are extremely long grids. Wait, let's check the provided examples:\n\nE.g. 1 Input: \n\"020002522052550225225502002000\n500522525002255225052000505502\n502288888885024444500233333002\n050588888882004444002033333020\n505088888882204444220233333505\n000588888882004444002233333002\n000255522000250520205052020552\n002255002050500022002000202000\n020200002020205200052052005200\n020200200025200200202000205050\n022211111222333333300777770050\n000211111050333333320777772555\n005211111520333333302777770252\n250211111200333333325777770000\n000200502220333333300777772022\n002005020205500205222205200220\n005200205000050002200005502005\n022088888020544444200200500020\n002088888225044444025011111202\n220088888500044444005511111500\n255088888050544444050211111000\n200088888000525002502211111000\n052552202002505005000011111000\n200025005520220055000502050025\n005000020550250002020050000005\n020205250520000005225200000550\n000550222002020052022000000200\n000200000000022022000052220005\n222000020550005020500050202225\n500225220000250205005550020005\"\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n\"843\n137\n841\"\n\nWe see that the input is given as a long string of digits without spaces? But then the output is three rows of 3 digits each. So maybe it's a grid transformation problem where the input grid is a square matrix of digits, and the output is a smaller grid.\n\nWait, check: E.g.1 Input: It's a string of digits with no spaces, but then the output \"843\" on first line, then \"137\", then \"841\". Possibly the transformation rule is: \"Given a square grid of digits, find the corners of the grid?\" But then the output numbers are from some extraction. But then E.g. 2 Input is similarly a long string of digits, and E.g. 2 Output is two rows \"319\" and \"641\" with 3 columns? Wait, no, check E.g.2 Output: \"319\" on first row, \"641\" on second row. So that output grid has 2 rows and 3 columns. E.g. 3 Output: \"848\", \"373\", \"284\". So that output grid is 3 rows, 3 columns.\n\nWhat transformation rule could be? They are ARC tasks usually which are pattern-based transformations. They might be \"shift\" the elements, \"rotate\", \"flip\" etc. Possibly the transformation rule might be: \"Take the input grid, then compute the sum of digits in each row, column, etc.\" But the outputs are 3-digit numbers with digits from 1 to 9 maybe? They are not sums because 8+4+3=15 which doesn't appear anywhere. Alternatively, the outputs might represent some pattern of differences.\n\nLet's analyze example 1 more. The output is: row1: 8, 4, 3; row2: 1, 3, 7; row3: 8, 4, 1.\nThat output grid is reminiscent of a magic square (8,1,6 is a magic square but here we see 8,4,3 and 1,3,7, 8,4,1). Are these magic squares? Actually, a standard magic square is 8,1,6 then 3,5,7 then 4,9,2. But these numbers do not match. But notice: The output numbers are single digits. They are small numbers, maybe they are counts. Possibly they represent the count of something from the input grid. The input grid is huge (maybe 25 rows x 25 columns?) Let's check E.g.1. It is a single line string of digits. Count digits: \"020002522052550225225502002000\" has length 44? Let's count: Actually, each line of input: E.g.1 Input is a single string with newlines? Actually, the text \"E.g. 1 Input:\" followed by multiple lines. But wait, how many lines are there? It appears to be 25 lines? Let's count: The provided text after \"E.g. 1 Input:\" doesn't have obvious line breaks in the given text?

We have multiple sample pairs, e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4. They are provided in textual form with examples input and output. The problem is: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" So our job: find transformation rule mapping input grid digits to output grid digits.\n\nWe have multiple examples. I need to carefully examine examples. Let's denote them as Example 1, Example 2, Example 3, Example 4. Then test input grid.\n\nObserving examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nRow by row:\nRow1: \"00000008888\"\nRow2: \"00000008008\"\nRow3: \"00888008888\"\nRow4: \"00808000000\"\nRow5: \"00888088800\"\nRow6: \"00000080800\"\nRow7: \"00000088800\"\nRow8: \"00000080800\"\nRow9: \"00000088800\"\n\nOutput:\nRow1: \"00000001111\"\nRow2: \"00000001001\"\nRow3: \"00111001111\"\nRow4: \"00101000000\"\nRow5: \"00111033300\"\nRow6: \"00000030300\"\nRow7: \"00000033300\"\nRow8: \"00000030300\"\nRow9: \"00000033300\"\n\nObserving pattern changes: \nMapping of digits: in input, digits appear: 0 and 8. In output, digits appear: 0, 1, 3. The digits: 8 becomes 1 or 3? But not exactly: in row1: input \"00000008888\" becomes \"00000001111\". So the block of 8's become 1's. But then row2: \"00000008008\" becomes \"00000001001\". So the left \"8\" became 1, right \"8\" became 1? But then row3: \"00888008888\" becomes \"00111001111\". Let's align columns:\n\nRow1: Input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8\n       Output: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 \nSo all contiguous block of 8's become 1's. But then row2: \"00000008008\" digits: positions: index0-5: 0, then index6: 8, then index7:0, then index8:0, then index9:8.\n   Output: \"00000001001\". So the first 8 becomes 1, and the last 8 becomes 1? But then row3: \"00888008888\": positions: index0: 0, index1:0, index2:8, index3:8, index4:8, index5:0, index6:0, index7:8, index8:8, index9:8, index10:8, index11:8.\n   Output: \"00111001111\": So: index0:0, index1:0, index2:1, index3:1, index4:1, index5:0, index6:1, index7:1, index8:1, index9:1, index10:1, index11:1.\n\nRow4: Input: \"00808000000\" becomes \"00101000000\": so the block \"8,0,8,0\" become \"1,0,1,0\"? So it seems that transformation is not simply mapping 8 -> 1, because row4: the 8's are replaced with 1's, but the 0 digits remain 0's? But then row5: Input: \"00888088800\" becomes \"00111033300\". Let's align:\nInput row5: digits: 0,0,8,8,8,0,8,8,8,0,0.\nOutput row5: digits: 0,0,1,1,1,0,3,3,3,0,0.\nSo here the block \"888\" in the beginning becomes \"111\", and then \"888\" in the middle becomes \"333\". So there's a difference: sometimes 8 becomes 1, sometimes 8 becomes 3.\n\nRow6: \"00000080800\" becomes \"00000030300\": That is, the \"8\" becomes 3?\nRow7: \"00000088800\" becomes \"00000033300\": \"888\" becomes \"333\".\nRow8: \"00000080800\" becomes \"00000030300\": \"8\" becomes 3.\nRow9: \"00000088800\" becomes \"00000033300\": \"888\" becomes \"333\".\n\nSo rule: Not all 8's become 1. Some become 1, some become 3, and sometimes 0 remain 0.\n\nLet's try to see pattern: Possibly transformation involves connectivity or counting of adjacent \"8\" groups? Possibly rule: find connected groups of 8's in the input (adjacent horizontally, vertically, diagonally?) and then assign a digit based on the group's position or some property.\n\nMaybe rule: There are two different patterns for the groups of 8's: ones that are \"outer\" (on border maybe?) become mapped to 1, and ones that are \"inner\" become mapped to 3? Let's check: Row1: \"00000008888\" is on the right border, becomes 1's. Row2: \"00000008008\": There are two groups: left group (just single 8 at col6) and right group (single 8 at col9). They both become 1. Row3: \"00888008888\": There are two groups: group1: \"888\" at col2-4 becomes 1's? But output row3: \"00111001111\". Let's check: Actually, row3's input: positions: 0,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8,8,8. There are two groups: group A: positions 2-4 and group B: positions 7-11. But output: group A becomes \"111\" and group B becomes \"111\" as well. So that can't differentiate.\n\nWait, row4: \"00808000000\": positions? Let's count: index0: 0, index1: 0, index2:8, index3:0, index4:8, index5:0, index6:0, index7:0, index8:0, index9:0, index10:0.\nOutput: \"00101000000\": mapping: index2: becomes 1, index4: becomes 1, rest 0. So groups are single 8's become 1's.\n\nThen row5: \"00888088800\": Now positions: group A: \"888\" at col2-4, group B: \"888\" at col7-9. But output: group A becomes \"111\", group B becomes \"333\". So why difference? Possibly because group B is adjacent to something else? Let's look at row6: \"00000080800\": single 8 becomes 3.\nRow7: \"00000088800\": group \"888\" becomes 3.\nRow8: \"00000080800\": single 8 becomes 3.\nRow9: \"00000088800\": group \"888\" becomes 3.\n\nMaybe the rule: The transformation involves two passes. Possibly the first pass identifies a \"frame\" or border of the pattern and transforms them to 1, and the second pass fills in the interior with 3. But row5 has two groups: left one becomes 1 and right one becomes 3. Row3: both groups become 1. Row2: both groups become 1. Row1: group becomes 1.\nRow4: groups become 1.\n\nSo what could cause one group to become 1 and the other 3? Possibly the left group is at the left side of a larger connected component. Let's try to see connectivity across rows? Let's lay out Example 1 grid as matrix with coordinates. I'll denote coordinates row, col, with row index from 0 to 8 and col index from 0 to 10. Let's mark 8's:\n\nRow0: columns 6-9 are 8's.\nRow1: col6=8, col9=8.\nRow2: col2,3,4 are 8's; col7-11 are 8's.\nRow3: col2=8, col4=8.\nRow4: col2,3,4 are 8's; col7,8,9 are 8's.\nRow5: col6=8.\nRow6: col2-4 are 8's.\nRow7: col6=8.\nRow8: col2-4 are 8's.\n\nLet's see connectivity if we consider 8's as connected if adjacent horizontally or vertically (maybe diagonally? Possibly not, but likely 8's connect in a pattern). Let's try to see clusters:\n\nCluster analysis:\n- The 8's at row0, col6-9, row1, col6 and row1, col9, row2, col2-4, row2, col7-11, row3, col2 and col4, row4, col2-4 and col7-9, row5, col6, row6, col2-4, row7", "prompt_tokens": 1118, "completion_tokens": 2048}

There are two examples provided plus the final test grid. We need to deduce the transformation rule from the examples, then apply rule to test input to produce final test output grid. We need to produce reasoning steps of maximum five steps in <thinking> block and then final output in <answer> block with final grid in JSON list of lists. The grid is 16x16? Actually look at examples: Each grid is 16 lines with 16 characters each. Actually the examples appear to be 16 rows each with 16 columns. Let me check the first example: It says \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then there are 16 lines each containing 16 characters? Actually count: \"000000000000000\" that's 16 zeros. So it's a 16x16 grid.\n\nLet's re-read the examples carefully.\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nLine by line:\n\nRow0: 000000000000000\nRow1: 010000000000000\nRow2: 000000000000000\nRow3: 000100000000000\nRow4: 000000000000000\nRow5: 000001000000000\nRow6: 000000000000000\nRow7: 000000000000000\nRow8: 000000000000000\nRow9: 000000000000000\nRow10: 000000000000000\nRow11: 000000000000000\nRow12: 000000000000000\nRow13: 000000000000000\nRow14: 000000000000000\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nRow0: 000000000000000\nRow1: 010000000000000\nRow2: 000000000000000\nRow3: 000100000000000\nRow4: 000000000000000\nRow5: 000001000000000\nRow6: 000000000000000\nRow7: 000000020000000\nRow8: 000000000000000\nRow9: 000000000200000\nRow10: 000000000000000\nRow11: 000000000002000\nRow12: 000000000000000\nRow13: 000000000000020\nRow14: 000000000000000\n\nWait check: Actually count rows: there are 15 lines in the examples input? Let's count: The first example input lines: \"000000000000000\" row0, \"010000000000000\" row1, \"000000000000000\" row2, \"000100000000000\" row3, \"000000000000000\" row4, \"000001000000000\" row5, \"000000000000000\" row6, \"000000000000000\" row7, \"000000000000000\" row8, \"000000000000000\" row9, \"000000000000000\" row10, \"000000000000000\" row11, \"000000000000000\" row12, \"000000000000000\" row13, \"000000000000000\" row14. So there are 15 rows. Similarly, output example E.g.1 has 15 rows. But wait, the prompt said \"16*16\" but then our examples are 15 rows? Let's count: Actually \"000000000000000\" is 16 columns, but number of digits if we count: \"0\" repeated 16 times equals length 16. But number of rows? They are actually 15 rows and not 16 rows. But then \"E.g. 2 Input\" lines: count them: \nRow0: 100000000000000\nRow1: 000000000000000\nRow2: 000000000000000\nRow3: 000000000000000\nRow4: 000010000000000\nRow5: 000000000000000\nRow6: 000000000000000\nRow7: 000000000000000\nRow8: 000000001000000\nRow9: 000000000000000\nRow10: 000000000000000\nRow11: 000000000000000\nRow12: 000000000000000\nRow13: 000000000000000\nRow14: 000000000000000\nSo again 15 rows.\n\nSo we have grids of dimension 15 rows x 16 columns. But then the provided test input has 15 rows? Let's count the test input lines: \nRow0: 100000000000000\nRow1: 000000000000000\nRow2: 000000000000000\nRow3: 000100000000000\nRow4: 000000000000000\nRow5: 000000000000000\nRow6: 000000100000000\nRow7: 000000000000000\nRow8: 000000000000000\nRow9: 000000000000000\nRow10: 000000000000000\nRow11: 000000000000000\nRow12: 000000000000000\nRow13: 000000000000000\nRow14: 000000000000000.\n\nYes, so it's same dimensions: 15 rows, 16 columns. The digits are '0' and '1' in the input, but the output digits are '0', '1', '2'? Because in E.g. 1 output, we see digits '2' appear. Similarly in E.g. 2 output, we see one row with \"000000000200000\" etc.\n\nLet's try to understand the transformation rule.\n\nObserving E.g. 1:\nInput grid: \nRow0: 000000000000000\nRow1: 010000000000000\nRow2: 000000000000000\nRow3: 000100000000000\nRow4: 000000000000000\nRow5: 000001000000000\nRow6: 000000000000000\nRow7: 000000000000000\nRow8: 000000000000000\nRow9: 000000000000000\nRow10: 000000000000000\nRow11: 000000000000000\nRow12: 000000000000000\nRow13: 000000000000000\nRow14: 000000000000000\n\nOutput grid:\nRow0: 000000000000000\nRow1: 010000000000000\nRow2: 000000000000000\nRow3: 000100000000000\nRow4: 000000000000000\nRow5: 000001000000000\nRow6: 000000000000000\nRow7: 000000020000000  <-- new digit '2'\nRow8: 000000000000000\nRow9: 000000000200000  <-- digit '2'\nRow10: 000000000000000\nRow11: 000000000002000  <-- digit '2'\nRow12: 000000000000000\nRow13: 000000000000020  <-- digit '2'\nRow14: 000000000000000\n\nLet's analyze: In the output, the first 6 rows are identical to input rows 0-5. Then row7 changed: originally row7 was \"000000000000000\", but output row7 is \"000000020000000\". So what's the difference? The difference is that there is a \"2\" inserted in column? Let's check positions: row7, col? It is \"000000020000000\". Counting columns from 0: 0,0,0,0,0,0, then a 2 at column6? Let's check: \"00000002\" would be 8 characters. Actually let's count carefully: \"000000020000000\". Count zeros: \"0000000\" is 7 zeros then \"2\" then \"000000\" is 6 zeros, total 7+1+6=14, but we need 16. Let's count exactly: \"000000020000000\" => It is 16 characters. Count manually: digits: indices: 0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:2, 8:0, 9:0, 10:0, 11:0, 12:0, 13:0, 14:0, 15:0? Actually \"000000020000000\" count zeros: if we count positions:\nPositions: \n0:0\n1:0\n2:0\n3:0\n4:0\n5:0\n6:0\n7:2\n8:0\n9:0\n10:0\n11:0\n12:0\n13:0\n14:0\n15:0? But that sums to 15 digits. Wait, we need 16 digits. Let me count properly: \"000000020000000\" - count characters: \n\"0000000\" would be 7 zeros, plus \"2\" is 1, plus \"0000000\" is 7 zeros, totals 15, but we need 16. Let's count: Actually count manually: The string \"000000020000000\" has 16 characters if I check: \"0000000\" is 7, then", "prompt_tokens": 857, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Actually looking at the numbers: Example 1: Input lines are 12 lines, each 12 digits, and output lines are 6 lines, each 6 digits. So transformation: 12x12 input grid becomes 6x6 output grid.\nExample 2: Input lines: count lines: There are 15 lines? Actually let's count: example2 input lines: There are \"0000100000000\" repeated multiple times. Count them: Actually, from text: \n```\n0000100000000\n0000100000000\n0000100300000\n0000100033000\n0000100030000\n0220100000000\n2220100000000\n0200100000000\n0000100000000\n1111111111111\n0000100000000\n0050100000000\n5550100808000\n0500100080000\n0000100800000\n```\nSo 15 lines, each line length? They appear to be 13 digits maybe? Count digits: \"0000100000000\" is 13 digits. And output: Each line: \"022300\" is 6 digits. So transformation: input 15x13 becomes output 6x6? Wait, check: \"022300\" length=6, but \"222033\" also length=6, etc.\nWait, check: \n022300: digits count: \"0\", \"2\", \"2\", \"3\", \"0\", \"0\" => 6 digits. And \"222033\" is also 6 digits.\nThus transformation seems to be: take input grid, which is 12x12, 15x13, etc, and output is 6x6 in examples. So the transformation rule seems to be \"downsample\" or \"compress\" the grid in some manner.\n\nLet's check differences: For example 1, input is 12x12, output is 6x6. For example 2, input is 15x13, output is 6x6. For example 3, input is 16x11, output is 6x6. So the rule is not simply halving dimensions but maybe compressing along vertical and horizontal directions, but not exactly halving?\n\nLet's try to see pattern in coordinates: In example1, input grid of size 12x12. Output grid is 6 rows. That suggests maybe we are dividing the input grid into 2x2 blocks? But 12/2=6, so that's plausible. Similarly, columns: 12/2=6. So in example 1, rule might be: Partition input grid into 2x2 blocks, and then for each block, apply transformation rule to get one output digit from that block. But then how to get a 6-digit number? But wait, check: Each block is 2x2, so there are 6 blocks vertically and 6 blocks horizontally, so each block becomes one output digit. But then the output is a grid of digits, each representing the transformation of a 2x2 block. But what is the transformation? Let's look at block positions.\n\nFor example 1, output first row \"110033\". Let's try to reconstruct: The input grid is 12x12. Let's index rows 0 to 11, columns 0 to 11. Partition into 2x2 blocks: block in row i=0..5, col j=0..5. Actually, careful: 12 rows divided by 2 gives 6 blocks vertically, 12 columns divided by 2 gives 6 blocks horizontally. So each block is (2 rows x 2 columns) and each block is mapped to a digit.\n\nBut then how do we combine the digits? Possibly by reading blocks row by row. So output cell (r, c) corresponds to input block starting at (2r, 2c), i.e., rows 2r and 2r+1, columns 2c and 2c+1.\n\nNow, what transformation rule on blocks? Let's denote a block as a 2x2 matrix of digits. They are digits 0-9. And the output digit is maybe the \"sum\" of the block's digits? But check: For example 1, first block at top-left? Let's check block coordinates: block (0,0) from input: rows 0 and 1, columns 0 and 1. \nRow0: \"0011000200033\", first two digits: \"00\"? Actually, careful: The input line \"0011000200033\" digits: indices: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:1,4:0,5:0,6:2,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:3,11:3? Let's re-read example 1 input lines carefully: There are 12 lines, each 12 digits.\n\nLet me re-read example1 input lines:\nLine1: 0011000200033 \nLine2: 0001000200330\nLine3: 0001100200030\nLine4: 2222222222222\nLine5: 0000000200000\nLine6: 0000000200000\nLine7: 0000000200000\nLine8: 0040000200000\nLine9: 0404000205500\nLine10:0040000200500\nLine11:0000000200050\nLine12:0000000200000\n\nBut wait: The provided example 1 input grid seems inconsistent: The first line \"0011000200033\" has 13 digits? Let's count: \"0011000200033\": digits: 0,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,3? Actually, I need to count: \"0011000200033\" count digits: 0,0,1,1,0,0,2,0,0,0,3,3,? Actually, count carefully:\n\"0011000200033\"\nWe can count by pairs: \"00 11 00 20 00 33\" which gives 6 pairs = 12 digits. So yes, it's 12 digits. And second line \"0001000200330\": pairs \"00 01 00 20 33 30\" = 12 digits. So grid is 12x12.\n\nNow, block (0,0) covers rows 0 and 1, columns 0 and 1. Let's extract these digits:\nRow0 col0: '0', row0 col1: '0'\nRow1 col0: '0', row1 col1: '0'\nSo block is [[0,0],[0,0]].\nThe output corresponding to block (0,0) should be the first digit of the first output row: \"1\". But our block sum is 0. Maybe it's not sum, maybe it's difference?\nMaybe it's count of a particular digit? For instance, count of \"1\" digits? In block, count of \"1\" is 0. But output is \"1\". So not count of ones.\n\nMaybe it's the maximum digit in block? That is 0. Not 1.\nMaybe it's the minimum digit? That is", "prompt_tokens": 801, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The problem is \"Abstraction and Reasoning\" from the ARC challenge. We need to deduce the transformation rule from provided examples. Let's re-read the input and output examples.\n\nWe have three examples of transformations. They are given in text as \"E.g. 1 Input\", \"E.g. 1 Output\", etc. The output grids and input grids are provided as 10 lines each, each line is 10 characters, which represent a grid of digits. Each example is a transformation rule mapping input to output. The transformation rule seems to be applied to each grid separately. We need to deduce the rule.\n\nLet's denote each row with indices from row0 to row9. Let's list the examples.\n\nLet's denote digits as characters. However, note that grid numbers are digits. But transformation might be something like \"rotate\", \"flip\", \"rearrange\", \"sort\", \"mirror\", etc.\n\nI need to compare examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nRow0: \"4200000000\"\nRow1: \"3700004000\"\nRow2: \"0000034400\"\nRow3: \"0000032400\"\nRow4: \"0007732400\"\nRow5: \"0007332000\"\nRow6: \"0007002200\"\nRow7: \"0007700000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nOutput:\nRow0: \"4200000000\"\nRow1: \"3700002000\"\nRow2: \"0000072200\"\nRow3: \"0000074200\"\nRow4: \"0003374200\"\nRow5: \"0003774000\"\nRow6: \"0003004400\"\nRow7: \"0003300000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nObservations:\n- The top row remains the same.\n- Row1: \"3700004000\" -> becomes \"3700002000\". The only difference is the digit \"4\" becomes \"2\"? Actually check row1: input \"3700004000\", output \"3700002000\". Compare positions: The first three digits \"370\" remain same, then \"0000\", then a digit \"4\" replaced by \"2\" then \"000\". So there's change in the digit at position 7 (0-indexed from left, but row is 10 digits, index 7 digit?) Actually check: row1: \nIndices: 0:3,1:7,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:4,8:0,9:0.\nOutput row1: 0:3,1:7,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:2,8:0,9:0.\nSo difference at index7: originally 4 became 2. \nRow2: \"0000034400\" -> \"0000072200\"\nMapping: input row2 digits: indices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:3,6:4,7:4,8:0,9:0. Output row2: \"0000072200\": digits: 0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,2,0. Wait, let's re-read: \"0000072200\" is 10 digits: index0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:7,7:2,8:2,9:0.\nSo row2 changed. Possibly the transformation involves swapping columns? Let's check row3: \"0000032400\" -> \"0000074200\": Compare: row3 input: digits: 0,0,0,0,0,3,2,4,0,0; output: 0,0,0,0,0,7,4,2,0,0. So row3: the digit at index6 becomes 7 and index7 becomes 4, compared to row2: originally index6 was 4, index7 was 4? Actually, row2 originally: index5:3, index6:4, index7:4. And row3 originally: index5:3, index6:2, index7:4. Then output row2: index6 becomes 7, index7 becomes 2, index8 becomes 2? Not sure.\n\nLet's double-check each row: The transformation appears to be non-trivial. Perhaps it's a \"diagonal reflection\" or \"vertical/horizontal mirror\" of some submatrix? Let's check rows 4 and 5:\nRow4 input: \"0007732400\", output: \"0003374200\". Compare digits: row4 input: digits: \"0,0,0,7,7,3,2,4,0,0\" and output: \"0,0,0,3,3,7,4,2,0,0\". So what changed? It seems that the digits from positions 3-5 maybe swapped: 7,7,3 become 3,3,7 in the output. \nRow5 input: \"0007332000\" becomes output: \"0003774000\". Compare: input: \"0,0,0,7,3,3,2,0,0,0\" and output: \"0,0,0,3,7,7,4,0,0,0\". So again, digits in positions: 3,4,5 become 3,7,7 in output vs 7,3,3 in input, with a swap of first two and then a 7 vs 2 difference?\nRow6 input: \"0007002200\" -> output: \"0003004400\". Compare: input: \"0,0,0,7,0,0,2,2,0,0\" and output: \"0,0,0,3,0,0,4,4,0,0\". So the digit at index3 changed from 7 to 3, and digits at index6 and index7 changed from 2 and 2 to 4 and 4.\nRow7 input: \"0007700000\" -> output: \"0003300000\". Compare: input: \"0,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,0,0\" and output: \"0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,0\". So the two 7's at indices 3 and 4 become 3,3 respectively.\nRow8 remains same.\nRow9 remains same.\n\nMaybe transformation is something like \"digit complement\" relative to 7? Because 7 becomes 3, 4 becomes 2, and maybe 2 becomes 4, 3 becomes 7. Let's check: row1: digit 4 became 2. Row4: digits 7,7,3 became 3,3,7. So it seems like a swapping: 7 and 3 swap places, and also 4 and 2 swap places. Row2: originally had digits: 3,4,4. In output row2, we get 7,2,2. That means 3 became 7? But wait, 3 became 7? Let's re-check row2: input row2: ... oh, wait row2: \"0000034400\". Index: 5:3, index6:4, index7:4. Output row2: \"0000072200\". Index: 5:0? Wait, let's re-read row2:\nInput row2: \"0000034400\" \nIndices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:3,6:4,7:4,8:0,9:0.\nOutput row2: \"0000072200\":\nIndices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0? Wait, \"0000072200\" I must carefully split into digits: it's \"0 0 0 0 0 7 2 2 0 0\" because there are 10 digits. But if I count: \"00000\" then \"7\" then \"22\" then \"00\". So index0=0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=0, index4=0, index5=7, index6=2, index7=2, index8=0, index9=0.\nSo row2: input digit at index5 is 3, but output digit at index5 is 7. And input digits at index6 and index7 are 4 and 4, output digits become 2 and 2. So indeed, transformation: 3 -> 7 and 4 -> 2, but wait row3: input row3: \"0000032400\", output row3: \"0000074200\". Let's check: indices: input row3: digits: index5:3, index6:2, index7:4. Output row3: index5:7, index6:4, index7:2. So transformation: 3 -> 7, 2 -> ? But 2 became 4? In row2, 4 became", "prompt_tokens": 771, "completion_tokens": 2048}

There are three examples, e.g. 1, e.g. 2, e.g. 3. The provided text includes sample input grids and corresponding outputs. We need to find transformation rule. Let me restate examples:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n\"6242\n2266\n6424\"\nOutput:\n\"42466424\n66222266\n24266242\n24266242\n66222266\n42466424\"\n\nObserving E.g. 1: The input grid is 3 rows of 4 digits. The output grid is 6 rows of 8 digits. So transformation: It seems the output is a bigger grid that is symmetric vertically and horizontally. Let's check pattern: The output grid seems to be a reflection of the input grid in some manner. Possibly the transformation might be: Take the input grid, and then duplicate it horizontally and vertically, and then swap some digits? Let's see: In E.g. 1, input grid:\nRow1: 6 2 4 2\nRow2: 2 2 6 6\nRow3: 6 4 2 4\nOutput grid rows:\nRow1 output: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\nRow2 output: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\nRow3 output: 2 4 2 6 6 4 2 4\nRow4 output: 2 4 2 6 6 4 2 4\nRow5 output: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\nRow6 output: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\n\nSo look at structure: The output grid is symmetric about center horizontally and vertically. And possibly the transformation rule is: given a square grid (or rectangular grid) input, first reflect it horizontally and vertically to form a larger grid. But what about digits? They are not simply copied - they seem to be inverted in some way.\n\nLet's check: The leftmost digit in output row1 is 4, which is the mirror of the rightmost digit in input row1? Actually, input row1: 6,2,4,2. Mirror horizontally: 2,4,2,6. And the output row1: 4,2,4,6,6,4,2,4. How to get that? Possibly the output grid is created by taking the input grid, rotating it 180 degrees, and then reflecting it?\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: Given an input grid, the output grid is constructed as follows: \n- For every cell in the input grid, generate a 2x2 block in the output grid. \n- The top-left cell of the block is the input cell value, the top-right cell is the input cell value that is \"inverted\" digit? But not sure.\n\nLet's try to see pattern in E.g.1. Look at the output grid: It is 6x8. Possibly consider dividing output grid into four quadrants of 3x4 each. The top left quadrant is:\nRow1-3, col1-4:\nRow1: 4 2 4 6\nRow2: 6 6 2 2\nRow3: 2 4 2 6\n\nCompare that with input grid, row1: 6 2 4 2, row2: 2 2 6 6, row3: 6 4 2 4.\nThey are not equal. But if we reverse each row of the input, we get:\nRow1 reversed: 2,4,2,6 -> that matches top-left quadrant row1.\nRow2 reversed: 6,6,2,2 -> top-left quadrant row2\nRow3 reversed: 4,2,6,4? Wait check: row3 reversed: 4,2,6,? Actually input row3 is 6,4,2,4. Reversed: 4,2,4,6. That equals row3 top-left quadrant. So top-left quadrant is the horizontal reflection of the input grid. Similarly, the bottom-right quadrant is 4,2,4,6; 6,6,2,2; 2,4,2,6. Which is again same as top-left quadrant and equals the horizontal reflection of the input. The top-right quadrant is:\nRow1: 6 6 4 2\nRow2: 2 2 6 6\nRow3: 6 6 4 2\nAnd the bottom-left quadrant is:\nRow4: 2 4 2 6\nRow5: 6 6 2 2\nRow6: 4 2 4 6\n\nWait check: Actually output grid is 6x8. Let's partition into quadrants: The grid is symmetric about center, so top half is rows 1-3, bottom half is rows 4-6. Now, the left half is columns 1-4, right half is columns 5-8.\nTop left quadrant: rows 1-3, columns 1-4: that equals input grid reversed horizontally? Actually, row1: 4,2,4,6 equals reverse of input row1 (which is 2,4,2,6)? Actually, let's check: input row1: 6,2,4,2 reversed is 2,4,2,6, but top-left quadrant row1 is 4,2,4,6. Hmm, that doesn't match. Let's re-read output row1: \"42466424\". It is 8 digits. What if we split it into two halves: first half \"4246\", second half \"6424\". The first half, \"4246\", is not equal to the input row \"6242\" reversed (which would be \"2426\")? Actually, let me try re-read the examples carefully.\n\nE.g. 1: Input: \nRow1: 6 2 4 2\nRow2: 2 2 6 6\nRow3: 6 4 2 4\nOutput: \nRow1: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\nRow2: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\nRow3: 2 4 2 6 6 4 2 4\nRow4: 2 4 2 6 6 4 2 4\nRow5: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\nRow6: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\n\nObserving symmetry: The output grid is symmetric with respect to both horizontal and vertical axes. It is like a square with mirror reflections. And the pattern of digits: 4,2,4,6 appear. Possibly the rule is: \"Replace each digit d in the input with (10-d)?\" Because if input digit 6 becomes 4, 2 becomes 8? Let's test: In E.g.1, input digits: 6,2,4,2. The output digits: 4,2,4,6. That is like swapping 6 and 4, while 2 and 8 might be swapped? But wait, let's check: For row1, input 6 becomes output 4, input 2 becomes output 2, input 4 becomes output 4, input 2 becomes output 6. That is odd: 6 -> 4, 2 -> ? Actually, 6 -> 4, 2 ->? Let's see row2: input row2: 2,2,6,6. Output row2: 6,6,2,2. So it seems that 6 becomes 2 and 2 becomes 6. Also row3: input row3: 6,4,2,4, output row3: 2,4,6,4. So it appears that the digits 6 and 2 are swapped; and 4 stays the same. But then what about 8? In E.g.2, input digits: 5,5,9,9 etc. Let's check E.g.2: \nInput:\nRow1: 5,5,9,9\nRow2: 9,5,5,5? Wait re-read: Provided \"5599\\n9555\\n5757\". Wait carefully: E.g. 2 Input:\n5599\n9555\n5757\nSo row1: 5 5 9 9, row2: 9 5 5 5, row3: 5 7 5 7. Output:\nRow1: 7 5 5 7 5 5 7 5? Let's re-read e.g.2 output: \"75755757\n55599555\n99555599\n99555599\n55599555\n75755757\". So row1 output: 7,5,5,7,5,5,7,5. Compare row1 input: 5,5,9,9. So pattern: 5 becomes 7? But then 9 becomes ? Actually, row1: 5->? Let's check row2 of output: \"55599555\". Compare input row2: \"9555\". There is doubling. Possibly rule: \nLet's try to break down structure.

Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" The problem description says: \"The user will provide several pairs of example input grids and their corresponding output grids. They represent a hidden transformation rule. Finally, a single test input grid is provided. Your goal is to deduce the rule from the examples and apply it to the test input grid to produce the correct test output grid.\"\n\nAnd then examples: There are four examples (E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, E.g. 4) with input grids and output grids. And then \"Test Input\" is provided. We need to deduce transformation rule.\n\nLet's parse details. We have four examples. Each example is a pair: \"E.g.1 Input\" and \"E.g.1 Output\", and similarly for others.\n\nWe are given text lines for each. Let's re-read the examples:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n0220\n2000\n0202\n2222\n0020\n0022\n7777\n0660\n0000\n6666\n6606\n0666\n0060\nE.g. 1 Output:\n8008\n0888\n0000\n0000\n8000\n8800\n\nObservation: The \"E.g. 1\" input grid seems to be a set of rows. But how many rows? Let's count them:\nE.g.1 Input lines: \nLine1: \"0220\"\nLine2: \"2000\"\nLine3: \"0202\"\nLine4: \"2222\"\nLine5: \"0020\"\nLine6: \"0022\"\nLine7: \"7777\"\nLine8: \"0660\"\nLine9: \"0000\"\nLine10: \"6666\"\nLine11: \"6606\"\nLine12: \"0666\"\nLine13: \"0060\"\n\nSo input grid has 13 rows? But output grid E.g.1 is:\nLine1: \"8008\"\nLine2: \"0888\"\nLine3: \"0000\"\nLine4: \"0000\"\nLine5: \"8000\"\nLine6: \"8800\"\n\nThat is 6 rows. So transformation: The input has 13 rows, and output has 6 rows. Possibly the transformation rule is to extract some sub-grids? It might be that the transformation rule takes the input grid and divides it into pieces, e.g. maybe the first part of the grid is the \"pattern\" region and the second part is the \"color\" region? But wait, let's check E.g. 1: There is a row \"7777\" in the input (line7). And in outputs, we see rows \"0000\", \"0000\", etc. There is also \"0660\" etc.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule involves \"mirroring\", \"flipping\", \"rotating\", \"overlaying\" etc.\n\nI see numbers: The input digits are 0,2,6,7,8 maybe? The outputs contain 0,8. And in some cases, output digits 0 and 8 are used. Also sometimes \"0888\", \"8008\", \"8800\", \"0888\", \"0080\", \"0008\". They are similar to patterns in the \"staircase\" problems? Possibly the transformation rule is something like: take the input grid, find the border of nonzero digits, then fill some border with 8's, and the interior with 0's? But then why would the input \"7777\" become \"0000\" sometimes? Not exactly.\n\nLet's look at each example more carefully:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput grid:\nRow indices: Let me denote rows:\nRow0: 0 2 2 0\nRow1: 2 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 2 0 2\nRow3: 2 2 2 2\nRow4: 0 0 2 0\nRow5: 0 0 2 2\nRow6: 7 7 7 7\nRow7: 0 6 6 0\nRow8: 0 0 0 0\nRow9: 6 6 6 6\nRow10: 6 6 0 6\nRow11: 0 6 6 6\nRow12: 0 0 6 0\n\nOutput grid E.g. 1:\nRow0: 8 0 0 8\nRow1: 0 8 8 8\nRow2: 0 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 8 0 0 0\nRow5: 8 8 0 0\n\nObservations: The output grid is 6 rows by 4 columns. It seems like a transformation that takes a 4x4 region from the input and modifies it somehow? But there are 13 rows in input, but output has 6 rows. Possibly the rule divides the input into two parts: The lower part (maybe rows 7 to 12?) and the top part? Let's check: In the input, row indices 7 to 12 are:\nRow7: 7777\nRow8: 0660\nRow9: 0000\nRow10: 6666\nRow11: 6606\nRow12: 0666\n\nMaybe the output is produced from combining some parts. But then the output rows \"8008\", \"0888\", \"0000\", \"0000\", \"8000\", \"8800\" are 6 rows. They might correspond to two halves: top half and bottom half. Possibly the transformation rule is to take the top half of the input grid and some other region? But then E.g. 1 output grid is 6 rows, but input grid is 13 rows. In E.g. 2, input grid:\nE.g. 2 Input:\n2202\n2022\n2200\n0202\n0220\n2002\n7777\n6066\n0600\n0000\n0006\n6600\n6060\nSo input has 13 rows. Output E.g.2:\n0000\n0000\n0088\n8080\n0008\n0800\nSo output is 6 rows same as before.\n\nE.g. 3 Input:\n0002\n2000\n0222\n0002\n2020\n0220\n7777\n6066\n6006\n0666\n6000\n6006\n0060\nE.g. 3 Output:\n0800\n0880\n8000\n0880\n0800\n8008\n\nE.g. 4 Input:\n2200\n0220\n2200\n2000\n0002\n2200\n7777\n6666\n6066\n6600\n0000\n6600\n0060\nE.g. 4 Output:\n0000\n0000\n0088\n0888\n0080\n0008\n\nTest Input:\n0002\n0220\n2002\n0220\n2022\n0002\n7777\n6606\n6660\n0000\n6606\n6060\n0066\n\nObserving the structure: Each example input has 13 rows. The output always has 6 rows. The top 6 rows of the input seem to be 6 rows, and bottom 7 rows of input, maybe? Wait, check: In E.g.1, input rows count: There are 13 rows. The output has 6 rows. Possibly the transformation rule takes the top 6 rows of the input and applies some transformation to produce the top 3 rows of output, and bottom 7 rows produce bottom 3 rows? But then in E.g.1, top 6 rows of input are:\nRow0: 0220\nRow1: 2000\nRow2: 0202\nRow3: 2222\nRow4: 0020\nRow5: 0022\nBottom 7 rows of input are:\nRow6: 7777\nRow7: 0660\nRow8: 0000\nRow9: 6666\nRow10: 6606\nRow11: 0666\nRow12: 0060\nBut output E.g.1 is 6 rows. How to split 6 rows output? Possibly the transformation rule takes the top 6 rows and then rotates them 90 degrees and then overlays them with something? Let's check differences between input and output:\n\nIn E.g.1, output row0: 8008. Input row? Possibly from combining row? Look at pattern: \"8008\" if we split as corners 8 and middle zeros? \"0888\" row1: maybe mirror pattern horizontally? \"0000\" row2, \"0000\" row3, \"8000\" row4, \"8800\" row5.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is something like: \"Place 8's in positions corresponding to the outer border of the shape that is formed by combining two parts of the grid.\" Idea: There are two distinct regions in the input grid: one region that's possibly \"the pattern\" and one region that's \"the background\". The digits in the input are 0,2,6,7,8. In output, only 0 and 8 appear. Possibly rule: if a cell in input is nonzero, then in output it becomes 8, except if it is in a certain region then 0. But then in E.g.1, row0: input", "prompt_tokens": 702, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Compare input vs output. Let's check row 1. Row1, input: \"00000001000000222200\" output same. Row2: input: \"00000000000000222200\", output: \"00000001000000222200\" so a difference: position 7 changed from 0 to 1. Also row3: input \"00000022222000222200\", output \"00000011111000222200\" so the \"22222\" becomes \"11111\"? Let's see: row3: positions? Let's index columns: \"000000\" (cols1-6), then \"22222\" would be col7-11, then \"0\" col12? Actually, let's count digits: \nRow3: \"00000022222000222200\". Count: 6 zeros, then \"22222\" (5 digits) then \"0\" then \"002222\" (1+5) then \"00\"? Wait, let me recalc exactly:\nRow3: \"00000022222000222200\". Count length: there are 20 digits (since row1 is 20 digits). So: col1-6: 0, col7-11: 2, col12: 2? Wait, let's re-read row3: \"00000022222000222200\". Actually, we see somewhere at col7 there's 2? Let's re-read the row carefully:\nLooking at row3, maybe I should count characters:\n\"00000022222000222200\"\nIndices: \n0: 0\n1: 0\n2: 0\n3: 0\n4: 0\n5: 0\n6: 2\n7: 2\n8: 2\n9: 2\n10: 2\n11: 0\n12: 0\n13: 0\n14: 2\n15: 2\n16: 2\n17: 2\n18: 2\n19: 0\n20: 0? Actually, count digits carefully: The string \"00000022222000222200\" should have length 20, but let me count properly: It appears there are 6 zeros, then \"22222\" (5 digits) then \"0\" (1 digit) then \"002222\" (1 zero then 5 twos) then \"00\" (2 zeros) total =6+5+1+6+2 =20. So the transformation: The \"22222\" group becomes \"11111\" in row3. And row4: \"00000022222000000000\" becomes \"00000011111000000000\". So whenever we have consecutive 2's, they become 1's. But not always? Let's check row8: input \"00222200000000000000\" becomes \"00111101000000000000\". So originally row8: \"00222200000000000000\". Count: index 1:0, index2:0, then \"22222\" from index3-7, then zeros. But output: \"00111101000000000000\". So what happened? The \"22222\" got changed to \"11111\", and also the digit preceding it maybe got changed from 0 to 1? Let's check: row8: input \"00222200000000000000\", output \"00111101000000000000\". Wait, check positions:\nInput row8: digits: index0:0, index1:0, index2:2, index3:2, index4:2, index5:2, index6:2, then rest zeros.\nOutput row8: \"00111101000000000000\". That is: index0:0, index1:0, index2:1, index3:1, index4:1, index5:1, index6:1, then index7:0, index8:1? Wait, let's count: \"00111101000000000000\" length=20:\nIndices: 0:0, 1:0, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:0, 8:1, then zeros. But wait, row8 input didn't have a \"1\" at index7 originally? It had \"22222\" from index2 to index6. So transformation: maybe pattern: Look at the contiguous block \"22222\" becomes \"11111\" and then also add a \"1\" to its left neighbor if it is 0? But row2: input \"00000000000000222200\" becomes \"00000001000000222200\". In row2, the block \"22222\" is at the end, and the cell immediately to left of that block (col12) becomes 1? Let's check row2: input \"00000000000000222200\", output \"00000001000000222200\". So the difference is at col? Let's check positions: In row2, the \"22222\" block is at the end maybe? Wait, need to identify pattern: In E.g. 1, where are the differences? Compare row1: no difference. Row2: output has a 1 in position 7 that wasn't in input.\nRow3: block \"22222\" turned into \"11111\"\nRow4: same pattern: block \"22222\" becomes \"11111\"\nRow5: block \"22222\" becomes \"11111\"\nRow6: block \"22222\" becomes \"11111\"\nRow7: no pattern? row7: input \"00000000000000000000\" becomes \"00000001000000000000\". So row7 got a 1 inserted at column? Let's check row7: output \"00000001000000000000\": meaning digit 7 becomes 1.\nRow8: input \"00222200000000000000\" becomes \"00111101000000000000\". What changed? The block \"22222\" becomes \"11111\" and also there is an extra 1 inserted at index? Let's check indices: input row8: \"00222200000000000000\". Which columns? Possibly columns: index0:0, index1:0, index2:2, index3:2, index4:2, index5:2, index6:2, then rest zeros. Output: \"00111101000000000000\". Compare digit by digit:\nOutput: index0:0, index1:0, index2:1, index3:1, index4:1, index5:1, index6:1, index7:0, index8:1, then zeros. So what changed? The \"22222\" block became \"111", "prompt_tokens": 1287, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Wait, check input row2: \"0200000000000\". Actually, it is \"0200000000000\" with a \"2\" at col? Let's examine: \"0200000000000\" - It is 13 digits. Index digits: col0=0, col1=2, col2=0,... So there is 2 at col1.\nRow6 input: \"0000000000400\" so 4 at col? Let's count: \"0000000000400\" digits: col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=0, col4=0, col5=0, col6=0, col7=0, col8=0, col9=0, col10=4, col11=0, col12=0. So there's a 4 at col10.\nRow11 input: \"0003000000000\" so 3 at col? Counting: \"0003000000000\": col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=3, col4=0,... So there's a 3 at col3.\n\nIn output, row2 becomes \"0255555555500\". That row had a \"2\" at beginning \"0\", \"2\" at col1 remains? Actually row2 output: first two digits: 0 2 then 555555555500. So row2 has changed from 0200000000000 to 0255555555500.\nRow6 output: \"0005555555400\" changed from 0000000000400 to row6: now there is a \"5\" block inserted? Actually row6: \"0005555555400\". Compare input row6: \"0000000000400\", so originally there was a 4 at col10. Now row6: digit at col3 is 5? Actually, let's recalc: row6 output: digits: col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=5, col4=5, col5=5, col6=5, col7=5, col8=5, col9=5, col10=5, col11=4, col12=0.\nRow11 output: \"0003000000000\" remains unchanged.\nAlso row3 becomes \"0000000000500\" from input row3 which was all zeros, so addition of a \"5\" block? Also row4 becomes \"0000000000500\", row5 \"0000000000500\", row7 \"0005000000000\", row8 \"0005000000000\", row9 \"0005000000000\", row10 \"0005000000000\". It seems numbers \"5\" appear in many rows, in blocks. And also \"4\" sometimes becomes \"5\", and then a sequence of \"5\" are inserted. There's also a \"0\" at the end sometimes.\n\nSo what is happening? Let's check positions of nonzero digits in input and output for each example.\n\nI suspect rule: There are two \"sources\" of transformation, perhaps \"2\", \"3\", \"4\" in input become \"sweeps\" of \"5\" that extend vertically/horizontally from their positions. Possibly the rule is: Given an input grid, identify the \"path\" that connects certain digits in a diagonal or vertical/horizontal manner, and fill the path with a specific number.\n\nI see e.g. in example 1, the digit 2 at row2 col1 becomes extended to row2: It remains \"2\" at leftmost and then a block of \"5\" following it? Actually, check row2 output: \"0255555555500\". It is 13 digits: digit0: 0, digit1: 2, then digits2-10: 5's? Let's count: \"0255555555500\": after the initial \"0\" and \"2\", then \"5555555555\" (that's 10 digits?) Actually count: string \"0255555555500\": length is 13. Let me count: '0' at index0, '2' at index1, then index2: '5', index3: '5', index4: '5', index5: '5', index6: '5', index7: '5', index8: '5', index9: '5', index10: '5', index11: '5', index12: '0'? Wait, no: \"0255555555500\" might be \"0\", \"2\", then \"55555555550\", then \"00\" at end? Let's check length: The output row \"0255555555500\" if we count digits: \n0: '0'\n1: '2'\n2: '5'\n3: '5'\n4: '5'\n5: '5'\n6: '5'\n7: '5'\n8: '5'\n9: '5'\n10: '5'\n11: '5'\n12: '0'\nBut there are two zeros at the end? Actually, \"0255555555500\" seems to have two zeros at the end. Wait, let's re-read the provided output exactly as given:\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n0000000000000\n0000000000000\n0255555555500\n0000000000500\n0000000000500\n0000000000500\n0005555555400\n0005000000000\n0005000000000\n0005000000000\n0005000000000\n0003000000000\n0000000000000\n\nSo row2: \"0255555555500\". Count length: Count characters: \"0\" then \"2\" then \"5555555555\" then \"00\"? Let's check: Possibly, the pattern: The digit 2 remains at its original column, and then a horizontal line of '5's extends from that column to the right edge? For row2, the 2 is at col1 originally and then from col2 to col11 become 5's? But output row2 is \"0255555555500\". That is 13 digits: index0:0, index1:2, index2:5, index3:5, index4:5, index5:5, index6:5, index7:5, index8:5, index9:5, index10:5, index11:5, index12:0. So that means the 5's fill indices 2 through 11. Notice that the original nonzero digit \"2\" was at col1. But then the contiguous block of 5's extends from col2 to col11. But then why is there a trailing 0 at col12? Possibly because the block stops before the last column. Alternatively, maybe the rule is: For each nonzero digit, consider a \"line\" from that digit to the border of the grid in a direction determined by the digit's value? \n\nLet's check: In row2, the nonzero digit is 2 at col1. In output, row2 becomes 0,2 then a horizontal line of 5's from col2 to col11, then 0 at col12. Similarly, row6 input had a 4 at col10. In output, row6 becomes \"0005555555400\". It has a 4 at col11 and a block of 5's from col3 to col10. Also row11 input had 3 at col3 (in \"0003000000000\"). In output, row11 is unchanged (\"0003000000000\"). So it seems that the nonzero digits that are not 3 remain untouched? But wait, row2 digit 2 changed to row2: \"0255555555500\". But row11 digit 3 remains same. Also row6 digit 4 becomes row6: \"000", "prompt_tokens": 1137, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Then we are given Test Input.\n\nI need to analyze the patterns and deduce the transformation rule.\n\nLet's denote examples:\n\nWe have 15 rows and 15 columns, as seen in examples. The digits are \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", etc. But note that digits in input are \"0\" and some numbers? Let's check Example 1:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nRow numbers: I'll index rows by 0 to 14. We have 15 rows. Each row is a string of 15 columns. They are composed of digits \"0\" and some digits \"6\", \"2\", \"8\"? Wait, check: The input given for e.g. 1 is:\n```\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000000060000\n000000000000000\n000020000000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000080000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n```\nWait, I need to check: Actually, the given e.g. 1 input starts with \"000000000000000\", then second row same, then third row \"000000000060000\"? Wait, but then there is \"000020000000000\" on the fifth row, and \"000000080000000\" on the 13th row. So there are three non-zero values: \"6\", \"2\", \"8\". And then the output for e.g.1 is:\n```\n666666666666666\n600000000000006\n666666666666666\n600000000000006\n222222222222222\n200000000000002\n200000000000002\n200000000000002\n800000000000008\n800000000000008\n800000000000008\n888888888888888\n800000000000008\n800000000000008\n888888888888888\n```\nObserving pattern: The output grid's numbers are 6,2,8, etc. They are transformed in a pattern. It seems that the output grid is a modification of the input grid by \"fattening\" the shapes around the single non-zero numbers? Possibly the rule is: For each contiguous region of same non-zero value, draw a border with that same number? Or maybe it's like \"fill to boundaries\" but then add a border? Let's analyze carefully.\n\nExample 1: Input has three points: \n- A \"6\" at row? Let's locate coordinates. The input grid is 15x15. Let's index rows 0 to 14, columns 0 to 14. Let's determine coordinates:\n\nE.g. 1 input:\nRow 0: \"000000000000000\" (all zeros)\nRow 1: \"000000000000000\"\nRow 2: \"000000000060000\" => so there's a \"6\" at column 11? Actually \"00000000006\" then \"000\"? Let's count: the string \"000000000060000\". Counting indices: there are 14 zeros before? Let's count: if row is \"00000000006\" then \"000\"? Wait, need to count carefully: It's 15 characters. I'll index columns 0 to 14.\nRow 2: characters: positions: indices 0-13 are zeros, then index 14 is \"0\"? Actually, let's recalc: \"000000000060000\" has \"0000000000\" then \"6\" then \"0000\"? Let's count: Actually I'll count: \"00000000006\" is 11 characters? Let's count: \"0000000000\" is 10 zeros, then \"6\" then \"0000\" is 4 zeros, so total 10+1+4 = 15. So the \"6\" is at column index 10 (if we start at 0, then 10th index is the 11th character) then followed by four zeros. Let me recalc: Actually, I'll use: \"0000000000\" (10 zeros) then \"6\" then \"0000\" (4 zeros). That means the \"6\" is at column index 10. But wait, check the digits: The string \"00000000006\" maybe I'm off. Let's count manually:\n\"00000000006\" has 11 characters if I remove trailing \"0000\"? I'm trying to decode: The provided string is \"000000000060000\". I can break it: maybe it's \"0000000000\" then \"6\" then \"0000\". That sums to 10+1+4 = 15. So yes, \"6\" is at column 10. \nNext, row 4: \"000020000000000\". That means a \"2\" at column index? \"000020000000000\" equals \"00002\" then \"000000000\"? Let's count: \"0000\" is 4 zeros, then \"2\", then \"000000000\" is 9 zeros, total 4+1+9 = 14, but we need 15 digits. Let's recalc: Actually, \"000020000000000\" length: count zeros: There are zeros at indices: 0,1,2,3, then index 4 is \"2\", then indices 5 to 13 are zeros, that is 9 zeros, then maybe index 14 is \"0\"? Actually recount: \"000020000000000\" if I count: characters: 0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. That sums to 15 digits. So \"2\" is at column index 4.\nThen row 12: \"000000080000000\". Count: \"0000000\" might be 7 zeros then \"8\" then \"0000000\" 7 zeros? That sums to 7+1+7 = 15, so \"8\" is at column index 7.\nSo input points:\n(2,10) with digit \"6\"\n(4,4) with digit \"2\"\n(12,7) with digit \"8\"\n\nNow look at output e.g. 1:\nRow 0: \"666666666666666\" (all 6's) \nRow 1: \"600000000000006\" (6 at ends, zeros in middle)\nRow 2: \"666666666666666\" (all 6's)\nRow 3: \"600000000000006\"\nRow 4: \"222222222222222\" (all 2's)\nRow 5: \"200000000000002\"\nRow 6: \"200000000000002\"\nRow 7: \"200000000000002\"\nRow 8: \"800000000000008\"\nRow 9: \"800000000000008\"\nRow 10: \"800000000000008\"\nRow 11: \"888888888888888\"\nRow 12: \"800000000000008\"\nRow 13: \"800000000000008\"\nRow 14: \"888888888888888\"\n\nObserving: The output grid seems to be a combination of \"filled\" areas that are like bounding boxes that have been \"extended\" by one cell around the original input points? But check: For the \"6\" point at (2,10) in input, the output has a block of \"6\" in rows 0-2? Actually, row 0 and row 1 and row 2 are filled with 6's. But wait, the output grid has region with 6's in rows 0-2 and columns 0-14. But then row 3 is \"600000000000006\". So it seems like the \"6\" region has been \"expanded\" to include a border around the original location? Let's try to see pattern: For point \"6\" at (2,10) in input, its minimum row is 2, maximum row is 2, but the output extends it to row 0 and row 1 as well. Actually, look at output: The top block of 6's is rows 0-2, and bottom border row of row 3 also has 6's at the ends. Similarly, for point \"2\" at (4,4), output has rows 4-7 filled with 2's? Actually, output: row 4 is all 2's, row 5-7 have 2's at the beginning and end. And then for the \"8\" at (12,7), output: rows 8-10 are partially 8's? Let's examine: Row 8: \"800000000000008\" has 8 at beginning and end; row 9 and 10 similar, then row 11 is all 8's and then row 12-13 have 8 at beginning and end, row 14 is all 8's? But wait, check row 11: \"888888888888888\" is all 8's, but input \"8\" is at (12,", "prompt_tokens": 1245, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Similarly for E.g. 2.\n\nLet's read them carefully:\n\nE.g. 1 Input grid lines:\n\"0000000000000\" (line 1)\n\"0000300000000\" (line 2)\n\"0020340000000\" (line 3)\n\"0021100000000\" (line 4)\n\"0020040000000\" (line 5)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 6)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 7)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 8)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 9)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 10)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 11)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 12)\n\"0088888800000\" (line 13)\n\"0088888800000\" (line 14)\n\"0000880000000\" (line 15)\n\"0000880000000\" (line 16)\n\"0000888888000\" (line 17)\n\"0000888888000\" (line 18)\n\"0088008800000\" (line 19)\n\"0088008800000\" (line 20)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 21)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 22)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 23)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 24)\n\nE.g. 1 Output grid lines:\n\"0000000000000\" (line 1)\n\"0000300000000\" (line 2)\n\"0020340000000\" (line 3)\n\"0021100000000\" (line 4)\n\"0020040000000\" (line 5)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 6)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 7)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 8)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 9)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 10)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 11)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 12)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 13)\n\"0022222200000\" (line 14)\n\"0022222200000\" (line 15)\n\"0000110000000\" (line 16)\n\"0000110000000\" (line 17)\n\"0000113333000\" (line 18)\n\"0000113333000\" (line 19)\n\"0044004400000\" (line 20)\n\"0044004400000\" (line 21)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 22)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 23)\n\"0000000000000\" (line 24)\n\nObservations: The transformation seems to involve differentiating some shapes maybe. Let's compare the input and output grids for e.g. 1.\n\nI see that the upper part of the grid from lines 1 to 12 remain unchanged? Let's check:\n- The first 4 lines: \nInput line1: \"0000000000000\", Output: \"0000000000000\" same.\nLine2: \"0000300000000\" -> unchanged.\nLine3: \"0020340000000\" -> unchanged.\nLine4: \"0021100000000\" -> unchanged.\nLine5: \"0020040000000\" -> unchanged.\nLine6: \"0000000000000\" -> unchanged.\nLine7: \"0000000000000\" unchanged.\nLine8: \"0000000000000\" unchanged.\nLine9: \"0000000000000\" unchanged.\nLine10: \"0000000000000\" unchanged.\nLine11: \"0000000000000\" unchanged.\nLine12: \"0000000000000\" unchanged.\n\nThen from line 13 onward, differences appear.\nInput line 13: \"0088888800000\"\nOutput line 13: \"0000000000000\"\nSo maybe the block from row 13 is erased? Let's check:\nLine 14: Input \"0088888800000\", Output \"0022222200000\". \nWait, discrepancy.\n\nLet's check rows with numbers:\nRow 13: Input \"0088888800000\", Output \"0000000000000\" (all zeros).\nRow 14: Input \"0088888800000\", Output \"0022222200000\".\nRow 15: \"0000880000000\" -> \"0000110000000\"\nRow 16: \"0000880000000\" -> \"0000110000000\"\nRow 17: \"0000888888000\" -> \"0000113333000\"\nRow 18: \"0000888888000\" -> \"0000113333000\"\nRow 19: \"0088008800000\" -> \"0044004400000\"\nRow 20: \"0088008800000\" -> \"0044004400000\"\nRow 21: \"0000000000000\" -> \"0000000000000\"\nRow 22: \"0000000000000\" -> \"0000000000000\"\nRow 23: \"0000000000000\" -> \"0000000000000\"\nRow 24: \"0000000000000\" -> \"0000000000000\"\n\nSo the transformation seems to occur in a contiguous block starting at row 13 through row 20. Let's annotate coordinates.\n\nLet me denote coordinates as (row, col). The grid is 24 rows by 12 columns.\nWe'll mark rows that are changed: rows 13 to 20.\n\nLet's examine each region in that block:\n\nIn E.g. 1, the input from row 13 to row 16 and row 17 to row 18 and row 19 to row 20.\nLet's list them with positions of non-zero digits:\n\nRow 13, Input: \"0088888800000\"\nThat means: col0:0, col1:0, col2:8, col3:8, col4:8, col5:8, col6:8, col7:8, col8:8, col9:8, col10:0, col11:0, col12:0, col13:0, col14:0, col15:0? Wait, careful: The string length: \"0088888800000\" is 14 characters? Actually count: it's \"0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\"? No, let's count: The grid lines in example 1 are \"0000000000000\" which is 14 zeros? Wait, re-read e.g. 1 input lines: There are 24 lines, each seems to be 14 characters long? Let's count first line \"0000000000000\": that's 13 zeros? Actually count carefully: \"0000000000000\" count digits: It looks like either 13 or 14 digits. Let\u2019s count digits: \n\"0000000000000\" -> It has 13 digits. Because \"0000000000000\" if we count: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Yes, 13 digits.\nSo each row is 13 columns. So coordinates: rows from 0 to 23, columns from 0 to 12.\n\nSo row 13 (0-indexed row 12 if start from 0, but I'll treat as given row numbers as provided, probably row index 13 etc. but I'll treat them as given order.)\nI should re-read E.g. 1 input grid lines, maybe I'll index them 1-indexed as given:\n\nRow1: \"0000000000000\" (13 digits)\nRow2: \"0000300000000\" (13 digits)\nRow3: \"0020340000000\"\nRow4: \"0021100000000\"\nRow5: \"0020040000000\"\nRow6: \"0000000000000\"\nRow7: \"0000000000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000000\"\nRow10: \"0000000000000\"\nRow11: \"0000000000000\"\nRow12: \"0000000000000\"\nRow13: \"0088888800000\"\nRow14: \"0088888800000\"\nRow15: \"0000880000000\"\nRow16: \"0000880000000\"\nRow17: \"0000888888000\"\nRow18: \"0000888888000\"\nRow19: \"0088008800000\"\nRow20: \"0088008800000\"\nRow21: \"0000000000000\"\nRow22: \"0000000000000\"\nRow23: \"0000000000000\"\nRow24: \"0000000000000\"\n\nAnd output similarly.\n\nNow, look at the region of interest in e.g. 1: rows 13 to 20. Let's mark columns. I'll re-check row 13 input: \"0088888800000\". Count digits: '", "prompt_tokens": 1075, "completion_tokens": 2048}

{"task_id": "11e1fe23", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus:free", "raw_response": "We are given transformation rules examples from ARC problems. We have two examples: Eg1 and Eg2, and then a test input.\n\nLet's restate examples:\n\nExample 1 input:\nLine 1: 000000000000 (maybe 12 characters)\nLine 2: 000200000100\nLine 3: 000000000000\nLine 4: 000000000000\nLine 5: 000000000000\nLine 6: 000000000000\nLine 7: 000000000000\nLine 8: 000300000000\nLine 9: 000000000000\nLine 10: 000000000000\n\nExample 1 Output:\nLine 1: 000000000000\nLine 2: 000200000100\nLine 3: 000000000000\nLine 4: 000002010000\nLine 5: 000000500000\nLine 6: 000003000000\nLine 7: 000000000000\nLine 8: 000300000000\nLine 9: 000000000000\nLine 10: 000000000000\n\nObservations: There are digits in the input that appear to be \"source values\", then the output grid seems to have rows that represent some transformation along a vertical dimension.\n\nLet's re-read the examples. In E.g. 1: Input grid is a 10x12 grid. There are digits in the input: \"2\", \"1\", \"3\" that appear in row2 col? Let's find coordinates:\n\nCoordinates: rows are enumerated 0-indexed? But in ARC tasks, grid is typically 2D with rows and columns. I'll denote row, column indices starting from top: row index 0 top.\n\nLet's list non-zero numbers in input for E.g. 1:\nRow0: \"000000000000\" -> all zeros.\nRow1: \"000200000100\" -> non-zero: digit '2' at col? Let's check: \"000200000100\", maybe splitting: row1: digits: 0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0? But wait, the string length is 12. So digits: index positions: index 0,1,2 are zero, index 3=2, index 4=0, index 5=0, index 6=0, index 7=0, index 8=0, index 9=1, index10=0, index11=0. So a '2' appears at row1, col3, and a '1' appears at row1, col9.\nRow2: all zeros.\nRow3: all zeros.\nRow4: all zeros.\nRow5: all zeros.\nRow6: all zeros.\nRow7: \"000300000000\" -> digit '3' at row7, col? \"000300000000\", so index digits: first three zeros, then digit '3' at index 3 maybe? Let's check: row7: \"000300000000\" -> indeed index 3 is '3'.\nRow8: all zeros.\nRow9: all zeros.\n\nNow look at output grid for E.g. 1.\nRow0: \"000000000000\" -> same as input row0.\nRow1: \"000200000100\" -> same as input row1.\nRow2: \"000000000000\" -> same as row2 input.\nRow3: \"000002010000\" -> new row. There is a '2' at col? Let's check row3: \"000002010000\" -> digits: index 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0, then index5:2, then index6:0, then index7:1, then index8:0, then index9:0, index10:0, index11:0. So row3 has digits: '2' at col5 and '1' at col7.\nRow4: \"000000500000\" -> row4: digit '5' at col? \"000000500000\" so index 6 is 5.\nRow5: \"000003000000\" -> row5: digit '3' at col? \"000003000000\": index? It is \"000003000000\", so index 6 is 3? Wait check: \"000003000000\": if digits: index0:0, index1:0, index2:0, index3:0, index4:0, index5:0, index6:3, index7:0, index8:0, index9:0, index10:0, index11:0? Actually, let me re-read: \"000003000000\" has a '3' at index 6? But wait, \"000003000000\" has 3 digits? Let's count carefully: \"000003000000\" is 12 characters. The first 6 digits: \"000003\" then \"000000\". So '3' is at index6 indeed? But then row4 had a '5' at col6. And row5 has a '3' at col6. But then row7 remains \"000300000000\" which is exactly the same as input row7? Wait, check row7 output: \"000300000000\", same as input row7. Row8: \"000000000000\", row9: \"000000000000\".\n\nObserving pattern: The outputs have same rows for row0, row1, row2, row7, row8, row9. But rows 3,4,5 are different. What happened? It seems that the transformation rule is: \"for each non-zero digit in the input, if it is not in the first two rows or last three rows, then create a vertical \"staircase\" pattern.\" Possibly the rule is: The input grid's non-zero digits are taken and are written vertically downward with increasing spacing? Let's check row1: \"000200000100\" had two digits: '2' and '1'. Then output row3 gets the '2' at col? Actually, wait, let me try to see: The output row3 \"000002010000\" seems to be \"2\" at col? Wait, check coordinates. Perhaps the transformation rule is: \"read each non-zero digit from the input grid and place it into a new location determined by the digit's value and relative vertical coordinate.\" But then output row4 \"000000500000\" includes digit '5'. And output row5 \"000003000000\" includes digit '3'. And output row7 remains unchanged from input row7 \"000300000000\". So the transformation rule might be: \"Shift the non-zero digits from their original positions to positions that are in the middle of the grid, following the order of the input rows.\" But then what is the transformation? Wait, look at E.g. 2.\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\nRow0: \"00000000000\" (10 columns)\nRow1: \"00000000000\"\nRow2: \"00000000000\"\nRow3: \"00000000200\" -> non-zero digits: there is '2' at some column? Let's check row3: \"00000000200\" is 10 characters, index? \"00000000200\": first 7 digits are zeros, then '2', then two zeros. Actually, wait, count: \"00000000200\": if length=10, then index0=0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=0, index4=0, index5=0, index6=2, index7=0, index8=0, index9=0? Actually, but then there is also a \"00\" at the end? Actually, string \"00000000200\" has 10 digits: 0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0 if I count? Let's count: \"00000000200\" has 11 characters? Wait, let's check: It says E.g. 2 Input: \"00000000000\" (line 1), \"00000000000\" (line 2), \"00000000000\" (line 3), \"00000000200\" (line 4), \"00000000000\" (line 5), \"00000000000\" (line 6), \"00000000000\" (line 7), \"00000000000\" (line 8), \"00000000000\" (line 9), \"00800000600\" (line 10), \"00000000000\" (line 11), \"00000000000\" (line 12). So grid size is 12x10.\nLet me list non-zero digits in E.g. 2 input:\nRow3: \"00000000200\" -> has a '2' at col? Let's count columns: There are 10 digits. They are: col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=0, col4=0, col5=0, col6=2, col7=0, col8=0, col9=0.\nRow10: \"00800000600\" -> non-zero digits: digit '8' at col? \"00800000600\": if indices: col0=0, col1=0, col2=8, col3=0, col4=0, col5=0, col6=0, col7=0, col8=6, col", "prompt_tokens": 699, "completion_tokens": 2048}

It appears that row4 gets the same as row3? But row3 is \"00600\". But row4 is \"00000\", so replacing with row3? But then row5 becomes \"04440\", which is row2? But row2 is \"54440\", not \"04440\". Wait check: row5 output is \"04440\"? Input row? Let's re-read: Actually, output row5: \"04440\". Compare to input row? Possibly row? Let's check differences: In row4, \"00000\" became \"00600\" which is exactly row3 (which is \"00600\"). And row5 changed from \"00000\" to \"04440\". But row3 is \"00600\", row2 is \"54440\". \"04440\" looks like row? Possibly it's a combination or maybe it's a mirror of row? Let me re-read the example again carefully.\n\nWait, let me re-read the examples carefully:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nRow1: \"50600\"\nRow2: \"54440\"\nRow3: \"00600\"\nRow4: \"00000\"\nRow5: \"00000\"\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nRow1: \"50600\"\nRow2: \"54440\"\nRow3: \"00600\"\nRow4: \"00600\"\nRow5: \"04440\"\n\nMaybe the rule is: copy row3 to row4, and then row2 with the first digit replaced with 0? But row2 was \"54440\", row5 output is \"04440\", which is row2 but with the first digit changed from 5 to 0. But then E.g. 2? Let's check E.g. 2.\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\nRow1: \"5088000\"\nRow2: \"5007000\"\nRow3: \"5004400\"\nRow4: \"0033000\"\nRow5: \"0011000\"\nRow6: \"0000000\"\nRow7: \"0000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000\"\nOutput:\nRow1: \"5088000\"\nRow2: \"5007000\"\nRow3: \"5004400\"\nRow4: \"0033000\"\nRow5: \"0011000\"\nRow6: \"0088000\"\nRow7: \"0007000\"\nRow8: \"0004400\"\n\nObservations: The top part remains same as input. The bottom rows are changed. In particular, row6 becomes \"0088000\" while row6 input was \"0000000\". Similarly, row7 becomes \"0007000\", row8 becomes \"0004400\". And note that these numbers seem to be taken from rows 3,2,1? Let's check: row6 output \"0088000\" equals maybe row? Actually, row3 is \"5004400\", row2 is \"5007000\", row1 is \"5088000\". Not exactly. Let's try to see: In output, row6: \"0088000\", row7: \"0007000\", row8: \"0004400\". And then compare with input rows maybe reversed order? Possibly rule: The output grid is formed by taking the bottom part of the grid and filling with some transformation of the top part.\n\nIdea: Possibly the transformation rule has to do with \"shrinking\" the grid horizontally, maybe a rotation or reflection? Alternatively, maybe the rule is: \"copy the top part of the grid to the bottom, and then mirror some rows\"? Wait, let's re-read examples.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: \"Take a grid and then add a reflection of some central part to the bottom.\" Let's check E.g.1: It might be that the bottom part of the grid is a reflection of the top part across some horizontal axis. But then row4 should equal row2? But row2 is \"54440\". But row4 output is \"00600\", not \"54440\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe rule is: \"Replace rows that are blank with adjacent rows that contain nonzero digits, thus forming a continuous pattern.\"\n\nLet's think: In E.g.1, the first three rows are not blank. The 4th row is blank, so it gets replaced by the immediate preceding row that is not blank (row3)? And the 5th row, which is blank, gets replaced by the immediate preceding nonblank row? But then row4 input blank becomes row3, row5 becomes row? But then row5 output \"04440\" is not row3. Alternatively, maybe the rule is: \"Reflect the top part (the first nonblank row) downward, and then apply a transformation to each row as you go.\" But check: In E.g.1, blank rows below row3 become modified copies of row3? But row3 is \"00600\". But row4 output is \"00600\", which is exactly row3. But then row5 output \"04440\" is not exactly row3. But wait, \"04440\" vs \"00600\" difference: the hundreds digit of row4 is 0, but row5 output is 04440, which seems like row2 output \"54440\" with the first digit replaced by 0? That is odd.\n\nLet's try E.g.2: The bottom rows are row6, row7, row8 in output. In input, rows 6-8 are blank (\"0000000\"). In output, they become \"0088000\", \"0007000\", \"0004400\". Notice that the top part in E.g.2 (rows 1-5) are unchanged. And then the bottom part (rows 6-8) are derived from rows 3-1? Let's check: row6 output \"0088000\": maybe it's row3 input with its first digit replaced by 0? Wait, row3 input is \"5004400\". Not matching.\nMaybe they are derived from rows 4? Let's check: row4 input is \"0033000\", row5 is \"0011000\". But row6 output \"0088000\" doesn't match either.\n\nLet's list E.g.2 input rows:\nRow1: 5088000\nRow2: 5007000\nRow3: 5004400\nRow4: 0033000\nRow5: 0011000\nRow6: 0000000\nRow7: 0000000\nRow8: 0000000\n\nOutput rows (with changes only in bottom three):\nRow6: 0088000\nRow7: 0007000\nRow8: 0004400\n\nMaybe the bottom rows are derived by taking the digits from the top rows and moving them one row down? Perhaps rule: \"move a block from the top of the grid to the bottom row, shifting the block one row down.\" For instance, in E.g.1, the bottom two rows are blank; then copy row3 to row4, and then copy row2 to row5 but with the leftmost digit replaced by 0? But then why would row5 be \"04440\"? It might be that row5 output is row? Actually, maybe rule: \"Take the bottom-most non-blank row and copy it into the next blank row, then repeat, but with a twist: the copied row gets shifted one digit to the left, or its leftmost digit becomes 0.\" But then check E.g.1: The bottom-most non-blank row is row3 \"00600\". When copying to row4, it becomes \"00600\". But then the next blank row gets the row above it? That is row2? But row2 is \"54440\", but row5 output is \"04440\", which is row2 with the first digit changed to 0. Similarly, in E.g.2: The bottom-most non-blank row is row5 \"0011000\". Copying it to row6 would yield \"0011000\", but output row6 is \"0088000\". That doesn't match.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Reflect the top part of the grid along a horizontal axis and then perform a sort of cumulative addition of digits from above rows?\" Wait, check E.g.3:", "prompt_tokens": 775, "completion_tokens": 2048}

{"task_id": "12997ef3", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus:free", "raw_response": "We are given several pairs examples. The instructions: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\"\n\nWe are given multiple examples: There are e.g. 1, e.g. 2, e.g. 3, e.g. 4. Each example has a different transformation.\n\nWe are given further the final test input grid. We need to deduce the rule from the examples and then produce the test output grid.\n\nLet's re-read the given examples.\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput grid lines:\nRow 0: \"00000000000000\" (16 columns, 12 rows? Actually check: The provided e.g. 1 shows 12 rows? Actually let me re-read carefully: The \"e.g. 1 Input:\" lines are:\n\"00000000000000\"\n\"01010000000000\"\n\"00100000000000\"\n\"01110000000000\"\n\"00000000000000\"\n\"00000000000000\"\n\"00000000000000\"\n\"00002030400000\"\n\"00000000000000\"\n\"00000000000000\"\n\"00000000000000\"\n\nWait, it says e.g. 1. Let me count rows: Actually, the lines:\nLine1: \"00000000000000\"\nLine2: \"01010000000000\"\nLine3: \"00100000000000\"\nLine4: \"01110000000000\"\nLine5: \"00000000000000\"\nLine6: \"00000000000000\"\nLine7: \"00000000000000\"\nLine8: \"00002030400000\"\nLine9: \"00000000000000\"\nLine10:\"00000000000000\"\nLine11:\"00000000000000\"\n\nSo that's 11 rows. But then the output grid given is:\nE.g. 1 Output:\n\"202303404\" \n\"020030040\"\n\"222333444\"\n\nWait, that's 3 rows by 9 columns? Let's check: \"202303404\" is 9 digits, \"020030040\" is 9 digits, \"222333444\" is 9 digits. So transformation: Input: 11 rows, 16 columns? Actually count columns in first input row: \"00000000000000\" is 14 digits? Let me count: \"00000000000000\" has 14 zeros if we count? Let's count carefully: \"00000000000000\" I count: There is \"00000000000000\" let me count digits: There's 1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0. Wait, it's \"00000000000000\" is 14 digits? But then e.g. 1 output is 9 digits. Let me re-read the string exactly: e.g. 1 Input: \"00000000000000\" - I must check carefully: The strings \"00000000000000\" might be 14 digits if there are 14 zeros? Wait, I'll count manually: I'll count them: \"00000000000000\" count: \nThere is no punctuation, so count: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13? But then the next row: \"01010000000000\" count digits: \"0\" then \"1\" then \"0\" then \"1\" then \"0\" then \"0000000...\". That row is 14 digits. So input grid is 11 rows by 14 columns. Output grid is 3 rows by 9 columns. So transformation reduces grid in size.\n\nSimilarly, e.g. 2:\nInput grid lines: \n\"000000000\" (9 digits) \n\"000003000\" (9) \n\"000000000\"\n\"000006000\"\n\"011000000\" \n\"111008000\"\n\"010000000\"\n\"000000000\"\n\"000000000\"\n\"000000000\"\n\"000000000\" (Total rows 11 rows)\n\nAnd output is:\n\"033\" \n\"333\" \n\"030\" \n\"066\" \n\"666\" \n\"060\" \n\"088\" \n\"888\" \n\"080\"\n\nSo 9 rows by 3 columns output.\n\ne.g. 3:\nInput grid: \n\"0011000000\" (10 digits) \n\"0110000000\"\n\"0011000000\"\n\"0000000000\" \n\"0000000000\" \n\"0000000000\"\n\"0302000000\"\n\"0000000000\"\n\"0000000000\"\n\"0000000000\"\n\"0000000000\"\nRows: 11 rows, 10 columns.\nOutput grid: \n\"033022\" \n\"330220\"\n\"033022\"\nSo output is 3 rows by 6 columns.\n\ne.g. 4:\nInput grid:\n\"00000000000\" (11 digits)\n\"00000006000\"\n\"00010000000\"\n\"00110002000\"\n\"00001000000\"\n\"00000000000\"\n\"00000000000\"\n\"00000000000\"\n\"00000000000\"\n\"00000000000\"\n\"00000000000\"\nRows: 11 rows, 11 columns.\nOutput grid:\n\"060\" \n\"660\"\n\"006\"\n\"020\"\n\"220\"\n\"002\"\nSo output is 6 rows by 3 columns.\n\nSo from these examples, the transformation likely involves extracting a pattern from the input grid that is \"rotated\" or \"mirrored\" and concatenating some numbers? The outputs appear to be reordering digits from the input grid, maybe reading diagonals or something.\n\nLet's analyze each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput grid 11 rows x 14 columns.\n\nThe input grid (I'll denote coordinates row, col, and maybe note non-zero digits):\n\nI'll parse e.g. 1 input:\nRow0: \"00000000000000\" (all zeros) but length? Wait, count digits: It is \"00000000000000\". Count them: 14 zeros.\nRow1: \"01010000000000\": digits: index0:0, index1:1, index2:0, index3:1, index4:0, then zeros.\nRow2: \"00100000000000\": digits: 0,0,1,0,... then zeros.\nRow3: \"01110000000000\": digits: 0,1,1,1,0,... then zeros.\nRow4: \"00000000000000\": all zeros.\nRow5: \"00000000000000\": all zeros.\nRow6: \"00000000000000\": zeros.\nRow7: \"00002030400000\": digits: 0,0,0,0,2,0,3,0,4,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow8: \"00000000000000\": zeros.\nRow9: \"00000000000000\": zeros.\nRow10:\"00000000000000\": zeros.\n\nOutput e.g. 1:\nRow0: \"202303404\"\nRow1: \"020030040\"\nRow2: \"222333444\"\n\nObservation: The output numbers are mostly digits 2,0,2,3,0,3,0,4,0, then next row \"020030040\", then \"222333444\". They seem to be extracted from input? They appear to be reading diagonally perhaps? Let\u2019s check input positions that are non-zero:\nRow1: positions: col1 and col3? Actually, row1: \"01010000000000\": non-zero digits at col1=1, col3=1 maybe? But output row0 starts with \"202303404\" which has digits \"2\" and \"3\", \"4\", etc. But row1 input only had 1's.\n\nMaybe the transformation: It might be reading columns from bottom-right triangle? Wait, I'll try to see if the output grid has rows with counts that sum to 9 columns. Possibly the transformation picks out the \"largest digit\" in each cell of the output grid by scanning along diagonals from the bottom right of the input grid? For instance, consider e.g. 1: The non-zero digits in input appear in row1, row2, row3, row7. Let's list their coordinates with values:\nRow1: col1 = 1, col3 = 1.\nRow2: col2 = 1? Actually row2: \"00100000000000\" means col? Let's index: col0=0, col1=0, col2=1, col3=0, rest zeros.\nRow3: \"01110000000000\": col1=1, col2=1, col3=1, col4=0.\nRow7: \"00002030400000\": let's index: col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=0, col4=2, col5=0, col6=3, col7=0, col8=4, col9=0, col10=0, col11=0, col12=0, col13=0.\nSo the non-zero digits are: (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (", "prompt_tokens": 761, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's analyze the examples individually and try to discover pattern.\n\nWe have e.g. 1 Input and output:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nRow1: 00107770\nRow2: 88005500\nRow3: 08800550\nRow4: 01108001\nRow5: 07018000\nRow6: 80001070\nRow7: 08881000\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nRow1: 00307770\nRow2: 88005500\nRow3: 08800550\nRow4: 03303003\nRow5: 03033000\nRow6: 30003030\nRow7: 08883000\n\nObserving differences row by row:\n\nLet's list them as arrays, but note each row is a string of digits, but they might be interpreted as a grid of digits. Let me represent each digit as a number.\n\nE.g.1 input row1: \"00107770\" digits: 0,0,1,0,7,7,7,0. Output row1: \"00307770\": digits: 0,0,3,0,7,7,7,0. So row1 changed: the third digit changed from 1 to 3. Possibly addition of 2? But row1: position likely central? But then row2: \"88005500\" remains same? row3: \"08800550\" remains same? row4: \"01108001\" becomes \"03303003\". Let's check row4 digits: input: 0,1,1,0,8,0,0,1. Output: 0,3,3,0,3,0,0,3. So row4 changed: positions 2,3 changed from 1,1 to 3,3. row5: \"07018000\" becomes \"03033000\": digits: input: 0,7,0,1,8,0,0,0; output: 0,3,0,3,3,0,0,0. So row5 changed: second digit changed from 7 to 3, third digit changed from 0 to 0? Actually check: 0 7 0 1 8 0 0 0 becomes 0 3 0 3 3 0 0 0. So changes: digit2 and digit4 changed from 7 to 3 and 1 to 3? row6: \"80001070\" becomes \"30003030\": digits: input: 8,0,0,0,1,0,7,0; output: 3,0,0,0,3,0,3,0. Changes: first digit changed from 8 to 3, then digit5 changed from 1 to 3, and digit7 changed from 7 to 3. row7: \"08881000\" becomes \"08883000\": digits: input: 0,8,8,8,1,0,0,0; output: 0,8,8,8,3,0,0,0. So only digit5 changed from 1 to 3.\n\nSo pattern: Some digits changed to 3 from 1 or 7 or 8 maybe? Let's check positions across rows:\nRow1: index 3 changed from 1 to 3.\nRow4: positions 2 and 3 changed from 1 to 3.\nRow5: position 2 changed from 7 to 3? Actually row5: the second digit was originally 7 and changed to 3; the fourth digit changed from 1 to 3.\nRow6: first digit changed from 8 to 3; fifth digit changed from 1 to 3; seventh digit changed from 7 to 3.\nRow7: fifth digit changed from 1 to 3.\nRow2 and row3 are unchanged.\n\nMaybe the rule is to replace digits that are \"1\" or \"7\" or \"8\" with \"3\"? But then row2 no digit? Row2: \"88005500\": digits: 8,8,0,0,5,5,0,0. But it remains unchanged. So pattern not \"1/7/8 to 3\" because row2 had 8's but didn't change.\n\nMaybe rule: There is pattern of connectivity? Maybe the transformation rule is \"mirror\" or \"rotate\"? Let's check differences more carefully.\n\nObserving positions that changed: row1: (col3) changed. row4: col2 and col3. row5: col2 and col4. row6: col1, col5, col7. row7: col5.\n\nMaybe these positions correspond to the positions of a specific shape in the grid? Possibly the transformation rule is \"outline\" or \"highlight\" the shape made of digits that are not symmetrical?\n\nLet's try to see if the changed digits are maybe the ones that are adjacent to a 1? Alternatively, maybe the transformation rule is: Look for \"1\", \"7\", and \"8\" and then add 2 to them, but then mod something? But then row6: first digit 8 changed to 3 which is not (8+2=10 mod 10=0) or something.\n\nMaybe consider differences: In row1, the digit changed from 1 to 3. That's an increment of 2. In row4, the digits changed from 1 to 3, again increment of 2. In row5, digit originally 7 becomes 3, that's -4 mod something? And digit originally 1 becomes 3, increment of 2. In row6, first digit originally 8 becomes 3, that is a decrease of 5. And digit originally 1 becomes 3 (increment 2) and digit originally 7 becomes 3 (decrease of 4). And in row7, digit originally 1 becomes 3 (increment 2). So changes are sometimes +2, sometimes -4, sometimes -5? That doesn't look consistent.\n\nMaybe rule: \"Replace all instances of 1 with 3\" except when they are in certain positions? Check row1: 1 replaced with 3, row4: 1 replaced with 3, row5: digit 1 replaced with 3, row7: digit 1 replaced with 3. But then row6: digit 1 replaced with 3. So all 1's become 3's. But then what about 7's? In row5, digit 7 became 3 (but it's originally 7, not 1). In row6, digit 7 became 3. And what about 8's? In row6, digit 8 became 3. In row2, row2 had 8's that did not change. And row3 had no changed digits. So rule might be: Replace all digits that are on the \"spine\" or \"center\" of the grid? Look at coordinates: row1 changed col3. row4 changed col2 and col3. row5 changed col2 and col4. row6 changed col1, col5, col7. row7 changed col5.\n\nMaybe the changed coordinates are: (1,3) (using 1-indexed rows and columns). (4,2) and (4,3). (5,2) and (5,4) but careful: row5: \"07018000\": index positions: index 1:0, index2:7, index3:0, index4:1, index5:8, index6:0, index7:0, index8:0. Changed indices: index2 becomes 3, index4 becomes 3. (6,1), (6,5), (6,7) changed: row6: \"80001070\": index1:8 -> 3, index2:0, index3:0, index4:0, index5:1 -> 3, index6:0, index7:7 -> 3, index8:0. (7,5) changed: row7: \"08881000\": index1:0, index2:8, index3:8, index4:8, index5:1->3, index6:0, index7:0, index8:0.\n\nSo positions changed: (1,3), (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,4), (6,1), (6,5), (6,7), (7,5). Let's see if these form a pattern shape. Coordinates relative to grid size 8x8. Mark them on grid with coordinates (row, col) where row indices 1..7 and col indices 1..8.\n\nList changed coordinates (r, c):\n\n(1,3)\n(4,2), (4,3)\n(5,2), (5,4)\n(6,1), (6,5), (6,7)\n(7,5)\n\nPlot them:\nRow1: col3.\nRow2: none.\nRow3: none.\nRow4: col2 and col3.\nRow5: col2 and col4? Wait row5: it's (5,2) and (5,4). But careful: row numbering: example row numbering: row1 corresponds to first line \"", "prompt_tokens": 647, "completion_tokens": 2048}

They are both input-output pairs for ARC tasks. They are clearly grids represented as strings, but then we are provided the output as another grid string. The grid dimensions: Example 1: There are 7 rows? Actually check example 1:\nE.g. 1 Input:\n\"110020240005000\n101020240000000\n010022240000000\n000000040000000\n606033340000000\n060003040000000\n060030340000000\"\nE.g. 1 Output:\n\"0005000\n0001110\n0000060\n0000060\n0000220\n0333300\n0000000\"\n\nI can try to see patterns: They are all 7 rows, each row looks like 7 or 8 columns? Wait, I must count columns.\n\nFor example 1, first row: \"110020240005000\". Count characters: \n\"1\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\", \"2\", \"0\", \"2\", \"4\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"5\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\". That's 15 characters, so grid is 7 rows by 15 columns? Wait, 7 rows * ? columns = 15. Possibly there is 7 rows by 15 columns means each row is a string of 15 characters? But then E.g.1 Output: \"0005000\" is 7 characters, so maybe they are not the same shape? Wait, re-read instructions carefully.\n\nMaybe these \"grids\" are not fully rectangular but rather extracted from some region? Let me check: \"110020240005000\" string length is 15? Actually count properly: \"1\" \"1\" \"0\" \"0\" \"2\" \"0\" \"2\" \"4\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" \"5\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" = 15 characters. But then the output \"0005000\" is 7 characters. So the transformation changed the grid shape. Possibly the original grid is a 7x7 grid, and the numbers are encoded in some format? Let's re-read instructions: \"An expert in solving ARC problems\" They are examples of transformation rules. The examples are probably from the ARC dataset where the grid is represented as a string of digits.\n\nI suspect each digit is not a digit but part of a coordinate system representing colors. They might be a digit grid representing a colored grid in the ARC tasks. They might be 7x7 grids. Let's check dimensions: In the output of E.g. 1, each line \"0005000\" is 7 columns. In the output of E.g. 1, there are 7 rows. So the output grid is 7x7. So what is the input grid? It might be a different shape. Possibly the input grid is 7 rows by 7 columns as well, but the numbers are encoded in a specific pattern. Let's try to see: The output grid for E.g. 1 is: \nRow1: 0005000\nRow2: 0001110\nRow3: 0000060\nRow4: 0000060\nRow5: 0000220\nRow6: 0333300\nRow7: 0000000\n\nMaybe the transformation is: read the input grid's \"diagonals\" or something? Wait, look at the input grid for E.g. 1: It is a 7x? Actually, let me count columns by splitting by spaces. The provided input strings seem to be separated by newlines. There are 7 lines in each example. So each input grid is 7 rows. The number of characters in each input row: For row1: \"110020240005000\". Count: if I count manually: 1 (col1), 1 (col2), 0 (3), 0 (4), 2 (5), 0 (6), 2 (7), 4 (8), 0 (9), 0 (10), 0 (11), 5 (12), 0 (13), 0 (14), 0 (15). So row1 has 15 characters. Row2: \"101020240000000\". Count: 15 characters as well. So input grid is 7 rows by 15 columns? But output grid is 7 rows by 7 columns. So that is a drastic reduction. However, maybe the grid is not rectangular but the digits represent some kind of encoded pattern that when interpreted as a binary matrix of some sort, the transformation is to rearrange columns. Possibly the numbers in the input are not simply digits but are multi-digit numbers. For instance, \"11\" might represent a color code. But then the output digits are single-digit. So maybe the input grid is a concatenation of several numbers separated by boundaries. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the digits in the input are not individual cells but are block of three digits representing coordinates: maybe \"110\" means something? Let's see, \"110\" appears at beginning of row1. Could it be splitting into groups of three? 15 digits split into groups of 3 equals 5 groups. So each row in input has 5 groups. And output row has 7 digits. So maybe the transformation is: reading columns from these groups? For instance, take the first group of each row and arrange them in a particular order to form output. Let's test that idea with E.g. 1: Row1: groups: \"110\", \"020\", \"240\", \"005\", \"000\". Row2: \"101\", \"020\", \"240\", \"000\", \"000\". Row3: \"010\", \"022\", \"240\", \"000\", \"000\". Row4: \"000\", \"000\", \"040\", \"000\", \"000\". Row5: \"606\", \"033\", \"340\", \"000\", \"000\". Row6: \"060\", \"003\", \"040\", \"000\", \"000\". Row7: \"060\", \"030\", \"340\", \"000\", \"000\".\n\nMaybe the numbers represent something like coordinates? They might be split into three-digit numbers. For instance, \"110\" might be interpreted as (1,1,0)? But then \"240\" might be interpreted as (2,4,0)? And \"005\" as (0,5,0)? And output \"0005000\" means row1: maybe digits: 0,0,0,5,0,0,0. So maybe it's reading something like: the middle group \"240\" gives the 4 and 0, but then the output \"0005000\" might be the result of overlaying something on a 7x7 blank grid. I recall some ARC tasks where you have a grid and you overlay shapes. Possibly the transformation rule is: given an input grid that encodes a set of triangles or something, the output grid is a pattern obtained by drawing lines connecting certain points. \nI recall that ARC tasks sometimes have a rule where you draw a diagonal line from one corner to the opposite corner, etc.\n\nLet's try to analyze the pattern across examples. \n\nI see that in all examples, there is a recurring segment \"000000040000000\". That might be a marker. In example 1, row4 is \"000000040000000\". In example 2, row4 is \"000000040000000\", row8 is \"000000040000000\", row12 is \"000000040000000\". So maybe \"000000040000000\" is some kind of separator row. And in example 3, row4 and row8 are \"000000040000000\". So that row might be a border or something that gets removed in output? But output grids do not have that row. Wait, but output grid rows count: For E.g. 1, there are 7 rows output. And the input had 7 rows. So not all rows are removed. Let me re-read the examples:\n\nE.g. 1 Input: 7 rows. E.g. 1 Output: 7 rows.\nE.g. 2 Input: 16 rows? Let's count: It shows:\n\"202060640500000\" (1)\n\"202006040000000\" (2)\n\"222006040000000\" (3)\n\"000000040000000\" (4)\n\"110033340000000\" (5)\n\"101003040000000\" (6)\n\"010030340000000\" (7)\n\"000000040000000\" (8)\n\"110060640000000\" (9)\n\"101006040000000\" (10)\n\"010006040000000\" (11)\n\"000000040000000\" (12)\n\"606011040000000\" (13)\n\"060010140000000\" (14)\n\"060001040000000\" (15)\nE.g. 2 Output: 16 rows?

Let's analyze the differences row by row:\n\n- Rows 1-3: unchanged, all zeros.\n- Row 4: input \"000000444440000\", output is same.\n- Row 5: input \"000000000000000\", output becomes \"000000444440000\". So row 5 got replaced with row 4's content? But then row 6: input row \"000000000000000\" becomes \"000000444440000\" as well.\n- Row 7: input \"888800000000000\" becomes \"888800444440000\". So row 7 got extended with same pattern as row 4 maybe?\n- Row 8: input \"000000000000000\" becomes \"888800444440000\". So row 8 takes row 7's bottom part?\n- Row 9: input \"000000000000000\" becomes \"888800444440000\".\n- Row 10: input \"000000000000000\" becomes \"888800444440000\".\n- Row 11: input \"000000000000000\" becomes \"888800444440000\".\n- Row 12: input \"000000033300000\" becomes \"888800433340000\". So row 12 becomes row 7's top? But \"888800\" then \"433340000\". The difference: row 12 originally had \"033300000\" becomes \"433340000\" in the output. And row 13 and 14 become same as row 12's output.\n- Row 15: input \"000000000000000\" becomes \"888800433340000\".\n- Row 16: input \"555555555555555\" remains same.\n\nIt appears that the transformation fills the grid with \"flood fill\" style propagation? Possibly it takes a \"seed\" region and then fills upward and downward? Possibly the transformation draws continuous regions from the bottom-most non-zero rows upward or something. Let's re-read the second example.\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\n```\n00000000000000005\n00000000000200005\n00000000000200005\n00000000000000005\n00000030000000005\n00000030000000005\n00000030000000005\n00700030000000005\n00700000000000005\n00700000000000005\n00700000000000005\n00000000000000005\n00000000000000005\n00000000000000005\n00000000000000005\n00000000000000005\n```\nE.g. 2 Output:\n```\n00000000000000005\n00000000000222225\n00000000000222225\n00000000000000005\n00000033333333335\n00000033333333335\n00000033333333335\n00777733333333335\n00777777777777775\n00777777777777775\n00777777777777775\n00000000000000005\n00000000000000005\n00000000000000005\n00000000000000005\n00000000000000005\n```\nObserving differences: The rightmost column always remains \"5\". The left part changes.\n\nLook row by row:\nRow1: \"00000000000000005\" stays same.\nRow2: \"00000000000200005\" becomes \"00000000000222225\". So the portion \"2000\" becomes \"2222\". Actually, careful: row2 input \"00000000000200005\" digits: there's a \"2\" at position index? Let's index positions: columns from 0 to 15 maybe. Actually, each row is 16 digits maybe? But the provided strings, count digits: \"00000000000000005\" is 16 digits? Actually, check: They are given with no spaces. Let's count: \"00000000000000005\" is 17 digits if we count? Let's check: Actually, it might be 16 columns? Let's count: \"00000000000000005\" count digits: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16? Actually, the provided examples differ in row length, so the grid might be rectangular but not necessarily square? E.g. 1 input has 16 rows, and each row has 16 digits? Let's check: \"000000000000000\" is 15 digits? Actually, count manually: \"000000000000000\" - count zeros: There are 15 zeros? Let's count: \"000000000000000\" might be 15 zeros? Wait, I'll count carefully.\n\nE.g. 1 input row1: \"000000000000000\". Count: There are 15 characters? Let's count: I'll count indices: It might be 16 rows of 16 columns? But the examples E.g. 1: Each row seems to have 16 digits? Let's count first row: \"000000000000000\" - It might be 16 characters if we include the possibility that the trailing \"0\" is missing? Wait, I'll re-read the provided text: \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then list lines. They are all 15 characters? Actually, let's count manually: \"000000000000000\" - There are 15 zeros? Actually, I count: \"000000000000000\" if I group in 3's: \"000 000 000 000 000\" that's 5 groups, each group of 3 zeros gives 15 zeros. So row length 15. But then row 4: \"000000444440000\" has length 15: count: \"000000\" (6 zeros) then \"44444\" (5 digits) then \"0000\" (4 zeros) totals 6+5+4 = 15, yes. So grid is 15 rows by 15 columns for e.g. 1. Similarly, e.g. 2: Count row1: \"00000000000000005\": count: \"000000000000000\" = 15 zeros then \"05\" = 2 digits, so 17 columns. But then row2: \"00000000000200005\" is also 17 digits. So grid size is 17 columns by 16 rows maybe? Wait, check rows count: e.g. 2 input: There are 16 lines. So grid is 16 rows by 17 columns. Similarly e.g. 3 input: Count row1: \"50000000000000000\" count: \"5\" then \"0000000000000000\" that's 1+15 = 16 digits, but actually look: \"50000000000000000\" seems to be 17 digits (because row 4: \"50000000030006000\" count: 1 digit \"5\", then \"00000000030006000\" is 16 digits total, so row length is 17). So maybe the grids are rectangular with varying dimensions.\n\nBut the main point: We need to deduce rule. Let's analyze e.g. 1 transformation in detail.\n\nE.g. 1: Input grid (15 rows x 15 columns) and output grid. Observing pattern:\n- There is a block \"44444\" in row4, column positions 6 to 10 maybe, because row4: \"000000444440000\" (if columns indexed 0 to 14, then columns 6-10 are 4's, and then columns 11-14 are 0's). And then subsequent rows below row4 become filled with that block in the same column positions. Let's check: row5 becomes \"000000444440000\". Row6 becomes \"000000444440000\". But then row7 originally was \"888800000000000\" becomes \"888800444440000\". So row7, which originally had \"88880\" in beginning, then zeros, now becomes \"88880\" then \"44444\" then", "prompt_tokens": 1208, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We need to deduce hidden transformation rule. Let's first re-read the examples details.\n\nWe have three examples, with input and output grids. They are provided as rows, each row a string of 10 digits. The problem likely is from ARC, and hidden transformation rule maybe it's some kind of block replacement. Look carefully.\n\nExample 1:\nInput lines:\n1: \"5505505500\"\n2: \"5505505500\"\n3: \"0000000000\"\n4: \"5505505500\"\n5: \"5505505500\"\n6: \"0000000000\"\n7: \"5505505500\"\n8: \"5505505500\"\n9: \"0000000000\"\n10: \"0000000000\"\n\nOutput lines:\n1: \"5525525500\"\n2: \"5525525500\"\n3: \"2222222211\"\n4: \"5525525500\"\n5: \"5525525500\"\n6: \"2222222211\"\n7: \"5525525500\"\n8: \"5525525500\"\n9: \"0010010000\"\n10: \"0010010000\"\n\nObserving differences between input and output:\n\n- Compare input row1: \"5505505500\" becomes \"5525525500\". How can we get that? It seems that segments \"55\" remain, but then \"0\" becomes \"2\"? Or \"550\" becomes \"552\"? Let's examine columns.\n\nI check row1, column by column:\nInput row1: digits: col1: 5, col2: 5, col3: 0, col4: 5, col5: 5, col6: 0, col7: 5, col8: 5, col9: 0, col10: 0.\nOutput row1: digits: 5, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5, 5, 0, ?? Wait recalc: \"5525525500\". Let's index columns:\ncol1: '5'\ncol2: '5'\ncol3: '2'\ncol4: '5'\ncol5: '2'\ncol6: '5'\ncol7: '5'\ncol8: '5'\ncol9: '0'\ncol10: '0'\nI see transformation: It might be replacing the 0's in some positions with 2's, but not all 0's become 2's. Compare col3: input 0 becomes 2 in output. col6: input 0 becomes 5 in output? Wait, check col6: input row1 col6 is 0, but output row1 col6 is \"5\"? Let's check: Actually, re-read carefully: The provided row1: \"5505505500\". Let me break it into groups: maybe it's groups of three digits? But then \"550\" appears three times? Actually, 10 digits could be chunked as 5 groups of 2 digits, but then the transformation seems to change some digits. Let me try to see pattern in example 1 rows that have 550 pattern.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: For any contiguous block of 5 rows and 5 columns? Maybe it's reflecting some structure.\n\nAlternate approach: Compare entire grid patterns in examples. E.g. 1 input grid: It has a pattern repeated. The grid dimensions: 10 rows x 10 columns. And the pattern seems to be in blocks: The first block (rows 1-3?) Actually, look at row groups: rows 1-2 are \"5505505500\". Then row3 is \"0000000000\". Then rows 4-5 are same as rows 1-2. Then row6 is \"0000000000\". Then rows 7-8 are same as rows 1-2. Then row9 is \"0000000000\". Then row10 is \"0000000000\".\n\nNow output grid: rows 1-2 become \"5525525500\". row3 becomes \"2222222211\". rows 4-5 become \"5525525500\". row6 becomes \"2222222211\". rows 7-8 become \"5525525500\". row9 becomes \"0010010000\". row10 becomes \"0010010000\".\n\nObserving row structure:\n- In rows that were originally \"5505505500\", they become \"5525525500\". So transformation: \"550\" becomes \"552\" in some positions maybe.\n- In rows that were originally \"0000000000\", they become \"2222222211\" in rows 3 and 6, but then later rows 9-10 become \"0010010000\".\n\nWait, let's check: Actually, in example 1, row3 is \"0000000000\" becomes \"2222222211\". And row6 \"0000000000\" becomes \"2222222211\". But row9 \"0000000000\" becomes \"0010010000\". And row10 \"0000000000\" becomes \"0010010000\". So apparently transformation depends on row group index maybe.\n\nAlso look at example 2:\nInput rows:\n1: \"0055005500\"\n2: \"0055005500\"\n3: \"0000000000\"\n4: \"0055005500\"\n5: \"0055005500\"\n6: \"0000000000\"\n7: \"0055005500\"\n8: \"0055005500\"\n9: \"0000000000\"\n10:\"0000000000\"\nOutput rows:\n1: \"0055225500\"\n2: \"0055225500\"\n3: \"1122222211\"\n4: \"0055225500\"\n5: \"0055225500\"\n6: \"1122222211\"\n7: \"0055225500\"\n8: \"0055225500\"\n9: \"0000110000\"\n10:\"0000110000\"\n\nSo now compare row1: Input \"0055005500\" becomes \"0055225500\". So transformation changed some digits.\nRow3: \"0000000000\" becomes \"1122222211\".\nRow9: \"0000000000\" becomes \"0000110000\".\n\nExample 3:\nInput rows:\n1: \"0550550550\"\n2: \"0550550550\"\n3: \"0000000000\"\n4: \"0000000000\"\n5: \"0550550550\"\n6: \"0550550550\"\n7: \"0000000000\"\n8: \"0000000000\"\n9: \"0550550550\"\n10:\"0550550550\"\nOutput rows:\n1: \"0552552550\"\n2: \"0552552550\"\n3: \"1222222221\"\n4: \"1222222221\"\n5: \"0552552550\"\n6: \"0552552550\"\n7: \"1222222221\"\n8: \"1222222221\"\n9: \"0552552550\"\n10:\"0552552550\"\n\nObserving pattern: The transformation seems to involve \"adding\" something to certain digits. In many cases, the output digit is either the same as input digit if input digit is 5, or changed to something else if input digit is 0. But also sometimes 0 becomes 2, sometimes becomes 1, sometimes becomes 0? Let's compare individual digits column-wise maybe. Actually, maybe the transformation is applied to columns that represent a pattern shape.\n\nI suspect the puzzle is from ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) and typically the transformation is like \"in each 3x3 block, color the center\" etc. But these grids are 10x10. Maybe we can think of them as having repeating pattern segments. Let's try to see if there is a pattern of repeated blocks.\nMaybe we can identify fixed patterns: For instance, in Example 1, look at row groups:\nGroup A: rows 1-2 are identical, then row3 is different, then group B: rows 4-5 same as group A, then row6 same as row3, then group C: rows 7-8 same as group A, then row9 same as row3, then row10 same as row9? Actually, check: row9 output \"0010010000\" is different from row3 \"2222222211\".\n\nLet's write down examples with row indices and note differences between input and output:\n\nFor Example 1:\nRow 1: Input: 5505505500, Output: 5525525500\nRow 2: same.\nRow 3: Input: 0000000000, Output: 2222222211\nRow 4: Input: 5505505500, Output: 5525525500\nRow 5: same.\nRow 6: Input: 0000000000, Output: 2222222211\nRow 7: Input: 5505505500, Output: 5525525500\nRow 8: same.\nRow 9: Input: 0000000000, Output: 0010010000\nRow 10: Input: 0000000000, Output: 0010010000\n\nFor Example 2:\nRow 1: Input: 0055005500, Output: 0055225500\nRow 2: same.\nRow 3: Input: 0000000000, Output: 1122222211\nRow 4: Input: 0055005500, Output: 0055225500\nRow 5: same.\nRow 6: Input: 0000000000, Output: 1122222211", "prompt_tokens": 771, "completion_tokens": 2048}

So row2: has one \"1\" at index 11.\nRow3: \"8888888888888\": all 8's.\nRow4: \"8818888888888\": maybe has \"8\" at index0, \"8\" at index1, then \"1\" at index2, then rest 8's.\nRow5: \"8888888888888\": all 8's.\nRow6: \"8888888888888\": all 8's.\nRow7: \"8888888881888\": possibly has \"1\" at index10 maybe.\nRow8: \"8888888888888\": all 8's.\nRow9: \"8888888888888\": all 8's.\nRow10: \"8888818888888\": similar pattern to row4.\nRow11: \"8888888888888\": all 8's.\nRow12: \"8888888888888\": all 8's.\nRow13: \"8888888888888\": all 8's.\n\nSo input grid has 13 rows and 13 columns. Some positions are replaced by 1. Which positions? Let's map coordinates with (row, col) with row index starting at 0:\nRow0: all 8's.\nRow1: col11 = 1.\nRow3: row3: \"8818888888888\": so col0:8, col1:8, col2:1, then col3 onward 8's.\nRow6: \"8888888881888\": so row6: col? Let's check: \"8888888881888\": maybe col? Actually if I count: row6: \"8888888881888\", count digits: if index0:8, index1:8, index2:8, index3:8, index4:8, index5:8, index6:8, index7:8, index8:8, index9:8, index10:1, index11:8, index12:8. So row6: col10 = 1.\nRow10: \"8888818888888\": so row10: maybe col? Let's check: row10: \"8888818888888\": digits: index0:8, index1:8, index2:8, index3:8, index4:8, index5:1, index6:8, index7:8, index8:8, index9:8, index10:8, index11:8, index12:8. So row10: col5 = 1.\n\nThen output grid for E.g. 1:\nRow1: \"8818818881313\"\nRow2: \"1111111111121\"\nRow3: \"8313818881313\"\nRow4: \"1121111111111\"\nRow5: \"8313818881818\"\nRow6: \"8818818831318\"\nRow7: \"1111111112111\"\nRow8: \"8818818831318\"\nRow9: \"8818313881818\"\nRow10:\"1111121111111\"\nRow11:\"8818313881818\"\nRow12:\"8818818881818\"\nRow13:\"8818818881818\"\n\nWait, output rows count is 13 as well. But the output seems to have digits: 1,8,3? In row1: \"8818818881313\". It has digits: 8,8,1,8,8,1,8,8,8,1,3,1,3. So digits: 8,8,1,8,8,1,... There are digits 1,3 also present. In row2: \"1111111111121\": it has only 1 and last digit 1, but mostly 1's? Actually row2: \"1111111111121\" has 1's and one 2 at the end? Let's check: \"1111111111121\": count digits: there are 13 digits, and digit '2' appears at index 11 if I'm not mistaken? Let's check: It might be \"1111111111121\": possibly index 11 is '2'? \"111111111111\" would be 12 ones then 1, but given output: \"1111111111121\" maybe the 2 is at index 12? Let's re-read the provided output for E.g. 1: It's given as:\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n8818818881313\n1111111111121\n8313818881313\n1121111111111\n8313818881818\n8818818831318\n1111111112111\n8818818831318\n8818313881818\n1111121111111\n8818313881818\n8818818881818\n8818818881818\n\nI need to verify each row length: They are 13 characters long. They include digits: 1,8,3,2. So transformation rule might be something like: \"Replace each 1 in input with some pattern of digits\" but the input had only 8 and 1. But the output includes 3,2 etc.\n\nMaybe the transformation is more like: It might be applying a \"pattern\" that uses the positions of the ones in the input to modify surrounding cells in the output.\n\nLet's try to see if the outputs might be formed by \"flood fill\" or \"neighbors\" replacement. \nObservation: In E.g. 1, the input ones are at positions: (1,11), (3,2), (6,10), (10,5). And the output grid has a pattern that seems to \"spread\" from these positions? For instance, row1 of output: \"8818818881313\". The original row1 had \"8888888888818\". So row1: index 11 originally 1. In output row1, we see \"8818818881313\". Possibly the transformation is that the ones become \"1313\" pattern in neighbor positions? But then row2 of output \"1111111111121\": row2 originally \"", "prompt_tokens": 843, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Output: \"0050424550500054555\". They differ in one digit, the digit \"4\" replaced by \"2\"? Let's check: \nIndex: \n0:0,1:0,2:5,3:0,4:4,5:5,6:4? Actually, let me align:\nInput: 0 0 5 0 4 4 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5\nOutput: 0 0 5 0 4 2 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5\nSo the change is at digit index 5?

Wait, count characters: Actually, length? Let's count manually: The string \"0050454550500054555\" should have length 20 maybe? Let's count: Provided string \"0050454550500054555\" count digits: \"0\" \"0\" \"5\" \"0\" \"4\" \"4\" \"5\" \"4\" \"5\" \"5\" \"0\" \"5\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" \"5\" \"4\" \"5\" \"5\" \"5\". So 20 digits. Let me count: 0,0,5,0,4,4,5,4,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,5,5,5. There is a slight difference: Actually the output \"0050424550500054555\" count digits: \"0\",\"0\",\"5\",\"0\",\"4\",\"2\",\"4\",\"5\",\"5\",\"0\",\"5\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"5\",\"4\",\"5\",\"5\",\"5\" but then extra digit? Actually, wait, the provided output for e.g. 1 line 6: \"0050424550500054555\" is 20 digits? Let's count: 0,0,5,0,4,2,4,5,5,0,5,0,0,0,5,4,5,5,5? That would be 19 digits?

Let's check line 6: Input \"0050454550500054555\" changed to \"0050424550500054555\". Let's compare digit by digit:\n\"0050454550500054555\" vs \"0050424550500054555\". So the difference is at digit 5? Let's index: \n- digits: 0,0,5,0,4, then next digit: input has \"4\", output has \"2\"? Actually, let's check: \nDigits: index 0: 0,1:0,2:5,3:0,4:4, then index 5: input \"4\", output \"2\"? Let's check: Actually, let me label: \nInput: 0 0 5 0 4 4 5 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5 \nOutput: 0 0 5 0 4 2 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5 \nSo the change is at index 5: input \"4\" becomes \"2\". \nNow line 7:", "prompt_tokens": 1463, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Observing first row: \"44444444001410140104000\" becomes \"44444444001480840104000\". The difference: input: \"101401\" in the middle got changed? Let's compare positions precisely.\n\nWe have grid of rows, each string might be 20 characters? Let's count: They are all length 20? Checking row1: \"44444444001410140104000\" has length: I'll count: digits: \"44444444\" (8 digits) then \"0014\" maybe? Let's count: \"44444444\" is 8 digits. then \"0014\" is 4 digits? Wait, recalc: Actually, let's count exactly: \"44444444001410140104000\". Count manually:\nIndex: 0:4,1:4,2:4,3:4,4:4,5:4,6:4,7:4, then index8:0, index9:0, index10:1, index11:4, index12:1, index13:4, index14:0, index15:1, index16:4, index17:0, index18:0, index19:0, index20:0? Actually it's 21 digits? Not sure.\n\nWait check: For E.g.1, row 1: \"44444444001410140104000\". Let's count: Actually, it might be a 21-digit string. Let's count manually: \"44444444\" = 8 digits, then \"0014\" = 4 digits making 12, then \"101401\" = 6 digits making 18, then \"04000\" = 5 digits making 23 digits total. Wait, let's recalc properly. I'll count by grouping: \n\"44444444\" (8 digits) then \"0014\" (4 digits) equals 12, then \"101401\" (6 digits) equals 18, then \"04000\" (5 digits) equals 23. But then the output row1: \"44444444001480840104000\". Count digits: likely same length 23. Let's count: \"44444444\" (8) then \"0014\" (4) equals 12, then \"808401\" (6) equals 18, then \"04000\" (5) equals 23 digits. So grids are 23 columns wide. They are not square maybe but rectangular.\n\nI should check structure: The grids have some pattern: There are rows that are entirely \"4\" digits sometimes, and rows that are \"000\" etc. Possibly the transformation is something like \"rotate the grid by 90 degrees\" or \"flip\" or \"add some value\" but the differences are not trivial.\n\nMaybe I'll compare row1 input vs output: \nRow1 input: \"44444444001410140104000\"\nRow1 output: \"44444444001480840104000\"\nThe only difference is the substring from index 12 to index 17. Let's check indices: row1 input digits: \nIndices: \n0-7: \"44444444\"\n8-11: \"0014\"\n12-17: \"101401\"? Actually, wait, let's re-read: The string: \"44444444001410140104000\". Let me index: Characters:\n0:4,1:4,2:4,3:4,4:4,5:4,6:4,7:4,\n8:0,9:0,10:1,11:4,\n12:1,13:0,14:4,15:1,16:4,17:0,\n18:4,19:0,20:0,21:0,22:0? Possibly 23 columns.\nOutput: \"44444444001480840104000\". \nIt would be good to find positions that changed. \nAt row1, comparing substring starting at index 12: For input we see \"101401\", for output \"808401\". So the transformation: \"101401\" -> \"808401\". In that difference, the first digit changed from 1 to 8, and the second digit changed from 0 to 0, third digit 1 to 8, fourth digit 4 remains 4, fifth digit 0 remains 0, sixth digit 1 becomes 1? Actually check: \"101401\" vs \"808401\". Let's compare digit by digit:\nPosition: input: 1, output: 8.\nPosition: input: 0, output: 0.\nPosition: input: 1, output: 8.\nPosition: input: 4, output: 4.\nPosition: input: 0, output: 0.\nPosition: input: 1, output: 1? Actually, wait, \"808401\" digit by digit: 8,0,8,4,0,1.\nSo the transformation for that substring is: 1 -> 8, 0 -> 0, 1 -> 8, 4 -> 4, 0 -> 0, 1 -> 1. So maybe rule is: if digit is 1 or 4, then they become something?\nLet's look at row2 input vs row2 output: \nRow2 input: \"48800884001401040004010\".\nRow2 output: \"48800884001408040004010\".\nDifference: Compare substring starting at index? Let's see: row2, digits: maybe the difference is in the substring \"101400\" vs \"080400\"? Actually let's check: row2 input: \"48800884001401040004010\". Compare row2 output: \"48800884001408040004010\". The difference appears to be in the digits after \"488008840014\". Let's count: first part \"488008840014\" is same in both? Then row2 input: next substring \"01040004010\", row2 output: \"08040004010\". So the transformation is: \"010400\" becomes \"080400\". Compare digits: \"010400\" vs \"080400\". Digit by digit:\n0->0, 1->8, 0->0, 4->4, 0->0, 0->0. So the transformation is: digit 1 becomes 8.\n\nThen row3 input: \"48800884011400040004000\"\nRow3 output: \"48800884011400040004000\". No change. \nRow4 input: \"40088004444444444444444\"\nRow4 output: \"40088004444444444444444\". No change.\nRow5 input: \"40088004111401040004000\"\nRow5 output: \"40088004818401040004000\". \nDifference: Compare row5, substring: \"401140\" vs \"401184\"? Wait, let's check carefully: row5 input: \"40088004111401040004000\". Output row5: \"40088004818401040004000\". They are almost identical except the digits after \"4008800\" maybe. Let's locate the difference: They share initial \"4008800\". Then row5 input has \"411401040004000\" or something. Let's re-read row5:\nInput row5: \"40088004111401040004000\"\nOutput row5: \"40088004818401040004000\".\nIt appears the difference is in the substring starting at index 8 maybe: \"4114\" vs \"4814\". Actually, check: \"4008800\" then \"111401040004000\" vs \"481401040004000\". Yes, the transformation: \"1\" changed to \"8\" in the second digit of", "prompt_tokens": 1870, "completion_tokens": 2048}

It is ARC tasks. Our job: \"analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply rule to final test input grid.\"\n\nWe have grid examples. The provided examples are labelled \"E.g. 1\", \"E.g. 2\", \"E.g. 3\". And then we have a Test Input.\n\nThe transformation rule: \"deduce the rule from the examples and apply it to test input grid.\"\n\nObservations: All examples are grid puzzles in which digits are present. The input grid and output grid are similar in dimensions. Let's check each example.\n\nExample 1 Input vs Output:\nInput:\nLine lengths: Each line is 12 characters.\nGrid:\nRow0: 0000000000000\nRow1: 0000333300000\nRow2: 0033300300000\nRow3: 0030000300000\nRow4: 0030033300000\nRow5: 0033330003330\nRow6: 0000000033030\nRow7: 0000000030030\nRow8: 0000333330030\nRow9: 0000300000030\nRow10: 0000300033330\nRow11: 0000333330000\nRow12: 0000000000000\n\nOutput:\nRow0: 0000000000000\nRow1: 0000433400000\nRow2: 0043200300000\nRow3: 0030000300000\nRow4: 0030023400000\nRow5: 0043340004340\nRow6: 0000000042030\nRow7: 0000000030030\nRow8: 0000433320030\nRow9: 0000300000030\nRow10: 0000300023340\nRow11: 0000433340000\nRow12: 0000000000000\n\nObservations: The digits changed from 3 to 4 or different digits? Let's compare input and output row by row.\n\nFor example, row1 input: \"0000333300000\" -> output: \"0000433400000\". What changed? Look at digits:\n- The segment \"3333\" becomes \"4334\"? Actually, let's compare: Input row1: \"0000333300000\" has three consecutive '3's? Actually count: \"0000\" then \"333\" then \"00000\"? Let's recalc: There are 12 digits. Let's label indices:\nIndices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0, then 4:3, 5:3, 6:3, 7:3, then 8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0? Wait, there are 13 characters maybe? Let's recount: Provided \"0000333300000\" has length? Count with spaces: \"0000333300000\" I see \"0000\" (4 zeros) then \"3333\"? Actually I'll count manually:\n\"0000333300000\" characters:\n0,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0? No, let's recount carefully: They are given as strings with no commas. It might be 13 columns if not careful.\nWait, let's count e.g. row1 \"0000333300000\". Count characters:\n\"0000333300000\"\nIndices: 0 '0'\n1 '0'\n2 '0'\n3 '0'\n4 '3'\n5 '3'\n6 '3'\n7 '3'\n8 '0'\n9 '0'\n10 '0'\n11 '0'\n12 '0'\nSo length is 13 columns. But then row0 \"0000000000000\" has 13 digits? Let's count row0: \"0000000000000\": digits: positions 0 to 12, so 13 columns, if row0 has 13 digits then row1 also 13. But then row2: \"0033300300000\" count: digits: 0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0? Possibly. Let\u2019s count row2: \"0033300300000\": digits: positions: 0:0,1:0,2:3,3:3,4:3,5:0,6:0,7:3,8:0,9:0,0,0,0? Actually it's 13 digits too. So each grid is 13x13? Let's check row0: \"0000000000000\" length = 13 digits. Actually count: There are 13 digits if we count: \"0000000000000\" -> 13 zeros? Actually, \"0000000000000\" visually: if you count the groups: It might be 13 digits. But we can assume grid size is same in all rows.\n\nNow, what transformation rule is applied? We see in example 1, output digits changed from 3 to 4 sometimes, and there's a pattern: some digits remain same, some are replaced by a different digit. Let's examine rows.\n\nCompare row1 input vs output:\nInput row1: 0000333300000, output row1: 0000433400000.\nWhat changed? At index positions 4? Let's index: Let columns 0-index.\nInput row1: digits: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:3,5:3,6:3,7:3,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0.\nOutput row1: digits: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:4,5:3,6:3,7:4,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0.\nSo transformation: Four: positions that were originally '3' become either '4' or remain '3'? Actually, pattern: The block \"3333\" becomes \"4 3 3 4\". Row1: \"3333\" becomes \"4334\". But then row2 input: \"0033300300000\" maybe becomes \"0043200300000\" output.\nLet's compare row2:\nInput row2: digits: 0,0,3,3,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0.\nOutput row2: \"0043200300000\": digits: 0,0,4,3,2,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0.\nSo the block \"333\" changed to \"432\"?\nWait, what exactly? Let's align positions:\nOriginal row2: indices: 0:0,1:0,2:3,3:3,4:3,5:0,6:0,7:3,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0.\nOutput row2: indices: 0:0,1:0,2:4,3:3,4:2,5:0,6:0,7:3,8:0,...\n\nSo the first group \"333\" becomes \"432\". And row4:\nInput row4: \"0030033300000\" becomes output \"0030023400000\".\nLet's check row4: Input: 0,0,3,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0.\nOutput row4: 0,0,3,0,0,2,3,4,0,0,0,0,0.\nSo the group \"0033\" changed? Actually, let's look carefully:\nInput row4: digits: 0,0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0,0,0,0,0.\nOutput row4: digits: 0,0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 0,0,0,0,0.\nSo the substring \"333\" becomes \"234\"? Row5:\nInput row5: \"0033330003330\" becomes output: \"0043340004340\".\nLet's compare row5:\nInput row5: digits: 0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,3,3,3,0.\nOutput row5: digits: 0,0,4,3,3,4,0,0,0,4,3,4,0.\nSo group \"3333\" becomes \"4334\"? Actually, check: Input group \"3333\" at indices 2-5 becomes \"4334\"? Wait, let's align:\nInput row5: positions: 0:0,1:0, then 2:3,3:3,4:3,5:3, then 6:0,7:0,8:0, then 9:3,10:3,11:3, then 12:0.\nOutput row5: positions: 0:0,1:0, then 2:4,3:3,4:3,5:4, then 6:0,7:0,8:0, then 9:4,10:3,11:4, then 12:0.\nSo pattern: block of four 3's", "prompt_tokens": 1022, "completion_tokens": 2048}

{"task_id": "15696249", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus:free", "raw_response": "We are given several examples from ARC problems, each with different transformation rules. However, the transformation rules are not standard. We have four examples (E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, E.g. 4) and then test input grid. Let's re-read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe have: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\"\n\nThe provided examples have different transformation rules. Let's re-read each example carefully:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n```\n446\n333\n664\n```\nOutput:\n```\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n446446446\n333333333\n664664664\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n```\nObservations: The output grid is 9 rows, each row of length 9, and the input grid is 3 rows by 3. We see that the output has a vertical repetition of the input pattern in the middle three rows. The top 3 rows are all zeros, bottom 3 rows are zeros.\n\nSpecifically, the input grid is repeated along the horizontal dimension? But not exactly, let's check: In output, rows 4-6 are the same as input? Actually, row 4 is \"446446446\" which is the input row \"446\" repeated three times. Row 5 is \"333333333\" which is row \"333\" repeated three times. Row 6 is \"664664664\" which is row \"664\" repeated three times. And then rows 1-3, and 7-9 are all zeros.\n\nSo transformation rule for E.g. 1: It appears to scale the input grid by a factor of 3 in both dimensions, but the scaling is not uniform? Wait, the output grid is 9x9 and the input grid is 3x3. But the output shows zeros filling top and bottom parts. The pattern: The input grid seems to be placed in the center of the output grid, repeated horizontally thrice. But wait, let's check: The given example's input is 3 rows x 3 columns, but output is 9 rows x 9 columns, and the input pattern appears in rows 4 to 6, but also repeated horizontally three times each row. But the top 3 rows and bottom 3 rows are zeros. So the pattern of placement is: The input grid is scaled up by factor of 3 (like each cell is replaced by a 3x3 block that is a copy of the cell). But then there is a twist: The output grid is arranged such that the first three rows are all zeros, then the scaled input, then the last three rows are zeros. But wait, check E.g. 1 output: \nRows:\n1: 000000000\n2: 000000000\n3: 000000000\n4: 446446446\n5: 333333333\n6: 664664664\n7: 000000000\n8: 000000000\n9: 000000000\n\nThat is exactly 9 rows. But if we scale the 3x3 grid by factor 3, we should get 9 rows where each row is 3 copies of the input row. But then the output would be 9 rows all full, not having zeros in top and bottom. So E.g. 1 seems to be doing: \n- There is a \"ring\" or \"frame\" of some zeros, and the input grid scaled up is placed in the center of the output grid. But wait, check row count: The output grid is 9 rows. The input grid scaled up by factor 3 would normally produce 9 rows if we simply replace each cell with a 3x3 block. But here we see the top 3 rows are zeros, then middle 3 rows are the scaled input, then bottom 3 rows are zeros. That is like a 3x3 tiling: it is like a frame of zeros around the scaled grid? But that would require the output grid to be 3+3+3 = 9 rows, but if the middle block is the scaled input, then the top and bottom are filled with zeros. But then the scaled input is 3 rows high (if scaling factor is 1 then it's 3 rows, but if scaling factor 3, then it would be 9 rows). So there is confusion.\n\nLet's re-read E.g. 1 input and output carefully:\n\nInput:\nRow1: \"446\"\nRow2: \"333\"\nRow3: \"664\"\n\nOutput:\nRow1: \"000000000\"\nRow2: \"000000000\"\nRow3: \"000000000\"\nRow4: \"446446446\"\nRow5: \"333333333\"\nRow6: \"664664664\"\nRow7: \"000000000\"\nRow8: \"000000000\"\nRow9: \"000000000\"\n\nObservation: The middle three rows (4-6) are exactly the input rows repeated 3 times horizontally. The top and bottom three rows are all zeros. So what transformation did they do? It seems they are \"embedding\" the input grid into a larger grid, with a border of zeros that is three times as thick as the input grid's height? Actually, the output grid is 9 rows by 9 columns. The input grid is 3 rows by 3 columns, but it is placed exactly in the center, but not scaled by factor 3. Because if it were scaled by factor 3, it would occupy 9 rows by 9 columns. But here the input grid is not repeated, but rather each row of the input is repeated three times. That is exactly equivalent to scaling by factor 3, but then not filling the entire grid? Wait, let's check: if we take the input grid \"446\" and replicate each digit three times, we get \"446446446\", which is row 4. And similarly row5 \"333333333\", row6 \"664664664\". That is exactly the output. So the transformation is: take the input grid, replicate each row three times horizontally (each digit repeated three times) and replicate the rows three times vertically (each row repeated three times). And then pad with zeros around? But then the output grid should be 9x9, but then the output grid is entirely 9x9? But then what is the border of zeros? Actually, the border of zeros: The top three rows are zeros, but then the next three rows are the scaled input, then the bottom three rows are zeros. That is a pattern of 3 rows of zeros, then 3 rows of scaled input, then 3 rows of zeros. That means the scaling factor is not 3 for the entire grid; it is 1 for the input area plus a border of zeros of width equal to the input grid's height on each side. Essentially, the final output grid is (input_rows + 2 * input_rows) by (input_cols + 2 * input_cols) = (3+6)x(3+6) = 9x9, and the input grid is placed in the center, and each row of the input grid is repeated input_rows times when scaling. But then why are the top and bottom rows zeros? Because the border is zeros. So rule for E.g. 1: Expand the grid with a border of zeros of width equal to the grid size, then place the scaled input grid in the center? But then the middle part is not repeated; it's just the input grid replicated horizontally and vertically.\n\nWait, let's check E.g. 2:\nInput:\nRow1: \"243\"\nRow2: \"234\"\nRow3: \"234\"\nOutput:\nRow1: \"243000000\"\nRow2: \"234000000\"\nRow3: \"234000000\"\nRow4: \"243000000\"\nRow5: \"234000000\"\nRow6: \"234000000\"\nRow7: \"243000000\"\nRow8: \"234000000\"\nRow9: \"234000000\"\n\nObserving: The output has 9 rows, each row is 9 columns. The first three rows are identical to the input rows with zeros appended to the right. The next six rows are just repeats of the same pattern: row1 \"243\", then \"234\", then \"234\", then repeating that block. Actually, let's check: row1: \"243000000\", row2: \"234000000\", row3: \"234000000\", row4: \"243000000\", row5: \"234000000\", row6: \"234000000\", row7: \"243000000\", row8: \"234000000\", row9: \"234000000\". Wait, there are 9 rows, not 6. And the pattern is repeating every 3 rows? Actually, pattern: The output is 9 rows, but the first 3 rows are the input rows with appended zeros? But then row4, row5, row6 are exactly the same as row1, row2, row3 respectively? And then row7, row8, row9 are again exactly the same as row1, row2, row3 respectively. So effectively, the transformation for E.g. 2 is: take the input grid (3 rows), and then repeat it vertically to form a 9-row grid (3 times repetition vertically). And then horizontally, each row is padded with zeros to become 9 columns? But wait, input rows are 3 columns, but output rows are 9 columns, so each input digit is repeated three times horizontally.

Similarly, the output grid for E.g. 1 is also 29 lines. So grid dimensions: 29 rows x maybe 32 columns? Actually, each line length: \"000000000000000000000000000000\" is 32 digits? Let's count: 32 digits? Actually count: \"000000000000000000000000000000\" has 32 zeros. But then \"000000000000001000000000000000\" has 1 in position maybe column count. So grid size is 32 columns x ~29 rows.\n\nNow what transformation is applied? Let's compare input and output for example 1.\n\nI'll label rows by index (starting from 1). Let's compare row by row.\n\nRow 1: Input: \"000000000000000000000000000000\"\nOutput: \"000000000000000000000000000000\"\nNo changes. So first 8 rows are all zeros unchanged.\n\nRow 2: Input: \"000000000000001000000000000000\"\nOutput: \"000000000000000000000000000000\"\nSo row 2 becomes all zeros. So difference: row 2 which had a single \"1\" in column? Wait, input row2: \"000000000000001000000000000000\". Let's count columns: 32 columns. There is a \"1\" at column? Actually count: \"0000000000000010\" I see \"1\" at column? Let's count digits: 32 digits, position 15 maybe? Let's index columns from 1 to 32:\nFor row2: digits: 1,2,3,...,14 zeros, then digit 15 is \"1\", then digit 16 is \"0\", then rest zeros? But then output row2 is all zeros. So row2: changed from having a \"1\" to being all zeros. But then row 3:\nRow 3: Input: \"000000000000001100000000000000\" output: \"000000000000000000000000000000\"\nSo row 3 becomes all zeros as well, even though input row3 had \"11\" in positions. So row2 and row3 are cleared? But then row 4: Input: \"000000000000011110000000000000\" output: \"000000000000000000000000000000\" so row4 becomes all zeros? Row4 becomes all zeros? Actually check: row4 input: \"000000000000011110000000000000\", output: \"000000000000000000000000000000\". So seems like rows 2-4 in the top block become all zeros in output? But wait, then row 5 input: \"000000000000010010000000000000\" output: \"000000000000000000000000000000\" so row5 becomes zeros.\n\nThen row 6: Input: \"000000000000000000000000000000\" output: \"000000000000000000000000000000\" so row6 unchanged.\nRow 7: Input: \"000000000000000000000000000000\" output: \"000000000000000000000000000000\"\nRow 8: Input: \"000000000000000000000000000000\" output: \"000000000000000000000000000000\"\nSo then row 9: Input: \"222222222222222222222222222222\" output: \"222222222222222222222222222222\". So row9 unchanged.\nRow 10: Input \"222222222222222222222222222222\" output same.\nRow 11: same.\nRow 12: same.\nRow 13: Input: \"222222222202222222022220022222\" output: \"222222222212222222022220022222\". So row 13: difference? In input row13, digits: \"222222222202222222022220022222\". In output row13: \"222222222212222222022220022222\". So difference: In column maybe? Let's compare: \nInput row13: \"222222222202222222022220022222\"\nOutput row13: \"222222222212222222022220022222\"\nDifference: The digit at position 10 (maybe) changed from 0 to 1? Let's align carefully: \nRow13: \"2222222222 0 2222222202222002222\" Actually, let me break: It might be easier to compare digit by digit. I'll index columns from 1 to 32.\nRow13 input: \ncol1-8: \"22222222\"\ncol9-10: \"22\"? Actually, let me re-read the string: \"222222222202222222022220022222\"\nI see it might be segmented as: 2222222222 0 2222222202222002222. \nWait, let me count: Characters:\n1:2\n2:2\n3:2\n4:2\n5:2\n6:2\n7:2\n8:2\n9:2\n10:2\n11:2\n12:2\n13:2\n14:2\n15:2? Let's count manually: There are 32 characters total.\n\nBetter: I'll count digits:\n\"222222222202222222022220022222\"\nI can count groups:\n\"2222222222\" is 10 digits (all 2's),\nthen \"0\" is 11th digit,\nthen \"22222222\" might be next 8 digits: so digits 12 to 19 are \"22222222\",\nthen \"0\" is digit 20,\nthen \"2222\" digits 21-24? But then \"0\" is digit 25?

Actually check: input col4=8, output col4=8? Wait, let's check carefully:\n\nLet's index columns starting from 0:\nRow1 input: \ncol0: '0'\ncol1: '4'\ncol2: '0'\ncol3: '8'\ncol4: '0'\ncol5: '0'\ncol6: '0'\ncol7: '0'\ncol8: '0'\ncol9: '0'\ncol10: '0'\ncol11: '0'\ncol12: '0'\ncol13: '0'\ncol14: '0'\ncol15: '0'\ncol16: '0'\n\nRow1 output:\ncol0: '0'\ncol1: '4'\ncol2: '0'\ncol3: '8'\ncol4: '0'? Actually check: \"04008900070000900\"\nLet's index:\ncol0: '0'\ncol1: '4'\ncol2: '0'\ncol3: '8'\ncol4: '0'? Let's check carefully: \"04008900070000900\". I'll break it digits: \n0,4,0,8,0,8,9,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,9,0,0.\nSo mapping:\n- col0: '0'\n- col1: '4'\n- col2: '0'\n- col3: '8'\n- col4: '0'\n- col5: '8'\n- col6: '9'\n- col7: '0'\n- col8: '0'\n- col9: '0'\n- col10: '7'\n- col11: '0'\n- col12: '0'\n- col13: '0'\n- col14: '9'\n- col15: '0'\n- col16: '0'\n\nInput row1 digits: 0,4,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nDifference: The differences occur at col5 becomes 8 vs input 0, col6 becomes 9 vs input 0, col10 becomes 7 vs input 0, col14 becomes 9 vs input 0.\nSo row1 differences: columns 5,6,10,14. They are nonzero. And what's the pattern? They appear to be inserted numbers maybe coming from \"080\", \"900\", \"700\", \"900\"? Wait, not exactly.\n\nLet's check row2:\nRow2 input: \"00000900070000040\"\nBreak it: digits: 0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,0,4,0.\nRow2 output: \"00000900070000940\"\nBreak: 0,0,0,0,0,9,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,9,4,0.\nDifference: at col? Look at col? They are almost the same except col? Actually compare carefully:\nFor row2: input: \nIndices: \ncol0: 0\ncol1: 0\ncol2: 0\ncol3: 0\ncol4: 0\ncol5: 9 (both same)\ncol6: 0\ncol7: 0\ncol8: 0\ncol9: 7\ncol10: 0\ncol11: 0\ncol12: 0\ncol13: 0\ncol14: 0\ncol15: 4\ncol16: 0\nOutput row2: \ncol0: 0\ncol1: 0\ncol2: 0\ncol3: 0\ncol4: 0\ncol5: 9\ncol6: 0\ncol7: 0\ncol8: 0\ncol9: 7\ncol10: 0\ncol11: 0\ncol12: 0\ncol13: 9\ncol14: 4\ncol15: 0\ncol16: 0\nDifference: input col13 was 0, output col13 is 9, and input col14 was 0, output col14 is 4? But then col15 in input was 4 and output col15 is 0. Actually check: output row2: digits at positions:\ncol0: 0\ncol1: 0\ncol2: 0\ncol3: 0\ncol4: 0\ncol5: 9\ncol6: 0\ncol7: 0\ncol8: 0\ncol9: 7\ncol10: 0\ncol11: 0\ncol12: 0\ncol13: 9\ncol14: 4\ncol15: 0\ncol16: 0\nSo what changed: originally input had '0' at col13, '0' at col14, and '4' at col15, '0' at col16. And output: col13 becomes 9, col14 becomes 4, col15 becomes 0, col16 becomes 0. So it appears that the digits are shifted maybe from the right? It seems like a pattern: The transformation might be \"rotate\" or \"shift\" some numbers to the right by one column in some rows? But not exactly.\n\nLet's check row3:\nRow3 input: \"00000100000000000\"\n-> digits: 0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow3 output: \"00000100040000900\"\nDigits of output row3: 0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,9,0,0.\nSo differences: col9 becomes 4, col14 becomes 9 maybe? But then previously row2 had col13 become 9, col14 become 4. So row3: differences are col9 and col? Let's re-read row3 input: \"00000100000000000\", output: \"00000100040000900\". \nMapping: \ncol0-5: same \"000001\"\ncol6-8: \"000\"\ncol9: changed from 0 to 4.\ncol10-13: \"0000\"\ncol14: changed from 0 to 9.\ncol15-16: \"00\"\nSo maybe pattern: differences appear at col9, col14 in row3. Row2 differences were at col13 and col? Wait, check row2 once more: \"000", "prompt_tokens": 1124, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's analyze each example.\n\nWe have grid of size 3 x 9? Actually, each input is a grid of 3 rows and 9 columns? Actually, check digits:\nExample 1: \"555000005\" is row1, \"505050050\" row2, \"555000500\" row3. And output is \"333444999\" row repeated. So each row is 9 columns.\n\nObserving each example, it seems transformation rule might be: mapping digits: 5 -> 3, 0 -> 4 or 9? But looking at example 1:\nMapping: In input, digit '5' becomes output '3'? But then, what about zeros? They become either 4 or 9? Let's check row1: 555000005. Output: 333444999. So mapping: The first 3 digits are 5 become 3's: 3,3,3. Then next three digits (0,0,0) become 4's: 4,4,4. Then last three digits: 0,0,5? Wait, but the input row 1: \"555000005\" is 9 digits: positions: \n1:5,2:5,3:5, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:0, 8:0, 9:5? Actually check: \"555000005\" is:\npositions: \n1:5\n2:5\n3:5\n4:0\n5:0\n6:0\n7:0\n8:0\n9:5 maybe? But wait, count digits: \"555000005\" is 9 digits: It might be \"555\" then \"000\" then \"005\"? But then 3 groups of 3: group1: \"555\", group2: \"000\", group3: \"005\". But output row1: \"333444999\". Group1: \"333\", group2: \"444\", group3: \"999\". So mapping not uniform maybe transformation rule: Possibly sum of row segments? Let's check columns maybe.\n\nWait, check Example 2:\nInput: \nRow1: \"005000000\"\nRow2: \"050000050\"\nRow3: \"500555000\"\nOutput: \nRow1: \"999111444\"\nRow2: \"999111444\"\nRow3: \"999111444\"\n\nNow check groups of 3 columns? Example 1 groups: maybe each column triple is transformed? Let's try columns:\nFor Example 1, consider column groups: The grid is 3 rows x 9 columns. If we divide columns into groups of 3, that gives 3 groups. For each group, maybe we count the sum of digits? Possibly, but then the outputs are uniform across the grid? However, output is same on all rows for each group. So transformation might be column-wise transformation.\n\nLet's try to break Example 1 by columns. Columns: Group1: columns 1-3 of input:\nRow1: digits: 5,5,5, row2: 5,0,5, row3: 5,5,0.\nMaybe if we sum digits? Sum= row1: 15, row2: 10, row3: 10? Not sure.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is different: maybe it's like \"mirror\" the input grid horizontally? But the outputs look like constant patterns across rows. Output row1: \"333444999\" is repeated on each row, so transformation is applied uniformly to each row? But then each row in the input is different? Wait, let's check: Example 1 input row2 is \"505050050\", but output row2 is the same as row1 output. So the transformation is not applied row-wise (each row independently) because then row2 would be different if the transformation was applied on each row separately.\n\nMaybe the transformation is applied to the entire grid in a column-wise manner? Let's check column grouping.\n\nMaybe we check each column of the grid. There are 9 columns. They seem to be divided into 3 blocks of 3 columns, and then each block is transformed into a constant digit across rows in corresponding output block. In Example 1, block1: columns 1-3. Input columns: \nFor column1: digits: row1:5, row2:5, row3:5, so all 5's. Column2: digits: row1:5, row2:0, row3:5. Column3: digits: row1:5, row2:5, row3:0. In the output, block1 is \"333\", constant. How to get 3? Possibly using median of these digits? The median of (5,5,5) is 5, but output is 3, so not median.\n\nMaybe it's count of ones? Possibly transformation: For each block (3 columns), count the number of 5's? For block1: count of 5's? In col1: all 5's -> 3 fives. In col2: two 5's out of 3, in col3: two 5's, so maybe average is (3+2+2)/3=7/3 ~ 2.33, but output digit is 3 for block1? No.\n\nMaybe it's the minimum? For block1: min is 5? But output is 3, not 5.\n\nMaybe it's the difference between count of 5's and 0's? For block1: count of 5's = 3+2+2=7, count of 0's = 0+1+1=2, difference = 5? Not 3.\n\nMaybe it's the sum of digits? For block1: sum: col1: 5+5+5=15, col2: 5+0+5=10, col3: 5+5+0=10, total=15+10+10=35, maybe then subtract something? But output block is \"333\" which if interpreted as digit 3 repeated, how do we get 3 from 35? 35/ ? Possibly 35/ ? Unclear.\n\nMaybe it's count of corners? Let's try another idea: maybe transformation is applied column-wise but each column is replaced by a digit that is the difference between the number of 5's and 0's in that column, or maybe the difference between count of 5's and count of 0's, and then mapped to a particular symbol? Let's test: In Example 1, block1 column1: digits: 5,5,5. Count of 5's = 3, count of 0's = 0, difference = 3 which is output digit 3. Column2: digits: 5,0,5: count 5's = 2, count 0's = 1, difference = 1, but output digit is 3, not 1.\nUnless we add 2? For column2: difference = 2-? Wait, maybe it's not per column but per block of 3 columns?\n\nMaybe try block-wise: For block1 columns 1-3:\n- Column1: (5,5,5) -> maybe feature: all same? \n- Column2: (5,0,5) has one 0, two 5's.\n- Column3: (5,5,0) has one 0, two 5's.\nMaybe the rule: if there is a 0 present in the block, then output digit is lower than if all are 5's? But block1 output is 333, so it is uniform digit 3, even though column1 is all 5's. So maybe rule is: count the number of 5's that occur in the block. For block1: total count of 5's = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7. But then how do we get 3? Possibly take 7 and subtract 4 gives 3. But then check block2: columns 4-6:\nFor Example 1: columns 4-6:\nRow1: \"000\"\nRow2: \"050\"\nRow3: \"000\"? Let's re-read input row3: \"555000500\", so columns 4-6: col4:0, col5:0, col6:0 from row1 is \"000\", row2:", "prompt_tokens": 543, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Output the result: Apply the identified transformation rule to the test input grid to obtain the correct test output grid.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    0\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    2,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    2,\n    2,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    2,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    2,\n    0\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    2,\n    2,\n    2,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    2,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    2,\n    0,\n    8\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    8,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0\n  ],\n  [\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    8,\n    0,\n    2,\n    0,\n    0,\n    0,\n    2,\n    0,", "prompt_tokens": 3185, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The instructions: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule.\" We need to deduce the transformation rule from the examples and apply it to the final test input grid. We are given multiple examples mapping input grid to output grid. We need to analyze differences between input and output grids.

Actually input line13 is \"0000000000000008000008\", same as output? Wait, check: input line13: \"0000000000000008000008\", output line13: \"0000000000000008000008\"? Actually output line13: \"0000000000000008000008\" is same. Let's re-read output grid carefully line by line:\n\nOutput grid lines:\nLine1: \"0000000000000000000000\" same as input.\nLine2: \"0000000000000000000000\" same.\nLine3: \"0000888888880000000000\" same.\nLine4: \"0000800000080000000000\" same.\nLine5: \"0008802002088000000000\" differs from input line5 \"0008802000088000000000\". The difference: in line5, at position? Let's index: \"0008802000088000000000\" becomes \"0008802002088000000000\". So the digit that changed from \"0\" to \"2\" at position? Let's count: \"0008802000088000000000\": digits: indices: maybe the difference is in the substring \"200008800000000\" becomes \"200208800000000\"? Let me count carefully:\nLine5 input: \"0008802000088000000000\". \nI see \"0008802000088000000000\". \nI need to see exactly: In E.g.1 input line 5: \"0008802000088000000000\". In output line 5: \"0008802002088000000000\". So it appears that the digit \"0\" after the \"200\" becomes \"2\"? Let's count: \nFor input: \"0008802000088000000000\"\nSegment: \"0008 88200 000880000000\" maybe I'm misinterpreting.\nMaybe I should re-read the lines with spacing properly: each line is 20 characters? Actually count: \"0000000000000000000000\" is 20 zeros? Actually let's count: \"0000000000000000000000\" has 20 characters? Actually 20 is not 20? Let's count: It might be 20 characters? Actually \"0000888888880000000000\" count characters: 2 zeros, then \"088888888\", hmm I'll count: \"0000888888880000000000\" length: 2 zeros then 8 8's then 8 8's? Let's count: Actually I'll assume each line is 20 characters. But given the differences, I'll try to compare positions with indices.\n\nMaybe I'll compare each line difference.\n\nE.g.1 differences:\nLine5: input \"0008802000088000000000\" vs output \"0008802002088000000000\". The difference is in one digit changed from 0 to 2.\nLine6: input \"0008002200008000088800\" vs output \"0008002222008000088800\". The difference: \"2200008000088800\" vs \"2222008000088800\". So a block \"22000\" becomes \"22220\"? Let's check: input: \"0008002200008000088800\". Possibly breakdown: \"000800\" then \"220000\" then \"8000088800\". Output: \"000800\" then \"222200\" then \"8000088800\". So it looks like a pattern: 2's replaced? It's like the interior digits: \"22000\" becomes \"22220\". But then look at line7: input \"0008802000088008880888\" vs output \"0008802002088008880888\". Difference: again \"200008800\" becomes \"200208800\"? So same pattern: the first occurrence of \"2000\" becomes \"2002\"? But then line11: input \"0000000000000008000008\" vs output \"0000000000000008022208\". So there's a block \"8000008\" becomes \"8022208\". Line12: input \"0000000000000008000008\" vs output \"0000000000000008020208\". So \"8000008\" becomes \"8020208\". Also line13: input \"0000000000000008000008\" vs output \"0000000000000008000008\" seems same but then line14: input \"0000000000000008880888\" vs output \"0000000000000008880888\" (no change?) Actually check output line14: \"0000000000000008880888\" is same as input line14.\nLine15: input \"0000000000000000088800\" vs output \"0000000000000000088800\", no change.\nLine16: same.\n\nSo what is changed exactly? It appears that some numbers get their interior pattern altered. Possibly the transformation rule is \"highlighting\" the region that is enclosed by a certain pattern (maybe the interior of a shape) and then adding inner border squares with a different color (2) for those interior parts that are adjacent to a 0 border? But then in the E.g.2 and E.g.3, similar patterns appear.\n\nLet's compare E.g.2:\n\nE.g.2 Input:\nLine1: \"00000000000000000\" (15 characters?) Actually let's count: \"00000000000000000\" is 15 zeros.\nLine2: same line.\nLine3: same.\nLine4: \"00888888880000000\"\nLine5: \"00800000080000000\"\nLine6: \"00800000080000000\"\nLine7: \"08802200088000000\"\nLine8: \"08002000008000000\"\nLine9: \"08802200088000000\"\nLine10:\"00800000080000000\"\nLine11:\"00800000080000000\"\nLine12:\"00888888880000000\"\nLine13:\"00000000000000000\"\nLine14:\"00000000000000000\"\nLine15:\"00000000000000000\"\nLine16:\"00000000000000000\"\nLine17:\"00000000000000000\"\nLine18:\"00000000000000000\"\n\nOutput E.g.2:\nLine1: same as input.\nLine2: same.\nLine3: same.\nLine4: same.\nLine5: same.\nLine6: same.\nLine7: \"08802222088000000\" (changed from \"08802200088000000\")\nLine8: \"08002002008000000\"", "prompt_tokens": 1577, "completion_tokens": 2048}

For E.g. 2: there are 21 rows? Actually let's count: E.g. 2 Input: \"0000000000000000000500\" row length is 23? Wait, let's count: \"0000000000000000000500\" has length 23.

Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\"\n\nWe need to deduce the rule. Let's denote coordinates. Let's denote the input grid as characters '0' and '7'? Actually, digits in input are: 0,7. Actually, input grid digits are 0 and 7 in these examples. In e.g.1, we see digits: 0,7. Output grid digits are 1 and 0. So we see transformation from 0 and 7 to 1 and 0. Possibly rule: maybe if input cell is 7, then output cell becomes 1 if it has at least one neighbor that is 7? But then check: e.g.1, first row: \"0770772700007\". Output: \"111011\". How does that correspond?\n\nLet's try to see pattern: In e.g.1, input row: \"0770772700007\" (14 digits). Output row: \"111011\" (6 digits). So transformation might be: pick certain columns and convert them? Because 14 columns become 6 columns. Possibly the rule: extract the columns at indices 1,3,5,7,9,11 or something like that? Let's test: if we take every other digit from e.g.1 row, maybe? For instance, row1 input: \"0 7 7 0 7 7 2 7 0 0 0 0 7\"? Actually, let me index properly: The input row \"0770772700007\", index positions: 0: '0', 1:'7', 2:'7', 3:'0', 4:'7', 5:'7', 6:'2'? Wait, but the digits in input are only 0 and 7 in examples. But e.g.1 has a \"2\"? It says \"0770772700007\". Actually, it's \"0770772700007\". Let me re-read e.g.1 input: \"0770772700007\". Actually, it might be \"0 7 7 0 7 7 2 7 0 0 0 0 7\". But then why is there a 2? Let's check e.g.1 second row: \"7000072700770\". That row has digits: 7,0,0,0,0,7,2,7,0,0,7,7,0. So digit '2' appears also in other rows. Possibly the input digits are 0, 7, and 2. And output digits are 1 and 0. So transformation might be: treat 2 as maybe a \"center\" or \"bridge\" element?\n\nMaybe the rule: Replace 7 with 1 if it is adjacent to a 2? Or maybe the rule: count the number of 7's in some neighborhood, and then threshold?\n\nWait, maybe it's a binary transformation. Let's check e.g.1: Output \"111011\". In binary, that means: row1: 1,1,1,0,1,1. And input row: \"0770772700007\". Compare positions with transformation rule? Possibly rule: \"if the sum of the digits in the 3x3 neighborhood is odd, output 1 else 0\" but digits are 0 and 7? But then what is 2? Possibly sum mod something?\n\nLet's try: maybe the transformation rule: Count the number of 7's in the 3x3 neighborhood of each cell in the input grid, and then if count is odd then output 1, if even then output 0, but then what is the role of 2? But then note: e.g.1 output \"111011\": row1 col? Let's test: For the first cell in output, which corresponds to some central cell in input? But then how do we map coordinates? The input grid is 5x14, output is 5x6. So it might be a contraction along columns. Perhaps rule: reduce the grid by taking every odd-indexed column? The indices: Input columns 0,1,...,13, output columns 0,1,...,5 maybe correspond to input columns: 0,2,4,6,8,10? But then check: Row1 input: \"0770772700007\". If we take columns 0,2,4,6,8,10, then we get: col0: 0, col2: 7, col4: 7, col6: 2, col8: 0, col10: 0, which would yield \"077200\", not \"111011\". Alternatively, maybe take columns 1,3,5,7,9,11: then row1: col1:7, col3:0, col5:7, col7:7, col9:0, col11:0 => \"707700\", not \"111011\".\n\nMaybe it's a reduction by factor of 7/2? Wait, 14 to 6 is not an integer division.\n\nMaybe the rule is: For each cell in output, consider a 3x3 block in input, and then output 1 if the center of the block is 7, else 0? But then output pattern: e.g.1, row1 output: 111011. Let's map coordinates: Output cell (0,0) might correspond to input cell (0,?) Not sure.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is based on connectivity of 7's forming a line? Possibly rule: Replace each contiguous block of 7's with 1 and fill the gaps with 0, but then where do 2's come from? Perhaps the 2's indicate something like \"bridge\" that connects areas?\n\nWait, let's re-read examples carefully. They are ARC puzzles. Often, they involve extracting a shape or pattern from the input grid. Often, the rule is \"if a cell is 7, then output 1; if a cell is 0, output 0; if a cell is 2, then it's ambiguous\". But then how do we get 1's and 0's? In e.g.1, output: 111011. In row1: positions that are 1 correspond to input digits that are 7 except maybe one? Let's compare input row1: \"0770772700007\". If we just convert 7->1 and 0->0, then we get: 0,1,1,0,1,1,? But then digit 2 becomes what? Might be 2->? Possibly 2->? Let's try: maybe 2 becomes 0? But then row1 would be: 0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1 if we do 7->1,0->0,2->? But output is 6 digits long, not 13 digits.\n\nMaybe the transformation involves summing pairs of adjacent digits? 14 to 6 suggests maybe the output grid is computed by summing a 4x? Let's try to see pattern: e.g.1 input grid dimensions: 5 rows x 14 columns. Output grid: 5 rows x 6 columns. That means each output cell is computed", "prompt_tokens": 645, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Actually, each line is 20 characters (because \"00000000000000000000000\" is 20 zeros? Count: Actually count: \"00000000000000000000000\": count digits: It should be 20 digits if so, but \"0\"*20 would be 20 zeros. Wait, let me count: \"00000000000000000000000\" - I count: 1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:0,20:0. Yes, 20 is correct.\nSo E.g. 1 input grid is 21 rows x 20 columns, but the output E.g. 1 output grid is:\n\"2220222\" (line1)\n\"2020222\" (line2)\n\"2220222\" (line3)\n\"0000000\" (line4)\n\"2020200\" (line5)\n\"0200022\" (line6)\n\"2220200\" (line7)\n\nSo output grid has 7 rows, each row has 7 digits. So the transformation seems to be a reduction from a grid with many rows and columns to a grid with fewer rows and columns. Let's check E.g. 2: E.g. 2 Input consists of:\n\"0000000000000000000\" (line1)\n\"0000000000000000000\" (line2)\n\"0002020000022000000\" (line3)\n\"0000220000020200000\" (line4)\n\"0000020000022000000\" (line5)\n\"0000000000000000000\" (line6)\n\"0000000000000000000\" (line7)\n\"0000000000000000000\" (line8)\n\"0000000000000220000\" (line9)\n\"0000002220000020000\" (line10)\n\"0000002020000202000\" (line11)\n\"0000002220000000000\" (line12)\n\"0000000000000000000\" (line13)\n\"0000000000000000000\" (line14)\n\"0000000000000000000\" (line15)\n\"0000000000000000000\" (line16)\n\"0000000000000000000\" (line17)\n\nSo E.g. 2 input grid is 17 rows x 20 columns (or maybe 20 columns? Actually \"0000000000000000000\" is 20 characters, check: 20 digits? Actually, count: \"0000000000000000000\" -> 20 digits, yes.)\nAnd E.g. 2 output grid is:\n\"2020220\" (line1)\n\"0220202\" (line2)\n\"0020220\" (line3)\n\"0000000\" (line4)\n\"2220220\" (line5)\n\"2020020\" (line6)\n\"2220202\" (line7)\n\nSo E.g. 2 output grid is 7 rows x 7 columns.\n\nNow E.g. 3 Input:\n\"0000000000000000\" (line1)\n\"0020000000000000\" (line2)\n\"0202000020200000\" (line3)\n\"0020000002000000\" (line4)\n\"0000000022000000\" (line5)\n\"0000000000000000\" (line6)\n\"0000000000000000\" (line7)\n\"0000000000000000\" (line8)\n\"0000000000020000\" (line9)\n\"0000000000222000\" (line10)\n\"0000000000020000\" (line11)\n\"0000000000000000\" (line12)\n\"0002020000000000\" (line13)\n\"0002200000000000\" (line14)\n\"0000020000000000\" (line15)\n\"0000000000000000\" (line16)\n\"0000000000000000\" (line17)\n\nSo E.g. 3 input grid is 17 rows x 16 columns. And E.g. 3 output grid is:\n\"0200202\" (line1)\n\"2020020\" (line2)\n\"0200220\" (line3)\n\"0000000\" (line4)\n\"2020020\" (line5)\n\"2200222\" (line6)\n\"0020020\" (line7)\n\nSo across examples, input grids vary in size, but output is always 7x7. So the transformation rule seems to map an input grid (of various sizes) to a 7x7 grid. The rule might be selecting certain rows and columns from the input, or maybe computing differences.\n\nObservations:\n- In E.g. 1, input has 21 rows x 20 columns, output is 7 rows x 7 columns.\n- E.g. 2, input has 17 rows x 20 columns, output is 7 rows x 7 columns.\n- E.g. 3, input has 17 rows x 16 columns, output is 7 rows x 7 columns.\n\nSo the output grid always has 7 rows and 7 columns. Where do these come from? Possibly the transformation might be \"take submatrix\" with indices that are multiples of 3 maybe? Let's check: For E.g. 1, input grid dimensions: 21 rows, 20 columns. 21/3 = 7 rows, 20/3 \u2248 6.67, not integer. But maybe columns: 7 columns if we take every 3rd column starting from", "prompt_tokens": 1086, "completion_tokens": 2048}

But what is the transformation rule? The examples output are numbers like \"20\" then \"03\". But what does that represent? They might represent the coordinates of some pattern, or might represent counts of something. Let's analyze the examples.\n\nObserving E.g. 1:\n\nInput grid is a rectangular grid of characters (digits) with width = 15 characters? Actually, count digits: \"000000000000000\" is 15 zeros. So grid is 13 rows x 15 columns. But then output is \"20\" then \"03\". That might be like a pair of numbers? Possibly they represent the row and column indices of a special cell? Let's see if we can find a pattern.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule extracts the location of the number that is different from the background? The background appears to be \"0\". And the numbers \"8\", \"2\", \"3\", \"1\", \"3\", \"8\", \"8\", \"8\", \"8\", etc are drawn inside a border of zeros. So it might be that the transformation extracts the coordinates of the first non-zero cell encountered when scanning from top-left in some order. But then E.g. 1 output is \"20\" then \"03\". That might represent coordinates in a different coordinate system? Possibly the transformation rule involves counting something.\n\nLet's check E.g. 1: The grid has \"8\" in many places. There's a pattern: There is an \"8\" region in the middle. But then there are some cells that are \"2\" or \"3\". Where do they appear? Look at the grid rows:\n\nRow1: all zeros.\nRow2: \"008888888800000\". So the region of \"8\" begins at column2? Actually, the grid has leading zeros. Let's index columns from 0 to 14. Row2: positions 2-10 are 8? Actually, let me count: \"008888888800000\" - The first two characters are \"00\", then \"8\" repeated? Let's count: There are 2 zeros then maybe 8 repeated? Actually, count digits: \"00\" then \"8888888800\" then \"0000\"? Wait, let's count carefully: \"008888888800000\". Counting: there are 2 zeros, then digits: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8? Let's count manually: It says \"00\" then \"8888888800\" then \"0000\"? Hmm, let's count length: 15 characters total. If we index from 0 to 14, then row2: characters:\nindex: \n0:0, 1:0, 2:8, 3:8, 4:8, 5:8, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8, 10:8? Wait, need to count properly. The string \"008888888800000\" has 15 characters. I'll count: characters: \n- first two: \"00\"\n- next eight? Actually, let me try: \"00\" then \"88888888\" gives 10 characters, then \"00\" gives 12, then \"0000\" gives 16, that's too many. Let's re-read: It is given as 15 characters? But \"000000000000000\" is 15 zeros, so yes, each line is 15 characters.\nSo row2: \"008888888800000\" should be 15 characters. Let's count: \n0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0. That means there are 2 zeros, then 8 repeated? Let's count: after two zeros, we have digits: 8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8? That would be 9 eights? Because 2 + 9 = 11, then plus 4 zeros = 15. So row2 has 9 eights.\nRow3: \"008228888800000\": that's 0,0,8,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0,0. So row3: The pattern \"8,2,2\" appears in the middle.\nRow4: \"008228888800000\": same.\nRow5: \"008888888800000\": same as row2.\nRow6: \"008888888800000\": same as row2.\nRow7: \"008888833800000\": so row7: 0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,0,0,0,0.\nRow8: \"008888833800000\": same.\nRow9: \"008888888800000\": same as row2.\n\nSo the grid has a \"frame\" of zeros around a central block of \"8\" with modifications in row3,4,7,8. And then rows 10-13 are zeros.\n\nNow what are the outputs? \"20\" then \"03\". They are two numbers. Possibly they represent the coordinates (row, column) of the \"special\" digit that is not the majority? But then which digit? Possibly the transformation rule extracts the bounding box coordinates of the non-zero region? But then bounding box of non-zero region in e.g. 1: The non-zero region appears to span rows 2 through 9, and columns? Let's check: The first non-zero element is at row2, col2?

The output is a single digit. Possibly the transformation rule is to count something or find a particular digit that appears in a pattern.\n\nLet's check E.g. 1: Input grid is 8 rows by 9 columns? Actually, let's count: E.g. 1 input lines: \"022000080000\" is 12 characters? Let's count: \"022000080000\" count digits: 0,2,2,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0. So it's 12 columns. And there are 8 rows. So grid is 8x12. Output is \"6\". E.g. 2: grid is 9 rows by 10 columns? Let's count: \"00044000800\" is 10 digits. And output is \"8\". E.g. 3: grid is 11 rows by 10 columns? Let's count: \"02206008800\" is 10 digits. And output is \"6\". E.g. 4: grid is 11 rows by 12 columns? Let's count: \"000033005000\" is 12 digits. And output is \"1\". E.g. 5: grid is 3 rows by 3 columns. Output is \"3\".\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is to count the number of \"holes\" or something? Alternatively, maybe it's to count the number of distinct digits? But outputs are 6,8,6,1,3. They are not counts of digits.\n\nMaybe it's to count the number of \"1\"s? Let's check E.g. 1: Count digits \"1\"? There are none. So not that.\n\nMaybe it's to count the number of \"0\"s? But then E.g. 1: count zeros? There are many zeros. But output is 6, which is not equal to count zeros.\n\nMaybe it's to count the number of \"2\"s? E.g. 1: count \"2\"s: In first row \"022000080000\", there are two 2's. But output is 6, not 2.\n\nMaybe it's to count the number of \"3\"s? E.g. 1: count \"3\"s: In row 3 \"322333383333\", count \"3\"s: digits: 3,2,2,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3. That is 8 occurrences of 3? But output is 6.\n\nMaybe it's to count the number of \"6\"s? E.g. 1: count \"6\"s: In row 6 \"666666666666\", count is 12. But output is 6.\n\nMaybe it's to count the number of \"8\"s? E.g. 1: count \"8\"s: In row 3 \"322333383333\", count \"8\" is 1? But output is 6.\n\nMaybe it's to count the number of \"4\"s? E.g. 1: count \"4\"s: none.\n\nMaybe it's to count the number of \"0\"s in some pattern? Alternatively, maybe it's to count the number of \"1\"s in some pattern? E.g. 5: grid:\n010\n333\n010\nCount \"1\"s: row1: \"010\" has one \"1\". row2: \"333\" has zero \"1\"s, row3: \"010\" has one \"1\". Total 2, but output is 3. So not that.\n\nMaybe it's to count the number of \"3\"s in E.g. 5: row1: \"010\" has 0, row2: \"333\" has 3, row3: \"010\" has 0, total 3. That matches output. But then check E.g. 1: count \"3\"s: row1: \"022000080000\" has 0, row2: \"022000080000\" has 0, row3: \"322333383333\" has digits: 3,2,2,3,3,3,3,8,3,3,3,3. That is 8 occurrences of 3. row4: same as row3, so 8 occurrences. row5: \"022000080000\" has 0, row6: \"666666666666\" has 0, row7: \"022000080000\" has 0, row8: \"022000080000\" has 0. Total count of 3's = 8+8 = 16, but output is 6. So not that.\n\nMaybe it's to count the number of \"6\"s in E.g. 1: row6: \"666666666666\" has 12 sixes, but output is 6. So maybe it's half of that? But then E.g. 2: count \"6\"s: row6: \"66666666866\" has maybe 10 sixes? Let's count: \"66666666866\": digits: 6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6. That's 9 sixes? Actually count: positions: 1:6,2:6,3:6,4:6,5:6,6:6,7:6,8:8,9:6,10:6. So count of 6's = 9. But output is 8. Not that.\n\nMaybe it's to count the number of \"8\"s in E.g. 2: row? Let's count \"8\"s: row1: \"00044000800\": digits: 0,0,0,4,4,0,0,8,0,0. So one 8. row2: same, one 8. row3: \"33344333833\": digits: 3,3,3,4,4,3,3,3,8,3,3. So one 8. row4: \"00044000800\": one 8. row5: \"00044000800\": one 8. row6: \"66666666866\": digits: 6,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,6,6. So one 8. row7: \"66666666866\": one 8. row8: \"00044000800\": one 8. row9: \"00044000800\": one 8. Total count of 8's = 1*9 = 9, but output is 8. So not that.\n\nMaybe it's to count the number of \"4\"s? E.g. 2: count \"4\"s: row1: \"00044000800\": digits: 0,0,0,4,4,0,0,8,0,0. So two 4's. row2: same, two 4's. row3: \"33344333833\": digits: 3,3,3,4,4,3,3,3,8,3,3. So two 4's. row4: \"00044000800\": two 4's. row5: \"00044000800\": two 4's. row6: \"66666666866\": no 4's. row7: \"66666666866\": no 4's. row8: \"00044000800\": two 4's. row9: \"00044000800\": two 4's. Total count of 4's = 2+2+2+2+", "prompt_tokens": 726, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" There is a puzzle.\n\nWe are given three examples. They are described as \"E.g. 1\", \"E.g. 2\", \"E.g. 3\", with input and output. And then there is a \"Test Input\" grid at the bottom. The transformation rule is hidden. We need to deduce the transformation rule from the examples, then apply to the test input grid.\n\nHowever, the provided examples are really long. Let's re-read the problem statement carefully.\n\nWe have \"E.g. 1 Input:\" and then lines, then \"E.g. 1 Output:\" and lines. There are many lines. Then \"E.g. 2 Input:\" and \"E.g. 2 Output:\" and \"E.g. 3 Input:\" and \"E.g. 3 Output:\".\n\nThen \"Test Input:\" and a grid.\n\nWait, but the provided examples are not typical ARC examples. They are very long strings. They might be intended to be puzzles that use the same transformation rule.\n\nThe examples: There are three examples, they are provided as inputs and outputs. They are quite different in structure? Let's check them.\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n5308060000000\n0888888888004\n0840000008090\n7800600758483\n2842000808000\n0891960008007\n1800008008000\n0800004048000\n0888888888000\n0000078060003\n5030000000000\n0094006077777\n0022400070007\n8803000170847\n7000050570687\n0070060077777\n3000010200002\n0001000400091\n0008086000001\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n4000000\n0060075\n4200080\n9196000\n0000800\n0000404\n\nSo example 1 input has 20 lines, each 16 digits long? Wait, let's check: The first input line \"5308060000000\" has length 13? Actually count: \"5308060000000\" is 13 digits? Let\u2019s count: 5,3,0,8,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Actually count: \"5308060000000\" - that is 13 characters. Next \"0888888888004\" is 14 characters? Wait, check: \"0888888888004\": count = 1:0, 2:8, 3:8, 4:8, 5:8, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8, 10:8, 11:0, 12:0, 13:0, 14:4. So the lines have variable lengths? Might be a formatting issue. Possibly each example's input grid is not a square, but a \"puzzle\" where the output grid is a 6x6 grid for example 1. Let's check length of first output line: \"4000000\" is 7 characters. Second line \"0060075\" is 7. Third \"4200080\", etc. So output grid is 6 rows, 7 columns? Meanwhile, input grid was 20 rows, each row length different? They might be puzzles where the output is a submatrix extracted from the input grid? But the numbers in input are not contiguous digits? They might represent some kind of transformation.\n\nAlternatively, the examples might be different puzzles from ARC, which are known to have hidden rules. ARC tasks are usually solved with pattern identification. But here, the transformation rule is not trivial.\n\nLet's try to analyze the examples carefully.\n\nWe have three examples. They are labeled \"E.g. 1\", \"E.g. 2\", \"E.g. 3\". They are provided as sample puzzles, each with an input grid and output grid. We need to deduce a rule that transforms an input grid into an output grid. Then apply that rule to the test input grid.\n\nObserving the examples, we see that the output grids are smaller than the input grids. Also, the provided digits in input are 0-9. Possibly they are images with colored squares. But the digits might represent colors (or numbers). Transformation rule might be something like \"take the border of the input, extract contour, or sum digits along diagonals, etc.\" But we need to look at structure.\n\nLet's inspect E.g. 1 details.\n\nE.g. 1 Input: It has 20 rows. Let's list them with row numbers:\n\nRow0: \"5308060000000\"\nRow1: \"0888888888004\"\nRow2: \"0840000008090\"\nRow3: \"7800600758483\"\nRow4: \"2842000808000\"\nRow5: \"0891960008007\"\nRow6: \"1800008008000\"\nRow7: \"0800004048000\"\nRow8: \"0888888888000\"\nRow9: \"0000078060003\"\nRow10: \"5030000000000\"\nRow11: \"0094006077777\"\nRow12: \"0022400070007\"\nRow13: \"8803000170847\"\nRow14: \"7000050570687\"\nRow15: \"0070060077777\"\nRow16: \"3000010200002\"\nRow17: \"0001000400091\"\nRow18: \"0008086000001\"\n\nWe have 19 rows? Let's count: Actually, count indices: \nRow0: \"5308060000000\"\nRow1: \"0888888888004\"\nRow2: \"0840000008090\"\nRow3: \"7800600758483\"\nRow4: \"2842000808000\"\nRow5: \"0891960008007\"\nRow6: \"1800008008000\"\nRow7: \"0800004048000\"\nRow8: \"0888888888000\"\nRow9: \"0000078060003\"\nRow10:\"5030000000000\"\nRow11:\"0094006077777\"\nRow12:\"0022400070007\"\nRow13:\"8803000170847\"\nRow14:\"7000050570687\"\nRow15:\"0070060077777\"\nRow16:\"3000010200002\"\nRow17:\"0001000400091\"\nRow18:\"0008086000001\"\nThat makes 19 rows total.\n\nE.g. 1 Output: 6 rows, each row of length varying: \nRow0: \"4000000\" (7 digits)\nRow1: \"0060075\" (7 digits)\nRow2: \"4200080\" (7 digits)\nRow3: \"9196000\" (7 digits)\nRow4: \"0000800\" (7 digits)\nRow5: \"0000404\" (7 digits)\n\nMaybe rule: the output grid is a reduced version where each cell is computed from the input grid's border? Possibly taking the outer frame? But the output grid size is 6x7, which is much smaller than 19x? The input grid might be 19 rows by maybe variable width columns. Check maximum length: row0: 13 chars, row1: 14, row2: 14, row3: 16, row4: 16, row5: 16, row6: 16, row7: 16, row8: 16, row9: 16, row10: 16, row11: 16, row12: 16, row13: 16, row14: 16, row15: 16, row16: 16, row17: 16, row18: 16. So input grid is a rectangle of 19 rows and 16 columns (for rows 3 onward, but first two rows are shorter, but maybe they are padded to 16? Unclear).\n\nOutput grid is 6 rows x 7 columns. The transformation might be \"extract the corners\" or \"compute differences\" or \"apply some filter\".\n\nMaybe we try to see pattern by comparing corresponding positions in input and output.\n\nMaybe the rule: \"read the grid along diagonals\" or \"compute sums of four corners\"?\n\nWait, maybe we can try to see if the output grid is like a \"blurring\" or \"edge detection\" of the input grid. For instance, look at the first output row \"4000000\". It might be derived from row? Possibly from the first row of the input? But first input row \"5308060000000\": if we take some digits? 5,3,0,8,0,6,... not matching \"4000000\" exactly.\n\nMaybe the rule: \"Replace each digit with the difference between it and the next digit\" but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation rule is \"Take the input grid, then extract the digits in the positions that are colored (non-zero?)\". Wait, note that many digits in input are zeros. In output, we see digits like 4,0, etc. Possibly the rule is \"Find the border of non-zero cells and then shift them to a smaller grid\". But then example 2 and 3 might indicate similar structure.\n\nLet's check Example 2.\n\nE.g. 2 Input: There are 26 rows? Let's count:\nRow0: \"03090009504000050004080\" (length? count digits: \"03090009504000050004080\" count: 23", "prompt_tokens": 1246, "completion_tokens": 2048}

They appear to be 12 rows \u00d7 12 columns? Wait, let's check: The examples: They are \"E.g.1\" etc. They show grids with 12 rows. Actually, check: E.g. 1 input: There are 12 lines? Let's count: Provided lines: \"000000000000\", \"000000000000\", \"000000000000\", \"000000000000\", \"000001111000\", \"000001001000\", \"111111001111\", \"000000000000\", \"000050000000\", \"055050000000\", \"055050000000\", \"000000000000\". So 12 rows. And columns: 12 columns. Similarly, outputs are same shape.\n\nWe are asked: \"Hidden Transformation Rule\" that seems to be applied on some parts of the grid. Let's analyze differences between input and output for each example.\n\nLet's denote the examples:\n\nE.g.1:\nInput:\nRow 1: \"000000000000\"\nRow 2: \"000000000000\"\nRow 3: \"000000000000\"\nRow 4: \"000000000000\"\nRow 5: \"000001111000\"\nRow 6: \"000001001000\"\nRow 7: \"111111001111\"\nRow 8: \"000000000000\"\nRow 9: \"000050000000\"\nRow 10: \"055050000000\"\nRow 11: \"055050000000\"\nRow 12: \"000000000000\"\n\nOutput:\nRow 1: \"000000000000\"\nRow 2: \"000000000000\"\nRow 3: \"000000000000\"\nRow 4: \"000000000000\"\nRow 5: \"000001111000\"\nRow 6: \"000001001000\"\nRow 7: \"111111001111\"\nRow 8: \"000000000000\"\nRow 9: \"000050000000\"\nRow 10: \"022050000000\"\nRow 11: \"022050000000\"\nRow 12: \"000000000000\"\n\nDifference is in last rows: row 10 and row 11. In input row 10: \"055050000000\" becomes output: \"022050000000\". Similarly, row 11 same.\n\nLet's compare row 10 digits: input row 10: \"055050000000\"\n- digits: index positions (0-indexed) columns: \n0: '0'\n1: '5'\n2: '5'\n3: '0'\n4: '5'\n5: '0'\n6: '0'\n7: '0'\n8: '0'\n9: '0'\n10: '0'\n11: '0'\nOutput row 10: \"022050000000\"\n- digits: 0,2,2,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\nSo the difference: digits at positions 1 and 2 changed from '5' to '2'? Actually wait: originally row 10, columns: 1: '5', 2: '5'. In output, columns 1 and 2 become '2'? Wait check: Actually row 10: \"055050000000\" vs \"022050000000\" means:\n- col0: '0' same,\n- col1: '5' changed to '2'\n- col2: '5' changed to '2'\n- col3: '0' remains\n- col4: '5' remains,\n- col5: '0' remains, etc.\n\nWait, but then row 11 is identical: \"055050000000\" -> \"022050000000\". So the transformation rule applied to these rows?\n\nMaybe check e.g.2:\nE.g.2 input:\nRows: \nRow 1: \"000000000000\"\nRow 2: \"000111100000\"\nRow 3: \"000100100000\"\nRow 4: \"111100111111\"\nRow 5: \"000000000000\"\nRow 6: \"000000000000\"\nRow 7: \"000000000000\"\nRow 8: \"000000000000\"\nRow 9: \"000000005000\"\nRow 10: \"055505505500\"\nRow 11: \"055005500500\"\nRow 12: \"000000000000\"\nOutput:\nRow 1: \"000000000000\"\nRow 2: \"000111100000\"\nRow 3: \"000100100000\"\nRow 4: \"111100111111\"\nRow 5: \"000000000000\"\nRow 6: \"000000000000\"\nRow 7: \"000000000000\"\nRow 8: \"000000000000\"\nRow 9: \"000000005000\"\nRow 10: \"022202205500\"\nRow 11: \"022002200500\"\nRow 12: \"000000000000\"\n\nLet's check row 10 difference:\nInput row 10: \"055505505500\"\nOutput row 10: \"022202205500\"\nMapping:\n- col0: '0' same\n- col1: '5' -> '2'\n- col2: '5' -> '2'\n- col3: '5' -> '2'? Actually check: \nInput row10: \"055505505500\"\nLet's index columns with digits:\n0:0, 1:5, 2:5, 3:5, 4:0, 5:5, 6:5, 7:0, 8:5, 9:5, 10:0, 11:0? Wait, let's check carefully: \"055505505500\" I need to count: There are 12 characters.\nIt is \"0\", \"5\", \"5\", \"5\", \"0\", \"5\", \"5\", \"0\", \"5\", \"5\", \"0\", \"0\". Now output row10: \"022202205500\" digits: \"0\", \"2\", \"2\", \"2\", \"0\", \"2\", \"2\", \"2\", \"0\", \"5\", \"0\", \"0\". So mapping column by column:\ncol0: 0->0\ncol1: 5->2\ncol2: 5->2\ncol3: 5->2\ncol4: 0->0\ncol5: 5->2\ncol6: 5->2\ncol7: 0->2? Actually output row10 col7 is \"2\"? Wait recalc row10 output: \"022202205500\". Let\u2019s index:\ncol0: 0\ncol1: 2\ncol2: 2\ncol3: 2\ncol4: 0\ncol5: 2\ncol6: 2\ncol7: 2\ncol8: 0\ncol9: 5\ncol10: 0\ncol11: 0\nSo comparing:\ncol7: Input row10: char at col7 = from \"055505505500\", indexing: characters: \nIndex: 0: '0'\n1: '5'\n2: '5'\n3: '5'\n4: '0'\n5: '5'\n6: '5'\n7: '0'\n8: '5'\n9: '5'\n10: '0'\n11: '0'\nSo col7: '0' becomes '2'\ncol8: Input: '5' becomes output: '0'\ncol9: Input: '5' becomes output: '5'? Wait check: col9: input row10: char '5' but output row10: char at col9 is '5'? Actually output row10 col9 is '5'? Let's recalc: \"022202205500\": digits by index: \n0: '0'\n1: '2'\n2: '2'\n3: '2'\n4: '0'\n5: '2'\n6: '2'\n7: '2'\n8: '0'\n9: '5'\n10: '0'\n11: '0'\nSo col9: input '5' remains '5'? That is strange. Let's check row 11:\nInput row 11: \"055005500500\"\nOutput row 11: \"022002200500\"\nMapping:\ncol0: 0->0\ncol1: 5->2\ncol2: 5->2\ncol3: 0->0\ncol4: 0->0? Actually input row11 col4: '0' remains '0'? But then output row11 col4: '0'? Wait, check: input row11: \"0\",\"5\",\"5\",\"0\",\"0\",\"5\",\"5\",\"0\",\"0\",\"5\",\"0\",\"0\". Output row11: \"0\",\"2\",\"2\",\"0\",\"0\",\"2\",\"2\",\"0\",\"0\",\"5\",\"0\",\"0\". So differences: columns 1,2 become 2, then column 5 becomes 2, column 6 becomes 2? Wait, let's map properly:\nRow 11 input: digits: index:\n0: '0'\n1: '5'\n2: '5'\n3: '0'\n4: '0'\n5: '5'\n6: '5'\n7: '0'\n8: '0'\n9: '5'\n10: '0'\n11: '0'\nOutput row11: digits:\n0: '0'\n1: '2'\n2: '2'\n3: '0'\n4: '0'\n5: '2", "prompt_tokens": 975, "completion_tokens": 2048}

But then what is the significance of \"2\"? Wait, let's see: In the input grid, row4: \"000255555555500\". In output grid, row4: \"000222222555500\". So what changed? The pattern \"2\" replaced by \"222222\"? Actually, let's analyze each non-zero cell. The transformation appears to be replacing certain digits with other digits? Looking at row4: Input \"000255555555500\". The left part \"00\" unchanged. Then \"2\" becomes \"222222\"? Wait, check carefully:\n\nInput row4: \"000255555555500\". In output row4: \"000222222555500\". So what happened? The \"2\" at index 3? Wait, let's index positions in row4: possibly positions: \"0,0,0,2,5,5,5,5,...\". But output row4: \"0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,2,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0\"? Let's count digits: Each row is 15 digits? Actually, counting: The input row might be 15 columns? Wait, count: \"000255555555500\" has length 15 digits.\n\nLet's index positions: columns: 1:0,2:0,3:0,4:2,5:5,6:5,7:5,8:5,9:5,10:5,11:5,12:5,13:5,14:0,15:0. Similarly, output row4: \"000222222555500\": digits: col1:0,2:0,3:0,4:2,5:2,6:2,7:2,8:2,9:2,10:2,11:5,12:5,13:5,14:0,15:0. So the transformation in row4: The segment starting at col4 to col9 (6 digits?) Actually, count indices: Input: col4: '2'; col5-11: '5555555'? Actually, let's re-read row4 input: \"000255555555500\". It looks like there is \"2\" then \"5555555\" then \"500\" at end. But output row4: \"000222222555500\". So what changed? The \"2\" became \"2\", but then the following \"5555555\" became \"222222\"? Actually, that's not consistent with row5: row5 input is \"000555555555500\" and output row5 is \"000222222555500\". So in row5, there is no initial \"2\", but output row5 has changed to start with \"222222\"? Let's check row5 input: \"000555555555500\". Output row5: \"000222222555500\". So the transformation is not simply replacing digits.\n\nWait, what pattern? Look at E.g. 1: There are two distinct regions: upper part and lower part. The top part (rows 4 to 10) become all \"222222\" in a contiguous block in the middle? And then rows 11 to 13 remain unchanged (\"555555555500\"). And also row3 is blanked out. And row2, row1, row14, row15 remain unchanged. So perhaps the transformation is: Identify the region bounded by certain shapes? Perhaps \"2\" is a marker and \"5\" is another marker. Let's look at differences: In input, we see a \"2\" at row3 col? \"000000002000000\": There is a \"2\" at col? Actually, row3 input: \"000000002000000\". Output row3: \"000000000000000\" (all zeros). So that \"2\" seems to vanish. In row4, the input has \"2\" at col4 and then a bunch of \"5\"s, output becomes \"222222\" then \"555500\". In row5, input \"000555555555500\", output becomes \"000222222555500\". So the pattern: The region that originally contained \"5\"s in some rows is replaced by a block of \"2\"s in a particular shape? And then the region that was originally \"5\" becomes a block of \"2\" in some rows? Let's check row6: input: \"000555555555500\". Output row6: \"000222222555500\". Row7, row8, row9, row10: same transformation. Then row11: input remains \"000555555555500\", output remains \"000555555555500\". So the transformation seems to occur on rows 4-10, but only partially. In these rows, the left 3 columns are zeros (unchanged), then the next 6 columns become \"222222\", then the next 5 columns become \"555500\"? Let's check: row4 output: \"000222222555500\". Count: 3 zeros, then 6 \"2\"s, then 5 \"5\"s, then \"00\"? Actually, \"555500\" has 6 digits? Let's re-count: \"000222222555500\" digits: 3 zeros, then \"222222\" is 6 digits, then \"555500\" is 6 digits? But our grid is 15 digits, so 3+6+6 =15. Row5: \"000222222555500\". Row6: \"000222222555500\". Row7: \"000222222555500\". Row8: \"000222222555500\". Row9: \"000222222555500\". Row10: \"000222222555500\". And then row11: remains \"000555555555500\" (which is 3 zeros, then 12 digits \"555555555555\" then maybe two zeros? Wait, count row11: \"000555555555500\" is 3 zeros, then \"555555555555\" is 12? Actually, wait, I'm counting digits incorrectly: Let's count row11 input: \"000555555555500\" is 15 digits if we consider 3 zeros, then 9 fives? Let's count: \"000\" = 3, then \"555555555\" would be 9 fives, then \"500\" is 3 digits, total 3+9+3=15. But output row11: \"000555555555500\" is same. So the transformation affects rows 4-10 in the middle block. The transformation seems to be: Change some digits from \"5\" to \"2\" in a contiguous block. But then row4 input had a \"2\" at col4 originally, but then it got replaced by a block of \"2\"s from col4 to col9. And row5 input had no \"2\" at the left of the block, but output gets \"222222\" in col4-col9.\n\nMaybe the rule is: In the input grid, there are two groups of connected regions that are separated by a border.

Problem is from ARC tasks. The input and output examples are given lines of grids. The problem asks: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\"\n\nWe are given several examples. Let's re-read the provided examples. There are three training examples - \"E.g. 1\", \"E.g. 2\", and \"E.g. 3\", and then a test input grid.\n\nWe want to determine the transformation rule from these examples. Let's inspect the provided examples:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n```\n0000000000000\n0808080008800\n0808008000800\n0888088800880\n0000000000000\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0000000000000\n0020002200020\n0020020202020\n0000000002000\n0000000000000\n```\nObserving the transformations.\n\nWe have an input grid and an output grid. Dimensions: The input grid is 5 rows by 13 columns? Wait, let's count columns in example 1. The first line \"0000000000000\" contains 13 zeros? Actually count: \"0000000000000\" - count characters: 13 digits? Let's count: There are 13 digits? Actually \"0000000000000\" is 13 characters? Wait, check: \"0000000000000\" - count: 13 characters. But then \"0808080008800\" is 13 characters. So it's possibly 13 columns (maybe width=13) and rows count = 5 rows? But then output grid: \"0000000000000\" is 13 zeros? Wait, but then \"0020002200020\" is 13 digits. So grid size is 5 x 13. But then example 2: The first line \"0000000000000\" is 13 digits, but then second line \"0808080808000\" has 14 digits? Wait, count: \"0808080808000\" count digits: 14? Let's count: \"0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0\" That's 14. So maybe different examples have different dimensions. Let's re-read carefully.\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nLine1: \"0000000000000\" -> 13 digits (0 to 12). \nLine2: \"0808080008800\" -> count: digits: \"0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 8 8 0 0\". Yes 13 digits.\nLine3: \"0808008000800\" -> 13 digits.\nLine4: \"0888088800880\" -> 13 digits.\nLine5: \"0000000000000\" -> 13 digits.\nOutput:\nLine1: \"0000000000000\" -> 13 digits.\nLine2: \"0020002200020\" -> 13 digits.\nLine3: \"0020020202020\" -> 13 digits.\nLine4: \"0000000002000\" -> 13 digits.\nLine5: \"0000000000000\" -> 13 digits.\n\nSo e.g.1 grid is 5x13.\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\nLine1: \"0000000000000\" -> 13 digits.\nLine2: \"0808080808000\" -> count digits: \"0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0\" -> 14 digits? Let's count: Actually: \"0000000000000\" is 13 digits? Wait, check: \"0000000000000\" length: if it's 12? Let's recount: \"0000000000000\" might be 12 zeros? But then \"0808080808000\" seems to have 14 digits maybe?\nWait, let's count manually:\n\"0000000000000\": Count zeros: It might be 13 zeros if I count: \"0000000000000\" -> how many 0's? I can count: group them in 3's: \"000\" then \"000\" then \"000\" then \"000\"? That would be 12. Let's count precisely: \"0000000000000\" length = 13? I'll count index positions: positions: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. So 13 characters. So e.g.2 line1 is 13 characters.\nLine2 of e.g.2: \"0808080808000\": count digits: There are maybe 14 digits? Let's count: characters: '0' (1), '8' (2), '0' (3), '8' (4), '0' (5), '8' (6), '0' (7), '8' (8), '0' (9), '8' (10), '0' (11), '0' (12), '0' (13), '0' (14). So length=14.\nLine3: \"0080088808800\": count digits: length 14.\nLine4: \"0808080800880\": count digits: length 14.\nLine5: \"0000000000000\": length=13? But then line6: \"0888088808800\": length 14 maybe.\nLine7: \"0808000000080\": length=14 maybe.\nLine8: \"0080088808800\": length=14.\nLine9: \"0000000000000\": length=13\nOutput for e.g.2:\nLine1: \"0000000000000\": length 13.\nLine2: \"0020002000220\": length 13? Let's count: \"0020002000220\": count digits: should be 13 maybe, but let's count: digits: 0,0,2,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,2,2,0 -> 13 digits.\nLine3: \"0202000000020\": length 13.\nLine4: \"0020002002000\": length 13.\nLine5: \"0000000000000\": length 13.\nLine6: \"0000000000020\": length 13.\nLine7: \"0020022202200\": length 13.\nLine8: \"0202000000020\": length 13.\nLine9: \"0000000000000\": length 13.\n\nSo e.g.2 input grid seems to have 9 rows, but some rows are 13 and some rows are 14. Possibly the grid dimensions vary. Let\u2019s check e.g.3:\nE.g. 3 Input:\nLine1: \"000000000\" -> 9 digits.\nLine2: \"088808080\" -> 9 digits.\nLine3: \"000000880\" -> 9 digits.\nLine4: \"008008080\" -> 9 digits.\nLine5: \"000000000\" -> 9 digits.\nLine6: \"088008000\" -> 9 digits.\nLine7: \"008808880\" -> 9 digits.\nLine8: \"080000800\" -> 9 digits.\nLine9: \"000000000\" -> 9 digits.\nOutput:\nLine1: \"000000000\"\nLine2: \"000000200\"\nLine3: \"022202000\"\nLine4: \"020200200\"\nLine5: \"000000000\"\nLine6: \"000200220\"\nLine7: \"020000000\"\nLine8: \"002202020\"\nLine9: \"000000000\"\nSo e.g.3 grid is 9x9.\n\nTest Input has:\nTest Input:\nLine1: \"0000000000000\" (13 digits) \nLine2: \"0800080800800\" (13 digits)\nLine3: \"0808088800880\" (13 digits)\nLine4: \"0888080008080\" (13 digits)\nLine5: \"0000000000000\" (13 digits)\nLine6: \"0808080008880\" (13 digits)\nLine7: \"0888008008080\" (13 digits)\nLine8: \"0088080800800\" (13 digits)\nLine9: \"0000000000000\" (13 digits)\nLine10: \"0888080800080\" (13 digits)\nLine11: \"0880088008880\" (13 digits)\nLine12: \"0080008808000\" (13 digits)\nLine13: \"0000000000000\" (13 digits)\n\nSo test input grid is 13 rows x 13 columns.\n\nI need to deduce transformation rule from examples. Let me denote grid cells by coordinates. I need to inspect patterns in transformation from input to output.\n\nObserving e.g.1: There is a pattern: In the input grid, there are some numbers \"0\" and \"8\" and possibly \"0\"?

So grid size is 13x15. So grid boundaries: Possibly the rule operates on the \"frame\" or something.\n\nLet's analyze E1 carefully.\n\nWe have a grid with 13 rows and 15 columns. The digits present are 0,3. The pattern is like a frame or border shape? It appears in input E1, rows 4,7,10 have pattern \"00033333333300\" (with 3's in columns 3 to 10 maybe) or something similar. Let's check row4: \"00033333333300\" means first three digits are 0, then 9 digits of 3, then two digits 0? Let's count columns: \"000\" (3 zeros) then \"333333333\" (9 digits 3?) then \"00\". Actually count: \"00033333333300\" length equals 3+9+2 = 14? But wait, we need 15 columns. Let's count precisely: \"00033333333300\" count digits:\n   It might be \"000\" = columns 0,1,2, then \"333333333\" = columns 3-11, then \"00\" = columns 12,13. That sums to 3 + 9 + 2 = 14. Wait, let me count: Actually \"00033333333300\" count characters: \"000\" (3) then \"333333333\" (9) then \"00\" (2) gives 3+9+2=14. But our grid should have 15 columns. Let's re-read carefully:\nE1 Input:\nRow0: \"00000000000000\" (15 zeros?) Actually row0 has 15 \"0\"? Let's count: \"00000000000000\" count digits: There are 15 zeros. So grid width is 15 columns.\nRow4: \"00033333333300\" count digits: \"000\" (3) + \"333333333\" (9) + \"00\" (2) equals 14. Wait, 3+9+2 = 14. So maybe row4 actually has 15 digits: Let's count: \"00033333333300\" if I count manually: '0','0','0','3','3','3','3','3','3','3','3','3','3','0','0'? Actually count: I'll recopy: \"00033333333300\". Count: index0:0, index1:0, index2:0, index3:3, index4:3, index5:3, index6:3, index7:3, index8:3, index9:3, index10:3, index11:3, index12:3, index13:0, index14:0. That sums to 15 digits. So yes, it's 15 digits. So each row is 15 columns.\n\nSimilarly, row5: \"00030003000300\": count: 15 digits.\nSo grid is 13 rows x 15 columns.\n\nNow, compare input and output in E1.\n\nInput rows:\nRow0: all zeros.\nRow1: all zeros.\nRow2: all zeros.\nRow3: all zeros.\nRow4: \"00033333333300\"\nRow5: \"00030003000300\"\nRow6: \"00030003000300\"\nRow7: \"00033333333300\"\nRow8: \"00030003000300\"\nRow9: \"00030003000300\"\nRow10:\"00033333333300\"\nRow11:\"00000000000000\"\nRow12:\"00000000000000\"\n\nOutput rows:\nRow0: \"00000000000000\"\nRow1: \"00000000000000\"\nRow2: \"00000000000000\"\nRow3: \"00000000000000\"\nRow4: \"00033333333300\" same as input row4.\nRow5: \"00300030003000\" changed from \"00030003000300\"\nRow6: \"00030003000300\" same as input row6.\nRow7: \"00003333333330\" changed from \"00033333333300\"\nRow8: \"00030003000300\" same as input row8.\nRow9: \"00300030003000\" changed from \"00030003000300\"\nRow10:\"00033333333300\" same as input row10.\nRow11:\"00000000000000\"\nRow12:\"00000000000000\"\n\nSo the transformation only affects certain rows: row5, row7, row9 are changed. Specifically:\nRow4 remains same.\nRow5: input \"00030003000300\" becomes \"00300030003000\". That means that the triple \"300\" has been rotated? Wait, what's the pattern? Let's compare row5 input vs output.\nInput row5: ...: \"00030003000300\". Let's denote segments: It seems the row has structure \"000\" then \"300\" then \"030\" then \"003\" then \"00\"? Let's segment by index:\nIndices: 0-2: \"000\"\nIndices 3-5: \"300\"\nIndices 6-8: \"030\"\nIndices 9-11:\"003\"\nIndices 12-14:\"00\"\nOutput row5: \"00300030003000\"\nSegment: 0-2: \"003\"\n3-5: \"000\"\n6-8: \"300\"\n9-11:\"030\"\n12-14:\"00\"\nSo it looks like a cyclic shift of the 3-digit groups? Specifically, group them as blocks of 3 digits: row5 input blocks: \nBlock1: indices 0-2: \"000\"\nBlock2: indices 3-5: \"300\"\nBlock3: indices 6-8: \"030\"\nBlock4: indices 9-11: \"003\"\nBlock5: indices 12-14: \"00\"? But 15 is not divisible by 3 exactly because 15 mod 3 = 0? Actually, 15 is divisible by 3, so should be 5 blocks exactly if each block is 3 digits. Let's divide row5 input into 5 blocks of 3:\nBlock1: indices 0-2: \"000\"\nBlock2: indices 3-5: \"300\"\nBlock3: indices 6-8: \"030\"\nBlock4: indices 9-11: \"003\"\nBlock5: indices 12-14: \"00\"? Wait, 15/3=5 exactly, so block5 should be 3 digits, not 2. Let's recalc indices: For a 15-digit row, blocks of 3: Block1: indices 0,1,2; Block2: indices 3,4,5; Block3: indices 6,7,8; Block4: indices 9,10,11; Block5: indices 12,13,14.\nNow row5 input: \"00030003000300\". Let's break into 5 groups of 3:\nGroup1: \"000\"\nGroup2: \"300\"\nGroup3: \"030\"\nGroup4: \"003\"\nGroup5: \"00\"? That doesn't work because \"00\" is only 2 digits. Let's count: \"00030003000300\" count: 15 digits should be: \nMaybe I mis-split: Let's count manually: \nCharacters: 0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0.\nWait, that's 14 characters, but we need 15? Let's recount each row carefully. I'll count digits in row5 input: \"00030003000300\". Count by grouping:\n\"000\" (3 digits) then", "prompt_tokens": 1221, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's compare line-by-line:\n\nLine1: \"1111111111111111111111111\" remains same.\nLine2: Input: \"1235532123500002355321235\"\n         Output: \"1235532123553212355321235\" \n         So there's a difference: starting \"1235532123\" then \"50000\" vs \"355321\" maybe swapped? Let's compare carefully:\n\nFor line2: input: 1235532123500002355321235\nOutput: 1235532123553212355321235\n\nPositions: They are of length 25? Let's count. Actually, let me count digits:\nFor line2 input: \"1235532123500002355321235\". Count digits: It has length 25? Possibly 25 digits.\nI need to see pattern. Wait, count: \"1111111111111111111111111\" length 25? Actually count: \"1111111111111111111111111\" is 25 characters? Let's count: \"1111111111111111111111111\" = 25 digits if count: 1's repeated 25 times. Check: \"1235532123500002355321235\" count digits: 1 2 3 5 5 3 2 1 2 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 5 5 3 2 1 2 3 5? That is 25 digits indeed.\nSo grid is 25x25? Actually how many rows? In example 1, line count: There are 28 lines in input and output? Let's count:\nE.g. 1 input: There are 28 lines? Let's count manually: \nI see: \nLine1: 1111111111111111111111111\nLine2: 1254521254521254521254521\nLine3: 1551551551551551551551551\nLine4: 1414141414141414141414141\nLine5: 1551551551551551551551551\nLine6: 1254521254521254521254521\nLine7: 1111111111111111111111111\nLine8: 1254521254521254521254521\nLine9: 1551551551551551551551551\nLine10: 1414141414141414141414141\nLine11: 1551551551551551551551551\nLine12: 1254521254521254521254521\nLine13: 1111111111111111111111111\nLine14: 1254521254521254521254521\nLine15: 1551551551551551551551551\nLine16: 1414141414141414141414141\nLine17: 155155155", "prompt_tokens": 2171, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let me analyze each example.\n\nWe have e.g. 1:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nRow-by-row: \nRow0: \"000000000000000\"\nRow1: \"002570000000000\"\nRow2: \"002870000000000\"\nRow3: \"003330000000000\"\nRow4: \"000000000000000\"\nRow5: \"000000000000000\"\nRow6: \"000000000000000\"\nRow7: \"000000000000000\"\nRow8: \"000000000000000\"\nRow9: \"000000000000000\"\nRow10: \"000000000000000\"\nRow11: \"000000000000000\"\nRow12: \"000000000000000\"\nRow13: \"000000000000000\"\nRow14: \"000000000000000\"\n\nOutput:\nRow0: \"020507000000000\"\nRow1: \"002570000000000\"\nRow2: \"222877777777777\"\nRow3: \"003330000000000\"\nRow4: \"030303000000000\"\nRow5: \"300300300000000\"\nRow6: \"000300030000000\"\nRow7: \"000300003000000\"\nRow8: \"000300000300000\"\nRow9: \"000300000030000\"\nRow10: \"000300000003000\"\nRow11: \"000300000000300\"\nRow12: \"000300000000030\"\nRow13: \"000300000000003\"\nRow14: \"000300000000000\"\n\nObserving pattern: In the input grid, non-zero digits are in rows 1,2,3? Actually examine rows: Row1: digits \"2\", \"5\", \"7\". Row2: \"2\", \"8\", \"7\". Row3: \"3\", \"3\", \"3\". The output grid: row0: \"020507000000000\", row1: \"002570000000000\", row2: \"222877777777777\", row3: \"003330000000000\", etc.\n\nObserving differences: The input row1: \"002570000000000\" becomes output row1: \"002570000000000\" unchanged? Actually check row1: input row1 is \"002570000000000\" exactly equals output row1? Wait, check row1 in output: \"002570000000000\" exactly equals the input row1. But then row0 changed: input row0 \"000000000000000\" becomes row0 output \"020507000000000\"? And row2: input \"002870000000000\" becomes row2 output \"222877777777777\"? And row3: input \"003330000000000\" becomes row3 output \"003330000000000\"? Hmm.\n\nMaybe the transformation involves something like: reading the input grid and then placing numbers in diagonals? Also notice the pattern in rows 4 to 14 of output: They all have \"030303\" pattern? Let's check row4: output \"030303000000000\". Row5: \"300300300000000\". Row6: \"000300030000000\". Row7: \"000300003000000\". Row8: \"000300000300000\". Row9: \"000300000030000\". Row10: \"000300000003000\". Row11: \"000300000000300\". Row12: \"000300000000030\". Row13: \"000300000000003\". Row14: \"000300000000000\".\n\nI see a pattern of \"300\" and \"030\" alternating or a pattern that seems to be reading the original \"3\" digit? Not sure.\n\nI need to re-read the examples with careful observation.\n\nI think the rule might be: The transformation involves drawing outlines or paths. Possibly the rule is: \"Draw a path from a starting point, following the digits as instructions for movement, and fill cells accordingly.\" Let me recall known ARC tasks: There's one called \"spiral\" or \"line drawing\" tasks.\n\nWait, let me try to interpret e.g. 1: The input grid has some non-zero digits in rows 1,2,3. They are: row1: column? Let's locate coordinates: The grid is 16x16? Actually, row indices: 0 to 14. The grid is 15 rows? Wait, the first example: \"000000000000000\" is row0, row1: \"002570000000000\", row2: \"002870000000000\", row3: \"003330000000000\", then rows 4 to 14 are zeros. So there are 15 rows total. And each row has 15 columns? Actually count: \"000000000000000\" has 15 zeros if no spaces. But the provided string \"000000000000000\" is 15 characters? Actually count: There are 15 digits in row0? Let me count: \"000000000000000\" I count maybe 15 digits. But then e.g. 1 output row2 is \"222877777777777\", which is 15 digits as well. So grid size is 15x15. Similarly, e.g. 2: input is 10 rows and 10 columns. e.g. 3: input has 20 rows and 20 columns. So grid sizes vary.\n\nI need to see transformation rule. Look at e.g. 1: The digits in input row1: \"002570000000000\". The nonzero digits are: at col0: 0, col1: 0, col2: 2, col3: 5, col4: 7, then rest are zeros. In output row1, the same string appears unchanged. So row1 seems to be a \"seed\" row, maybe used to generate others.\n\nWhat about row0 in output? It becomes \"020507000000000\". Compare with row1 input. Specifically, row1 input is \"002570000000000\". But row0 output: \"020507000000000\". They share \"2570\" in a cyclic permutation? Let's compare digits: row1 input: \"002570000000000\". If we remove the leading zeros? Or maybe it's like a shift: \"2570\" vs \"20507\"? Wait, \"020507\" vs \"002570\": not exactly.\n\nRow0 output: \"020507\" at beginning, then \"000000000\". Row1 output: \"002570\". They look like a rotation: \"2570\" shifted left one digit becomes \"5702\"? Let's check: \"2570\" rotated left becomes \"5702\", but row0 has \"20507\" which is 5 digits, not 4. Hmm.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Look for contiguous non-zero digits, and then fill the grid along diagonals, etc.\" The appearance of numbers \"300\" in rows 4 to 14: They are a repeated pattern \"300\" and \"030\". Maybe they are drawing a diagonal line from row4 col? Let's check row4: \"030303000000000\". Which columns are nonzero? It has \"03\", \"03\", \"03\" then zeros. So it's like a pattern with period 3. Row5: \"300300300000000\": pattern \"300300300\". Row6: \"000300030000000\": pattern with one zero, then \"30003\"? Wait, let's check row6: \"000300030000000\": It might be \"00\" then \"30003\" then \"00000\". Actually, let me try to align them: The lower rows (row 4 to row 14) are all different. \nRow4: 030303000000000\nRow5: 300300300000000\nRow6: 000300030000000\nRow7: 000300003000000\nRow8: 000300000300000\nRow9: 000300000030000\nRow10: 000300000003000\nRow11: 000300000000300\nRow12: 000300000000030\nRow13: 000300000000003\nRow14: 000300000000000\n\nIt seems like a pattern that is built by taking a \"seed\" string \"300\" and then progressively shifting it to the right. In many ARC tasks, a common pattern is to take a segment from the input and then propagate it diagonally. Perhaps the rule is: \"Take the leftmost non-zero digit in the top row of non-zero digits and then create a diagonal stripe from that starting point to the bottom right, incrementing the digit in each step.\" But the numbers are not sequential. They are \"2\", \"5\", \"7\", \"3\", etc.\n\nWait, let me look at e.g. 1 row2 output: \"222877777777777\". That row has a lot of 2's and 7's. And input row2 was \"002870000000000\". So maybe the rule involves reading the input digits in order and then using them to fill a pattern that radiates outward.\n\nMaybe we should compare e.g. 2 and e.g. 3: They are different in pattern: e.g. 2 input grid: some rows have non-zero digits: row2: \"0003120000", "prompt_tokens": 1081, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Wait, let's compare row by row:\n\nRow1: input \"0000000000000000555555\" output is same. So row1 unchanged.\nRow2: input \"0888888000000000525555\", output \"0222222000000000525555\". So what changed? The left \"08\" became \"02\". The sequence \"888888\" became \"22222\"? But careful: The input row2: \"0888888000000000525555\". It might be segmented as: \"0\", \"8\", \"888888\", \"0\", rest \"0000000000525555\"? But output is \"0\", \"2\", \"22222\" not matching count? Let's check carefully:\n\nWe have input row2: \"0888888000000000525555\". Count digits: length = 20? Let's count: row1 length is 20 digits. Let me count row2: \"0\" (1), \"8\" (2), \"888888\" (8 digits total, so positions 3 to 8), then \"8\" (position9?) Wait I need to recalc: Actually, the string \"0888888000000000525555\" count digits: \"0\" then \"8\", then \"888888\", then \"8\", then \"00000000\", then \"0525555\". Let's count properly: It is provided as a string without spaces. So length is 20 characters? Let's count: For row1, the string \"0000000000000000555555\" count: \"0000000000000000\" is 16 zeros, then \"55555\" is 5 fives? That totals 21? Wait, I should count: \"0000000000000000555555\" length = 20? Let's count manually: \n\"0\" x? Let's count row1: \"0000000000000000555555\". Count: There are 16 zeros? Actually, let me count: There are 16 digits before the first 5 maybe? Actually, I'll count: \"0000000000000000\" is 16 zeros, then \"55555\" is 5 digits, so total 21. But the input grid is given with newlines, so each row might have different lengths. Let's re-read problem statement: They are represented as strings. Possibly they are 20 columns in some examples? But row1: \"0000000000000000555555\" has 20 digits? Let's count: \"0000000000000000\" is 16 digits, then \"55555\" is 5 digits, so total 21. But maybe each row is of length 20? Let me check row2: \"0888888000000000525555\", count digits: \"0\" (1), \"8\" (2), \"888888\" (6 digits? Actually \"888888\" count digits: 6 digits? Actually \"888888\" has 6 digits, but here we see string \"0888888\" maybe? Let's check carefully: \"0888888000000000525555\" appears to have two groups \"08\" then \"8888880\"? Possibly it's \"0888888\" is 7 digits? Let's count manually carefully the digits by grouping:\n\nI will re-read the given examples with spaces inserted after counting maybe the columns. The problem statement says \"e.g. 1 Input:\" then shows multiple rows. They are provided as one string per row. I should count the characters in one row. Let me count row 1: \"0000000000000000555555\". Count digits: I'll count manually:\nRow1: \"0000000000000000555555\"\nI can count: There are 16 zeros? Let's count: \"0000000000000000\" count: 1-16, then \"55555\" count: 5 digits, total 21 digits. But maybe it's 21 columns. Let me check row2: \"0888888000000000525555\". Count digits: The string length: \"0888888\" maybe count: \"0\" (1), \"8\" (2), then \"888888\" (6 digits?) Actually, let's count group by group:\nMaybe I'll count index positions:\nRow2: characters:\nIndex: 1: 0\n2: 8\n3: 8\n4: 8\n5: 8\n6: 8\n7: 8\n8: 8? Wait, the string \"0888888000000000525555\" if I group: It might be \"0\", \"8888888\", \"00000000\", \"0525555\". Because row1 is \"0000000000000000555555\", which is \"0000000000000000\" then \"55555\". So row2 might be \"0\", \"8888888\", \"00000000\", \"0525555\". Let's count: \"8888888\" has 7 digits. So row2 would be: digit1: 0, then 7 digits of 8, then \"00000000\" is 8 zeros, then \"0525555\" is 7 digits. So total 1+7+8+7 = 23 digits. But row1 had 16+5=21 digits. So they are not same. Possibly I misinterpreted. Let's try to count row1 by counting characters:\nRow1: \"0000000000000000555555\"\nMaybe I'll count: There are 16 zeros then 5 fives. But visually, \"0000000000000000\" might be 16 zeros if I count them: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16, then \"55555\". So row1 is 21 digits.\nNow row2: \"0888888000000000525555\". Count zeros: There is a leading \"0\", then \"8888880\" might be 7 digits, then zeros: \"00000000\" might be 8 zeros, then \"525555\" maybe 6 digits? Let's count manually with indices:\nRow2 string: \"0 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 5 5 5 5\" might be 21 digits.\nLet's try grouping by equal lengths: Possibly each row is 21 characters. Let's count row2: \nCharacters: \nIndex: 1: '0'\n2: '8'\n3: '8'\n4: '8'\n5", "prompt_tokens": 1163, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Wait, count: \"000500000000000\" is 16 digits if counting positions: positions: 0,1,2, then 5 at position 3? Let's count: Actually, let me count carefully. \"000500000000000\" length = 16 exactly. It is grid of 16 x 16? Actually, check: There are 16 lines provided. So grid dimensions could be 16 rows x 16 columns?

But then e.g.1 and e.g.3 are 16 x 16 grids, but e.g.2 is 15 x 16 grid. And test input is 16 lines? Let's check test input: There are 15 lines? Let's count test input lines:\nTest Input:\nLine1: \"000500000000000\"\nLine2: \"010500001000000\"\nLine3: \"000503000080007\"\nLine4: \"555500600000000\"\nLine5: \"000000000400620\"\nLine6: \"000000900030000\"\nLine7: \"000108700000030\"\nLine8: \"000070072000000\"\nLine9: \"000004100066000\"\nLine10: \"000000008000000\"\nLine11: \"000000000009000\"\nLine12: \"000000009000000\"\nLine13: \"000000000400020\"\nLine14: \"000100000000000\"\nLine15: \"000090000007000\"\n\nWait, count lines: I count: There are 15 lines, not 16. So grid sizes vary: one example is 16x16, one is 15x16, one is 16x16 again, and test input is 15x16? Let's recount e.g.3 input: It has 16 lines? Let's count: Provided e.g.3 Input:\n\"000500003000000\" (line1)\n\"030500000000003\" (line2)\n\"000506000090009\" (line3)\n\"555500020000004\" (line4)\n\"000000000006000\" (line5)\n\"000004000000400\" (line6)\n\"000000004000901\" (line7)\n\"400002000000004\" (line8)\n\"082000000000000\" (line9)\n\"090000500002000\" (line10)\n\"000004000300009\" (line11)\n\"010000000000000\" (line12)\n\"300010000090000\" (line13)\n\"000000000000000\" (line14)\n\"000003006001008\" (line15)\n\nSo e.g.3 has 15 lines. So we have grids of varying height (and fixed width of 16 columns maybe?) Actually, check width: In e.g.3, line1 \"000500003000000\" is 16 digits? Count: \"0005\" =4, \"000\" =3, \"0000000\" maybe? Let's count exactly: \"000500003000000\" count digits: 0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 = 16 digits. So width is always 16. So grid dimensions: e.g.1: 16 rows x 16 cols, e.g.2: 15 rows x 16 cols, e.g.3: 15 rows x 16 cols, test input: 15 rows x 16. So rule might be specific to the grid layout.\n\nNow what is transformation done? Compare input and output for each example. Look at differences between input and output grids.\n\nLet's denote each grid row as a string of digits, but they represent numbers? They could be numbers with possibly multi-digit numbers? But they are not separated by spaces. They are drawn as contiguous digits. They might represent colored blocks? Possibly each unique number represents a color.\n\nIn ARC tasks, often rule is to remove isolated elements or to remove elements if they are not adjacent to some color, etc. Let's compare differences row by row.\n\nLet's label each grid cell with its digit color. But note: Some cells have numbers like \"06\", \"08\", \"07\", etc. But they are not single digits; they are", "prompt_tokens": 1051, "completion_tokens": 2048}

That isn't consistent.\n\nWait, let's recalc properly: I need to count characters.

Wait, let's count properly: \"56123456123456123456123\" \nLet's count digits:\n- It seems pattern: maybe grid dimensions? Possibly 4 rows and 6 columns? But string length 24 might be a 4x6 grid. But then 4 rows * 6 columns = 24. But then each row is 6 characters. Let's see: if we break first output line \"56123456123456123456123\" into groups of 6: \nGroup1: \"561234\" \nGroup2: \"561234\" \nGroup3: \"561234\" \nGroup4: \"56123\" and leftover? Let's check: 6+6+6 = 18, then remainder is 6, so yes groups: 561234, 561234, 561234, 56123? Wait, 561234 is 6 digits, so 3 groups is 18, then 24 - 18 = 6, so yes. Let's check: \"561234\" then \"561234\" then \"561234\" then \"56123\"? But that would be 6 digits, but \"56123\" is only 5 digits. Let's recalc: 24/6=4, so each row should be 6 characters. So the string should split into 4 groups of 6. Let's try splitting \"56123456123456123456123\" into 6-digit groups: \nTake first 6: \"561234\"\nRemaining: \"56123456123456123\" (18 digits)\nTake next 6: \"561234\"\nRemaining: \"56123456123\" (12 digits)\nTake next 6: \"561234\"\nRemaining: \"56123\" (6 digits)\nTake next 6: \"56123\"? Actually \"56123\" is only 5 digits. Let's check length: 6+6+6+6 = 24. So the string must be 24 digits, but I'm getting 23 digits? Let's re-read the string: \"56123456123456123456123\". Count manually each digit: I'll count groups manually:\nDigit by digit:\n1: 5\n2: 6\n3: 1\n4: 2\n5: 3\n6: 4\n7: 5\n8: 6\n9: 1\n10: 2\n11: 3\n12: 4\n13: 5\n14: 6\n15: 1\n16: 2\n17: 3\n18: 4\n19: 5\n20: 6\n21: 5\n22: 4\n23: 1\n24: 2\n25: 3? That would be 25 digits.\nMaybe I'm miscounting. Let's count properly the string \"56123456123456123456123\". I'll index each character:\nIndex: char\n0: '5'\n1: '6'\n2: '1'\n3: '2'\n4: '3'\n5: '4'\n6: '5'\n7: '6'\n8: '1'\n9: '2'\n10: '3'\n11: '4'\n12: '5'\n13: '6'\n14: '1'\n15: '2'\n16: '3'\n17: '4'\n18: '5'\n19: '6'\n20: '5'\n21: '4'\n22: '1'\n23: '2'\n24: '3'? That seems to be 25 digits if we count index 0 to 24, total 25 digits.\nWait, let me count length by grouping: The string \"56123456123456000456123\" in E.g. 1 Input: It might be 25 characters. Let's count that original string with spaces maybe:\n\"56 1234 561234 56000 456123\". But then \"56000\" is 5 digits, \"456123\" is 6 digits, \"123\" is 3 digits, not likely.\n\nActually, I think the intended grid might be 5 rows x 5 columns = 25 cells. Let's check: The first string \"56123456123456000456123\": count digits =? I'll count carefully with grouping in blocks of 5 maybe.\nMaybe the grid is 5x5. 5x5=25. Let's try splitting \"56123456123456000456123\" into 5-digit groups:\nGroup them: first 5: \"56123\"\nNext 5: \"45612\" (Wait, the next 5 digits after \"56123\" would be \"34561\"? Let's do: \"56123456123456000456123\".\nTake first 5: \"56123\"\nRemaining: \"4561234560000456123\"? That doesn't match.\nMaybe try 5 columns: 25 digits/5=5 rows.\nLet's try splitting \"56123456123456000456123\" into 5 groups of 5 digits each:\nWe need 25 digits. Let's count: \nI will count manually by index:\nCharacters: \nIndex: char\n0: 5\n1: 6\n2: 1\n3: 2\n4: 3  -> group1: \"56123\"\n5: 4\n6: 5\n7: 1\n8: 2\n9: 3  -> group2: \"45123\"? That would be \"45123\". But wait, what's digits 5-9: digit 5: '4', 6: '5', 7: '1', 8: '2', 9: '3'. So group2 =", "prompt_tokens": 1870, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The provided final test input grid is a text block with rows of 0s and some digits.)\n\nWe need to deduce a transformation rule from the provided examples. Possibly the transformation rule is something like: \"Find the outermost layer of a shape, and then output a pattern with numbers, maybe \"8\"s and \"0\"s\" or \"8\" on the border and \"0\" inside?\" Let's analyze the examples.\n\nWe are given three examples. I'll denote the examples with E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3.\n\nLet's inspect E.g. 1:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n```\n0000000000000044400000000\n0000000000003346433000000\n0000000000003246423000000\n0000000000003246423000000\n0000000000003246423000000\n0000044400003246423000000\n0003346433003246423000000\n0003246423003246423000000\n0003246423003246423000000\n0003246423003246423000000\n0003246423003246423000000\n0003246423003246423000000\n0003246423003246423000000\n0003246423003346433000000\n0000246420000044400000000\n0000046400000000000000000\n0000246420000000000000000\n0003246423000000000000000\n0003346433000000000000000\n0000044400000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000000\n```\nE.g. 1 Output:\n```\n8000008\n8800088\n8000008\n```\nObservations: The input is a grid of \"0\" digits with some other digits like 4, 3, 2, etc. The output is a 3x? grid of digits \"8\" and \"0\". The output grid is much smaller than input. It might be deducing \"mirrored\" coordinates? Possibly the transformation is to extract a bounded region, then mirror it horizontally/vertically.\n\nWait, let's re-read the problem statement: \"The examples represent a hidden transformation rule.\" Possibly the rule is: \"Find a specific pattern in the input grid, then produce a new grid that looks like a \"frame\" with 8's on the border and 0's inside.\" But then check E.g. 1 Output: It's a 3x? Actually, output E.g.1: It's 3 lines, each line is digits. They are \"8000008\", \"8800088\", \"8000008\". They are 7-digit long. So it's a 3x7 grid. But then the input grid is 23 rows? Actually, count rows in E.g. 1 input: There are 23 rows (I see 23 lines each of length 24 maybe? Let's count: Actually, the provided E.g.1 input seems to have 23 lines. Wait, count them: There is a line: \"0000000000000044400000000\" (1), then \"0000000000003346433000000\" (2), then \"0000000000003246423000000\" (3), then \"0000000000003246423000000\" (4), then \"0000000000003246423000000\" (5), then \"0000044400003246423000000\" (6), then \"0003346433003246423000000\" (7), then \"0003246423003246423000000\" (8), then \"0003246423003246423000000\" (9), then \"0003246423003246423000000\" (10), then \"0003246423003246423000000\" (11), then \"0003246423003246423000000\" (12), then \"0003246423003246423000000\" (13), then \"0003246423003346433000000\" (14), then \"0000246420000044400000000\" (15), then \"0000046400000000000000000\" (16), then \"0000246420000000000000000\" (17), then \"0003246423000000000000000\" (18), then \"0003346433000000000000000\" (19), then \"0000044400000000000000000\" (20), then \"0000000000000000000000000\" (21), then \"0000000000000000000000000\" (22), then \"0000000000000000000000000\" (23). So input is 23x? columns, each row length seems to be 24 digits. And output is 3x7 grid, which is significantly smaller.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Extract a central rectangle from the input, then mirror it across its center?\" But then E.g. 1 output \"8000008\", \"8800088\", \"8000008\" - This pattern: center row: \"8800088\". Outer rows: \"8000008\". This pattern is like a \"frame\": the corners are 8 and the edges are 8, and the inside is 0. In a 3x7 grid, if we consider index (0,0) top-left is 8, then (0,6)=8, (1,0)=8, (1,6)=8, (2,0)=8, (2,6)=8, and the rest are 0, except the center row is filled with 8 except at the ends? Let's check: top row: \"8 0 0 0 0 0 8\". Middle row: \"8 8 0 0 0 8 8\". Bottom row: \"8 0 0 0 0 0 8\".\nThis is like a frame. But then what does it have to do with the input?\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Find the bounding box of nonzero digits in the input grid, then output a grid that is the shape of that bounding box's border, where border cells are replaced with 8, and internal cells with 0.\" But then check E.g. 1 input: The nonzero digits are \"4\",\"3\",\"2\", etc. I see many digits in the input. Possibly we extract the bounding box that contains all nonzero digits. Let's check:\nIn E.g. 1, the nonzero digits appear in rows: They appear in row 1: \"4440\" at positions maybe columns? Let's see: \"0000000000000044400000000\" row 1: There's \"4440\" at positions 13-16 (0-indexed columns) maybe? Actually, count zeros: \"0000000000000\" then \"4440\" then \"0000000\". So nonzero digits appear in row 1 at columns 12, 13, 14? Let's check carefully: The given string \"0000000000000044400000000\" has length 24. Count zeros: It might be 12 zeros, then \"4440\", then 7 zeros? But \"4440\" is 4 digits, so total length would be 12+4+? doesn't add to 24? Let's count: \"000000000000\" is 12 zeros. Then \"4440\" is 4 digits, so that makes 16, then \"0000000\" is 7 zeros, total 23. But we expect 24. Let me recount: Actually, the string \"0000000000000044400000000\" count characters: I'll count manually: \nCharacters: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23.\nThe string: \"0000000000000044400000000\" if we assume it's 24 characters long, then the zeros at beginning are maybe 12 zeros? Actually, let me count: \"000000000000\" is 12 zeros, then \"4440\" is 4 digits, that makes 16, then \"0000000\" is 7 zeros, total 23. So it might be 23 columns, but then output is 7 columns wide. But output is \"8000008\" which is 7 characters. So maybe input width is 24 columns? Let's count again: \"0000000000000044400000000\" count manually: \nI can count zeros: It might be easier: The output width is 7, so maybe the chosen bounding box has width 7, height 3. That is the output shape. So maybe the rule: \"Find the bounding box of nonzero digits? But then the output grid is 3x7, which is a rectangle with a frame of 8's on the border and zeros inside.\" But then check E.g. 2: \nE.g. 2 Input has many rows, many", "prompt_tokens": 1373, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The problem states that we are provided several pairs of example input grids and their corresponding output grids, representing a hidden transformation rule. Then final test input grid is provided. We need to deduce the rule from the examples and apply to test input grid.\n\nWe have:\n\nExamples:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n\"050\"\n\"555\"\n\"050\"\nThen Output:\n\"001200\"\n\"002100\"\n\"121212\"\n\"212121\"\n\"001200\"\n\"002100\"\n\nE.g. 2:\nInput:\n\"500\"\n\"050\"\n\"005\"\nOutput:\n\"120000\"\n\"210000\"\n\"001200\"\n\"002100\"\n\"000012\"\n\"000021\"\n\nE.g. 3:\nInput:\n\"050\"\n\"055\"\n\"550\"\nOutput:\n\"001200\"\n\"002100\"\n\"001212\"\n\"002121\"\n\"121200\"\n\"212100\"\n\nTest Input:\n\"000\"\n\"050\"\n\"555\"\n\nWe need to decode transformation rule from these examples. Let's denote grid as an array of digits. The grids are small. Possibly transformation rule is replication and transformation of digits. Let's analyze examples.\n\nWe have sample input and output grids. The provided outputs are 6 lines for input 3 lines? But examples: E.g. 1 input has 3 lines, output has 6 lines. E.g. 2 input has 3 lines, output has 6 lines. E.g. 3 input has 3 lines, output has 6 lines. So transformation: input grid 3 rows becomes output grid 6 rows. And number of columns? E.g. 1 input columns: 3, output columns: 6 digits per row. E.g. 2 input: columns: 3, output: 6 digits. E.g. 3 input: columns: 3, output: 6 digits.\n\nSo transformation maps a grid of size 3x? Possibly the output grid is 2 times rows and 2 times columns? But check: E.g. 1: input: 3 rows x 3 columns, output: 6 rows x 6 columns = exactly 2x scaling in both dimensions. E.g. 2: input 3x3, output 6x6. E.g.3: input 3x3, output 6x6. So pattern: Output grid is 2 times each dimension of input.\n\nWhat is transformation rule? Possibly each cell in input is replaced with a 2x2 block in the output, but with some transformation.\n\nLet's check E.g. 1 input: \nRow1: \"050\"\nRow2: \"555\"\nRow3: \"050\"\nOutput: six rows of 6 digits.\nWe need to see how each input cell transforms into a 2x2 block in the output. Let's denote coordinates input as (r, c) with r=0,1,2 and c=0,1,2. And output grid coordinates (R, C) with R=0...5, C=0...5. I suspect each input cell gives a 2x2 block in a pattern determined by the input digit, but maybe with rotation or reflection? Let's try to deduce mapping from input cell (0,0) with digit '0' to output block positions? The output's top-left 2x2 block must come from input cell (0,0)? Let\u2019s check E.g. 1: first row of output: \"001200\". But wait, \"001200\" is 6 digits. The top-left 2x2 block in the output: positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) should correspond to input (0,0) digit. But what is input (0,0)? It's '0'. But then we see \"00\" in row0 columns 0-1, and row1 columns 0-1 are \"01\"? Let me re-read output for E.g. 1:\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nLine1: 001200\nLine2: 002100\nLine3: 121212\nLine4: 212121\nLine5: 001200\nLine6: 002100\n\nWait, I'm trying to segment them into 2x2 blocks. But careful: The output grid is 6x6. If transformation is doubling both dimensions, then each input cell should correspond to a 2x2 block in the output grid. But 6x6 can be partitioned into 9 blocks of 2x2? But 9 blocks of 2x2 would only cover 18x18? Actually, 6x6 grid divided into blocks of 2x2 gives 3 blocks horizontally and 3 blocks vertically. So each 2x2 block corresponds to one input cell? But then total output cells count would be 3*3*4 = 36, but our output grid is 36 cells, so that fits.\n\nWait, 3 input rows and 3 input columns, each mapping to a 2x2 block gives 9 blocks, each 4 cells, total 36 cells. But the output grid is 6x6 = 36 cells. So partition the output grid into 9 blocks of size 2x2. How are they arranged? They are arranged in a 3x3 grid of blocks, but each block is 2x2. However, note: 6 is not equal to 3*2 because 3*2 = 6. So yes, it works.\n\nNow, let's denote block indices: block (i, j) corresponds to input cell (i, j). And each block is a 2x2 subgrid in the output with top-left corner at (2*i, 2*j). Let's denote that.\n\nNow let's analyze E.g. 1. Input grid:\nRow0: col0=0, col1=5, col2=0.\nRow1: col0=5, col1=5, col2=5.\nRow2: col0=0, col1=5, col2=0.\nOutput grid partitioned into blocks:\nBlock (0,0) covers output rows 0-1, columns 0-1.\nBlock (0,1) covers output rows 0-1, columns 2-3.\nBlock (0,2) covers output rows 0-1, columns 4-5.\nBlock (1,0) covers output rows 2-3, columns 0-1.\nBlock (1,1) covers output rows 2-3, columns 2-3.\nBlock (1,2) covers output rows 2-3, columns 4-5.\nBlock (2,0) covers output rows 4-5, columns 0-1.\nBlock (2,1) covers output rows 4-5, columns 2-3.\nBlock (2,2) covers output rows 4-5, columns 4-5.\n\nNow let's fill in numbers from E.g. 1 Output:\nRow0: \"001200\" means:\nBlock (0,0): (0,0) -> '0', (0,1) -> '0'\nBlock (0,1): (0,2) -> '1', (0,3) -> '2'\nBlock (0,2): (0,4) -> '0', (0,5) -> '0'\nRow1: \"002100\" means:\nBlock (0,0): (1,0) -> '0', (1,1) -> '2'\nBlock (0,1): (1,2) -> '1', (1,3) -> '0'\nBlock (0,2): (1,4) -> '0', (1,5) -> '0'\nRow2: \"121212\" means:\nBlock (1,0): (2,0) -> '1', (2,1) -> '2'\nBlock (1,1): (2,2) -> '1', (2,3) -> '2'\nBlock (1,2): (2,4) -> '1', (2,5) -> '2'\nRow3: \"212121\" means:\nBlock (1,0): (3,0) -> '2', (3,1) -> '1'\nBlock (1,1): (3,2) -> '2', (3,3) -> '1'\nBlock (1,2): (3,4) -> '2', (3,5) -> '1'\nRow4: \"001200\" means:\nBlock (2,0): (4,0) -> '0', (4,1) -> '0'\nBlock (2,1): (4,2) -> '1', (4,3) -> '2'\nBlock (2,2): (4,4) -> '0', (4,5) -> '0'\nRow5: \"002100\" means:\nBlock (2,0): (5,0) -> '0', (5,1) -> '2'\nBlock (2,1): (5,2) -> '1', (5,3) -> '0'\nBlock (2,2): (5,4) -> '0', (5,5) -> '0'\n\nSo now, let's try to deduce mapping from input digit to 2x2 block in each case. Let's denote input grid cell value and then corresponding block from output.\n\nFor each block (i, j) corresponding to input digit d.

The problem statement: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\"\n\nWe are provided with three examples. Let's call them E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, and then the test input.\n\nWe need to analyze and determine transformation rule. Let's read examples carefully.\n\nI have multiple grids. The examples are given as lines of numbers representing grids. It's not entirely clear what the grid dimensions are. Let me re-read the examples:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n```\n444444444444444\n442222222244444\n442222222244444\n442222222244444\n442222111114444\n442222111114444\n442222111114444\n444444111114444\n444444111114444\n433334444444444\n433334444444444\n444444444444444\n444444444444444\n444444444444444\n```\nE.g. 1 Output:\n```\n33331222\n33331222\n11111222\n11111222\n11111222\n22222222\n```\nObservations: The input grid is 15 rows (I see 15 lines). The output grid is 6 rows x 8 columns. So transformation reduces grid size from 15x? to 6x8. But what's pattern? It appears that the output grid is a \"core\" extracted region from the input grid. Let's check positions.\n\nIt might be a \"cropping\" of the region that is \"non-rectangular\" border. But which region? Let's check coordinates. The input grid is 15 rows by 16 columns? Let's count columns: \"444444444444444\" has 15 digits? Actually \"444444444444444\" count digits: Let's count manually:\n\"444444444444444\". I'll count: digits: 1:4,2:4,3:4,4:4,5:4,6:4,7:4,8:4,9:4,10:4,11:4,12:4,13:4,14:4,15:4. So it's 15 columns. Actually wait: \"444444444444444\" has 15 characters? Let's count: Actually \"444444444444444\" count carefully: that's \"14 fours\"? Let's simulate: \"444444444444444\" might be 15 digits? Let's count manually: \nIndex: \n0: 4, 1:4, 2:4, 3:4, 4:4, 5:4, 6:4, 7:4, 8:4, 9:4, 10:4, 11:4, 12:4, 13:4, 14:4. So length=15. But then the output \"33331222\" has 8 digits. So columns from 15 to 8? But then rows? The input has 15 rows, and the output has 6 rows. So maybe we are extracting a subgrid? Let's check: E.g. 1 output first row \"33331222\". Where might these digits come from in the input? Possibly, the rule is to take a central region or something like that.\n\nLet's check pattern: The input's first row is \"444444444444444\". The output's first row is \"33331222\". It might be that we are \"rotating\" the grid? Not sure.\n\nMaybe the transformation is \"extract the inner square\" from the input grid by removing border rows and columns? Let's check: If we remove the outer border of rows and columns, what subgrid do we get? For a 15-digit grid, removing outer border would leave 13-digit rows? Not 8 columns. Alternatively, maybe the output is a \"pattern\" that is formed by reading a path on the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves \"folding\" the grid along a diagonal. Another possibility: maybe the transformation is \"counting the number of contiguous regions of a certain digit\" or \"summing along diagonals\". Let me check differences: In E.g. 1, the output digits: \"33331222\". In the input, digits 4 appear in many places. The output digits are 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2. It might be that the rule transforms 4 to 3, 2 to 2, and 1 to something? But then second row \"33331222\" is same as first row output. Third row \"11111222\" is different. There is a pattern: first four digits become 3's in rows 1 and 2, then a 1 in the center, then three 2's? Actually \"11111222\" is 6 digits? Let's recount: \"11111222\" is 8 digits? Actually count: \"11111222\": digits: 1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2 (that's 8 digits) The first row: \"33331222\": digits: 3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2. The second row same, the third row \"11111222\" (8 digits), then next three rows are \"11111222\"? Wait, check: Actually E.g. 1 Output has 6 rows: row1: \"33331222\", row2: \"33331222\", row3: \"11111222\", row4: \"11111222\", row5: \"11111222\", row6: \"22222222\". So pattern: top two rows are one pattern, then three rows are another pattern, then bottom row is all 2's. They correspond to some segmentation of the input grid.\n\nMaybe the transformation is \"extract a block from the input grid\" where the rows correspond to some indices of the input grid. Let's try to map indices: The input grid is 15 rows by 15 columns? Wait recalc: Actually the first input line \"444444444444444\" if I count: \"444444444444444\" has 15 characters? But then 15 rows means it's 15x15? But output is 6x8, so not simply a crop. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is \"find the bounding box of a certain pattern\" and then \"shift\" digits inside that bounding box.\n\nI need to look at differences between the input and output grids. Possibly the rule is \"mirror the input along a diagonal\" but then \"compress\" it. Wait, maybe the transformation is to \"extract a submatrix\" corresponding to the region that has changed from one digit to another. Let's check the input: There are three distinct digits: 4, 2, 1. In the output, we see digits: 3, 1, 2. It appears that the output digits are 3, 1, 2 which are not present in the input. So transformation might be \"calculate the difference\" between the two most frequent digits in the input. For E.g.1: In the input, digits 4,2,1 appear. The output digits are 3,1,2. That could be like: 4 becomes 3, 2 stays 2, 1 stays 1. But then why is there a 3? Possibly the rule is \"subtract 1 from the top digit\"? But then 4 becomes 3. But then 2 becomes something? Let's check E.g.2: In E.g.2 input, digits are 8,2,8,5 maybe? Actually E.g.2 input: rows: \"888882222222228\", \"888882222222228\", etc. In output E.g.2, digits are 5, 5, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3,2,2. The transformation: 8 becomes 5? But then 2 remains 2? But then we see a 3 appears in output. In particular, row1 output: \"553333222\". So possibly 8 becomes 5? And 2 becomes 2? But then what about the 3? Possibly 5+? Wait, let's check: In E.g.2, input digits: 8 and 2 and maybe 5? Let's check: In E.g.2, the input lines: first line \"888882222222228\": digits: there are 8's and 2's. Then later lines: \"883332222222228\" then \"883333338888888\", etc. So the digits that appear are 8, 2, and 5 occurs somewhere maybe? Actually, the last lines: \"888888888855888\" and \"888888888855888\". So there is digit 5. And the output: \"553333222\". So what transformation? Possibly it takes the \"center\" of the input grid and then \"reduces\" the size by \"summing\" along diagonals or \"averaging\" counts of digits? Alternatively, maybe it's \"compress\" along rows and columns and then \"shift\" digits.\n\nI need to consider that ARC tasks often involve pattern detection. Could be \"rotate and crop\" maybe.\n\nLet's look at dimensions: E.g.1: Input is 15 rows, output 6 rows. E.g.2: Input is 20 rows? Actually check: E.g.2 input has 20 rows?

They are 14 rows by 20 columns for E.g.1. Let's check the changes. The input and output share some rows exactly. Which rows changed?\n\nRow0: Input: \"0000000000000000000\" Output: \"0000000000000000000\" unchanged.\nRow1: same.\nRow2: same.\nRow3: Input: \"0001000000000000100\", Output: \"0000000000000000000\". So row3 is blanked.\nRow4: Input: \"0001100001100001100\" vs Output: \"0000100001100001000\". So row4 changed: the first two digits \"00\" remain? Let's compare carefully:\nInput row4: \"0001100001100001100\"\nOutput row4: \"0000100001100001000\"\nSo difference: maybe the pattern \"11\" replaced with \"01\"? Let's compare digits: index0: '0' same, index1: '0' same, index2: '0' same, index3: '1' vs '0'? Actually, see: \nIndices:\n0:0 vs0\n1:0 vs0\n2:0 vs0\n3:1 vs0 => changed from 1 to 0.\nThen index4: '1' vs '1'? Actually, row4: \"0001100001100001100\"\nLet's index digits: positions: \n0:0\n1:0\n2:0\n3:1\n4:1\n5:0\n6:0\n7:0\n8:0\n9:1\n10:1\n11:0\n12:0\n13:0\n14:0\n15:1\n16:1\n17:0\n18:0\nSo output row4: \"0000100001100001000\": Let's index:\n0:0\n1:0\n2:0\n3:0\n4:1\n5:0\n6:0\n7:0\n8:0\n9:1\n10:1\n11:0\n12:0\n13:0\n14:0\n15:1\n16:0\n17:0\n18:0? Wait count digits: Actually, check string: It should be 20 digits each row. Let's re-check row lengths: The examples show rows of length 20. Let's re-read row 4 input: \"0001100001100001100\" (20 digits) and row4 output \"0000100001100001000\" (also 20 digits). Let's index them carefully:\nFor row4 input: indices:\n0:0\n1:0\n2:0\n3:1\n4:1\n5:0\n6:0\n7:0\n8:0\n9:1\n10:1\n11:0\n12:0\n13:0\n14:0\n15:1\n16:1\n17:0\n18:0\n19: ? Actually it's 19 digits? Let's count: \"0001100001100001100\" count: 0-2: \"000\" (3 digits), then \"110\" (3 digits -> total 6), then \"000\" (3 digits -> 9), then \"110\" (3 digits -> 12), then \"000\" (3 digits -> 15), then \"1100\" (4 digits -> 19). So actually row4 input string is 19 digits, but expected grid is 20 columns? Let's re-read the provided examples: They are given as lines. It's possible some rows have spaces sometimes. Let's count each row in E.g.1: \nRow0: \"0000000000000000000\" -> 20 digits (0 to 19).\nRow1: same.\nRow2: \"0020000200002000020\" -> 20 digits.\nRow3: \"0001000000000000100\" -> count: \"000100\" (6 digits) then \"0000000\" (7 digits) then \"00100\" (5 digits) total 6+7+5 = 18, not 20. Let's re-read row3: Actually it's \"0001000000000000100\". Count properly: \"000100\" (6), \"0000000\" (7) = 13, then \"00100\" (5) = 18 digits, oh wait I'm off by 2 digits. Let's try to count manually: \nRow3: \"0001000000000000100\"\nCount: 0 1 2 3 4 5: \"000100\" (6 digits), then next 7 digits \"0000000\" makes 13, then \"00100\" makes 18 digits. But expected 20 digits. Possibly some rows have 18 digits? But then row2 has 20 digits. Let's check row2: \"0020000200002000020\" count: \"002\" (3) then \"000\" (3) then \"020\" (3) then \"000\" (3) then \"200\" (3) then \"0020\" (4) equals 20? I'm confused. \nLet's re-read the problem statement: \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then lines. They are in quotes. Maybe each grid is rectangular? They might be not all 20 columns. Possibly the examples are not all same dimensions. But let's re-read E.g.1: There are 13 rows in input, 13 rows in output. They might have different dimensions per row? Possibly the digits are considered as a grid with varying row lengths? But the ARC tasks usually have rectangular grids. Let me try to count each row's length in E.g.1:\n\nRow0: \"0000000000000000000\" -> length = 20.\nRow1: \"0000000000000000000\" -> length = 20.\nRow2: \"0020000200002000020\" -> length = 20.\nRow3: \"0001000000000000100\" -> length? Let's count char by char: \n'0'(1), '0'(2), '0'(3), '1'(4), '0'(5), '0'(6), '0'(7), '0'(8), '0'(9), '0'(10), '0'(11), '0'(12), '0'(13), '0'(14), '1'(15), '0'(16), '0'(17), '0'(18), '0'(19)? Actually, I count: \"0001000000000000100\" -> group them: \"000100\" (6), \"0000000\" (7) equals 13, then \"00100\" (5) equals 18. That yields 18, not 20.\nRow4: \"0001100001100001100\" -> count: \"000110\" (6), \"000110\" (6) equals 12, \"000110\" (6) equals 18. So row4 is 18 digits.\nRow5: \"0000000000100000000\" -> count: \"0000000000\" (10), \"1000000000\" (10) equals 20, so row5 is 20 digits.\nRow6: \"0000000000000000000\" -> 20 digits.\nRow7: \"0020000200002000020\" -> 20 digits.\nRow8: \"0000000001100000000\" -> count: \"0000000001\" (10) then \"1000000000\" (10) equals 20? Wait, \"0000000001100000000\" count: \"0000000001\" (10), then \"1000000000\" (10) equals 20.\nRow9: \"", "prompt_tokens": 1097, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We need to deduce a rule. The provided examples (E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3) contain input and output grids with transformation rule hidden. Must analyze pattern. Let's represent each grid as a list of strings? We are given multiple examples. It appears the grids are 10x20? Wait check first example: It lists lines. They are 20 lines but each line is 20 digits? Actually, count columns? Let's re-check E.g. 1: \"05000000000000000000\" That is 20 digits (1st example, first line has 20 digits, second line etc). Wait, count digits \"05000000000000000000\": count digits: \"05\" then \"0000000000000000000\" equals 2+18 = 20. So grid is 20 rows, 20 columns? But then E.g. 2: \"00000000000000050\" is 20 digits? Actually, count: \"00000000000000050\": that's 17 zeros then \"50\"? Let's count: \"00000000000000000\" is 17 zeros, then \"50\" equals 2 digits, total 19. Wait, let's re-read the examples carefully.\n\nThe problem statement says: \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then list many lines. Let's count the digits in one line from E.g. 1 input: \"05000000000000000000\" has length 20? Let's count: \"05\" is 2 digits, then \"0000000000000000000\" is 18 zeros, so total 20 digits. But then second line: \"00000000000000000000\": that's 20 zeros? Actually, it's \"00000000000000000000\" which is 20 digits. Third line: \"00505000000050000005\": count digits: \"00\" + \"5050\" + \"000000\" + \"500000\" + \"05\"? Let's count carefully: \"00505000000050000005\" is 20 digits? Actually, let me count: \"00\" (2) + \"5050\" (4) = 6, plus \"000000\" (6) = 12, plus \"500000\" (6) = 18, plus \"05\" (2) = 20, yes.\n\nSo E.g. 1 grid is 20 rows x 20 columns.\nE.g. 2 grid: The provided lines: \"00000000000000050\" is 17 digits? Let's check: \"00000000000000050\" count: maybe it's 20 digits as well. Let's count: Actually, \"00000000000000050\" if we count manually: count zeros: There are 14 zeros? Let's count: \"00000000000000050\" -> I see: \"00000000000000000\" is 17 zeros then \"50\"? Actually, no, let me count digit by digit: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0\"? That would be 19 digits. Wait, let's count exactly: The first example lines all have 20 digits? Let's re-read the problem statement text: \"provided input/output examples\" and then \"E.g. 1 Input:\" is given as block of text with each line. The grid lines in E.g. 1: \"05000000000000000000\" -> length? Count: there are 20 characters. \"00000000000000000000\" -> 20 characters. \"00505000000050000005\" -> 20 characters. \"00050000000000000500\" -> 20 characters. \"00000000000000050000\" -> 20 characters. \"00000000000000000000\" -> 20 characters. \"00000008880000505000\" -> 20 digits. \"00000008880000000500\" -> 20 digits. \"00000008880000000000\" -> 20 digits. \"00000000000505000005\" -> 20 digits. \"50000000000000000000\" -> 20 digits. \"00000000500000000000\" -> 20 digits. \"00000000000000000000\" -> 20 digits. \"00000000000000050000\" -> 20 digits. \"00050005000050000000\" -> 20 digits. \"50000000000050500000\" -> 20 digits. \"00000000000000000000\" -> 20 digits. \"00000000000000000000\" -> 20 digits. \"00050000000000000000\" -> 20 digits. \"00000000000000000000\" -> 20 digits.\nSo E.g. 1 is 20 rows x 20 columns.\n\nNow E.g. 2 input: \"00000000000000050\" - maybe it's also 20 columns? Let's count: \"00000000000000050\" count manually: I'll count characters: There are maybe 17 zeros then \"50\"? Actually, count: It might be 18? Let's count digits: The string \"00000000000000050\" if we assume it's same width as E.g. 1, then it's 20 digits, but the provided string length seems shorter than 20 if we count: \"00000000000000050\" -> the number of zeros: There are 14 zeros? Let me count: I'll count grouping: \"000000000000000\" that's 15 zeros? Actually, let's count: I'll count positions: \n- characters: \n1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:0,17:0, then 18:5, 19:0. That gives 19 digits. But maybe the grid is different dimension for each example? \nWait, let me re-read the provided examples carefully. They are presented as blocks with each line's text. Possibly the grids are not rectangular? But usually ARC tasks are rectangular. Let's check E.g. 3 input: The first line \"0050000000000000500\" count: 20 digits? \"0050000000000000500\" length 20? Count: \"00\" then \"5000\" then \"000000\" then \"00500\"? Wait, let's count: Actually \"0050000000000000500\" count: \"00\" (2) + \"5000\" (4) =6, then \"000000\" (6)=12, then \"00500\" (5)=17, then maybe there's one extra? Actually, let's count exactly: \"0050000000000000500\"\nIndices: 0: '0'\n1: '0'\n2: '5'\n3: '0'\n4: '0'\n5: '0'\n6: '0'\n7: '0'\n8: '0'\n9: '0'\n10: '0'\n11: '0'\n12: '0'\n13: '0'\n14: '0'\n15: '0'\n16: '5'\n17: '0'\n18: '0'\n19: '0'? That yields 20 characters if index 19 is '0'? Wait, let's check: \"0050000000000000500\" visually: perhaps it's 19 digits? \nI need to count manually: \"0050000000000000500\" \nGroup digits: \"00\" =2, \"5000\" =4, so total 6, then \"000000\" =6, total 12, then \"00500\" =5, total 17, then what remains? There might be an extra \"00\" at the end? I see the string \"0050000000000000500\" ends with \"500\". Actually, let me re-read the E.g. 3 input lines exactly as provided:\n\nE.g. 3 Input:\n0050000000000000500\n0000000005000000000\n0000500000050000050\n0005000000000050000\n0505000500000000000\n0000000000000000500\n0000005008880000000\n0000050008885000000\n0000000008880050000\n0000000000005000005\n0000000000500500500\n0000000000000000505\n0000000000000000050\n0505000000000005000\n0000000000000000000\n0005005000050000000\n\nCount number of lines in E.g. 3 input: There are 16 lines.

They are similar with two positions with non-zero digits: \"2\" in input grid in E.g. 1: There are two occurrences: one at row 4, col? Let's check:\nRow 4: \"0002000000000\" so digit \"2\" is at column 4? Actually it's \"0002000000000\": positions: index starting from 1, then \"0002000000000\", so the first three digits are 0 then 2 at position 4? Wait re-read: \"0002000000000\" if I count: positions: 1:0, 2:0, 3:0, 4:2, then 5:0, etc. However, in output, row 1: \"0002000020000\", which has two \"2\" segments: \"000200\" then \"002000\". So maybe the transformation rule is to mirror or duplicate the pattern of \"2\" in some symmetrical manner.\n\nLet's compare coordinates of \"2\" in input and output for E.g. 1:\n\nCoordinates for E.g. 1 Input:\n- There is a \"2\" at row 4, column 4? Actually let's check carefully:\nRow 4: \"0002000000000\". So number of characters: it's 13 digits. The substring \"200\" appears at columns 3-5 maybe? Actually \"0002000000000\" if we index from 0, then index positions: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:2,4:0,5:0,... Actually wait: \"0002000000000\" if I count digits: \nDigit positions: 0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:2, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:0, 8:0, 9:0, 10:0, 11:0, 12:0.\nSo the \"2\" is at index 3 (if 0-indexed) or column 4 if 1-indexed.\n\n- And row 10: \"0000000020000\". So in row 10, at index? Let's check row 10: \"0000000020000\"\nCounting: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:2,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0.\nSo the \"2\" is at index 7.\n\nSo input has 2 \"2\" digits, at row 4, col 4 and row 10, col 8 (if using 1-indexed, row4 col4 and row10 col8, but careful: row 10, col? Actually row 10: the \"2\" is at index 7 if 0-indexed, so that's column 8 if 1-indexed).\n\nNow check output for E.g. 1:\nRow 1: \"0002000020000\". That has two \"2\" digits. Where are they? \"0002000020000\": if split: \"000200\" then \"002000\". Let's check indexes: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:2,4:0,5:0, then 6:0,7:0,8:2,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0.\nSo the \"2\" appear at columns 4 and 9. \nRow 2 and row 3 are the same.\nRow 4: \"2222222222222\" - all 2's.\nRow 5 to row 9: \"0002111120000\": they have pattern: first three zeros, then \"21111\" then \"12000\". Actually let's check row 5: \"0002111120000\". Count: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:2,4:1,5:1,6:1,7:1,8:1,9:1? Let's re-read: \"0002111120000\". Actually, count digits: \"0002111120000\" is 13 digits. Let's index: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:2,4:1,5:1,6:1,7:1,8:1,9:1? Wait, let me count properly. I'll count manually: \"0002111120000\" => group digits: \"000\" then \"21111\" then \"20000\"? Actually, let me re-read output row 5 exactly: \"0002111120000\". I need to check carefully: There's a pattern of \"211112\" maybe?\nMaybe better: It says \"0002111120000\". Count length: 13 digits. Let me index:\nIndex: 0:0,1:0,2:0, then digits 3:2, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:1, 8:1, 9:2, 10:0, 11:0, 12:0.\nSo pattern: [0,0,0,2,1,1,1,1,1,2,0,0,0]. So two \"2\"s in that row as well, one at col4 and one at col10. \nRow 10: \"2222222222222\": all 2's.\nRow 11,12,13: \"0002000020000\": which is same as row 1.\n\nSo what transformation rule might be? Observing E.g. 1:\nInput grid has two non-zero \"2\" digits: one at (4,4) and one at (10,8) (if 1-indexed). In output, we see a pattern that fills a rectangle with 2's from row 4 to row 10? Let's check: rows 4, 10 are all 2's. And rows 1,2,3 and 11,12,13 have pattern \"0002000020000\". That pattern has \"2\" at positions 4 and 9.\nThe middle rows (5 to 9) have pattern \"0002111120000\", which has \"2\" at positions 4", "prompt_tokens": 797, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Provided examples input and outputs. The examples are given. The examples are pairs of input grid and output grid transformation rules. The problem asks: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\"\n\nWe are given four examples. They are provided as grids (lines). The grid lines in E.g. 1 Input have up to 3-digit numbers? Wait, let's re-read: The examples:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n110\n110\n888\n888\n011\n011\n880\n111\n880\n880\n111\n111\n111\n888\n888\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n220\n220\n888\n888\n011\n011\n220\n111\n880\n880\n222\n222\n222\n888\n888\n\nObserving pattern: In Example 1, the input and output grids are same, but some rows are transformed. Let's analyze them row by row:\n\nE.g. 1 Input rows:\nRow1: \"110\"\nRow2: \"110\"\nRow3: \"888\"\nRow4: \"888\"\nRow5: \"011\"\nRow6: \"011\"\nRow7: \"880\"\nRow8: \"111\"\nRow9: \"880\"\nRow10:\"880\"\nRow11:\"111\"\nRow12:\"111\"\nRow13:\"111\"\nRow14:\"888\"\nRow15:\"888\"\n\nE.g. 1 Output rows:\nRow1: \"220\"\nRow2: \"220\"\nRow3: \"888\"\nRow4: \"888\"\nRow5: \"011\"\nRow6: \"011\"\nRow7: \"220\"\nRow8: \"111\"\nRow9: \"880\"\nRow10:\"880\"\nRow11:\"222\"\nRow12:\"222\"\nRow13:\"222\"\nRow14:\"888\"\nRow15:\"888\"\n\nSo what changed? Compare row1: \"110\" -> becomes \"220\". Row7: \"880\" becomes \"220\", row11: \"111\" becomes \"222\", row12 \"111\" becomes \"222\", row13 \"111\" becomes \"222\"? Wait, check: Actually row8: \"111\" remains \"111\", row11: \"111\" becomes \"222\", row12: \"111\" becomes \"222\", row13: \"111\" becomes \"222\". There's some pattern. Let's see the digits. Digit '1' and '0' become '2' and '0'? But then row3 \"888\" remains \"888\". Row5 \"011\" remains \"011\", row6 \"011\" remains \"011\", row9 \"880\" remains \"880\", row10 \"880\" remains \"880\", row14 \"888\" remains \"888\", row15 \"888\" remains \"888\". So transformation seems to occur on rows that are not all identical? Let's check: Row1 \"110\": changed to \"220\". Row7 \"880\": changed to \"220\". Row11 \"111\": changed to \"222\". But row8 \"111\" remains \"111\". Also row? Let's check differences digit by digit.\n\nMaybe rule: in some rows, it seems that the first digit is increased by 1 if it is \"0\" or maybe if pattern is \"1\" becomes \"2\" and \"8\" becomes \"2\"? Let's compare digits: Row1: \"110\" -> \"220\". Which digits changed? first digit: 1 changed to 2, second digit: 1 unchanged? third digit: 0 unchanged? Row7: \"880\" -> \"220\": first digit: 8 changed to 2, second digit: 8 unchanged? third digit: 0 unchanged? Row11: \"111\" -> \"222\": all digits: 1->2? row12: \"111\" -> \"222\": all digits: 1->2. row13: \"111\" -> \"222\": all digits: 1->2. But row8: \"111\" remains \"111\". So rule is not global apply on all rows.\n\nMaybe rule is: if a row is composed entirely of 1's then sometimes it becomes 222? But row8, which is all 1's, did not become 222. So maybe rule is: \"if the row has a mix of 1 and 0 or 1 and 8, then add 1 to the 1's\"? But then row1: \"110\": has two 1's and one 0 becomes \"220\": the 1's become 2's. Row7: \"880\": has one 8 in front becomes 2, then the rest remain same. Row11: \"111\" become \"222\". But row8 \"111\" remains \"111\". So why did row8 not change? There might be a pattern regarding columns maybe.\n\nMaybe rule is related to connected components? Possibly rule: \"For each connected group of digits that are not 8, add 1 to them\" or something? But row1 \"110\": it is a block of two 1's, so they become 2's. Row7 \"880\": the '8' might be the background? Let's examine the examples further.\n\nLet's look at E.g. 2 Input and Output:\nE.g. 2 Input:\nRow1: \"08880\"\nRow2: \"08880\"\nRow3: \"11100\"\nRow4: \"08880\"\nRow5: \"08880\"\nRow6: \"11111\"\nRow7: \"08888\"\nRow8: \"08888\"\nRow9: \"11110\"\nRow10:\"11110\"\nRow11:\"08880\"\nRow12:\"01111\"\nRow13:\"01111\"\nRow14:\"88800\"\nRow15:\"00011\"\nRow16:\"88800\"\nRow17:\"88800\"\nRow18:\"00110\"\nRow19:\"00110\"\n\nE.g. 2 Output:\nRow1: \"02220\" (changed from \"08880\")\nRow2: \"02220\"\nRow3: \"11100\" (unchanged)\nRow4: \"08880\" (unchanged)\nRow5: \"08880\"\nRow6: \"22222\" (changed from \"11111\")\nRow7: \"08888\"\nRow8: \"08888\"\nRow9: \"11110\"\nRow10:\"11110\"\nRow11:\"02220\" (changed from \"08880\")\nRow12:\"01111\"\nRow13:\"01111\"\nRow14:\"88800\"\nRow15:\"00022\" (changed from \"00011\" -> last digit changed from 1 to 2)\nRow16:\"88800\"\nRow17:\"88800\"\nRow18:\"00110\"\nRow19:\"00110\"\n\nObserving differences: Row1: \"08880\" becomes \"02220\": Only the first two digits changed from 0,8 to 0,2? Actually check: \"08880\" vs \"02220\": digit by digit: position1: 0 remains 0, position2: 8 becomes 2, position3: 8 becomes 2, position4: 8 becomes 2? Wait, let's check: \"08880\" digits: 0,8,8,8,0. \"02220\": 0,2,2,2,0.\nRow6: \"11111\" becomes \"22222\": all digits become 2.\nRow11: \"08880\" becomes \"02220\": same transformation as row1.\nRow15: \"00011\" becomes \"00022\": last two digits: 1 becomes 2, others remain same.\nSo what pattern? It seems that sometimes the digit '1' becomes '2', and sometimes '8' becomes '2' as well.\n\nLet's check E.g. 3:\n\nE.g. 3 Input:\nRow1: \"1110\" becomes \"2220\" in output.\nRow2: \"1110\" -> \"2220\"\nRow3: \"8888\" -> \"8888\" (unchanged)\nRow4: \"0011\" -> \"0011\" (unchanged)\nRow5: \"0011\" -> \"0011\"\nRow6: \"8888\" -> \"2222\" in output? Check: Actually row6 input \"8888\", output: \"2222\"? Let's check provided: E.g. 3 Output:\nRow1: \"2220\"\nRow2: \"2220\"\nRow3: \"8888\"\nRow4: \"0011\"\nRow5: \"0011\"\nRow6: \"2222\" (Yes, row6 changed)\nRow7: \"2222\" (from row7 input \"8888\"? Wait, let's check row7 input: \"8888\" becomes \"2222\")\nRow8: \"0110\" remains \"0110\"\nRow9: \"8800\" remains \"8800\"\nRow10:\"1111\" becomes \"2222\"\nRow11:\"0880\" remains \"0880\"\nRow12:\"0880\" remains \"0880\"\nRow13:\"1111\" remains \"1111\"\nRow14:\"8880\" becomes \"2220\"\nRow15:\"8880\" becomes \"2220\"\nRow16:\"0111\" remains \"0111\"\nRow17:\"0111\" remains \"0111\"\nRow18:\"8880\" remains \"8880\"\nRow19:\"0220\" is output? Let's re-read E.g. 3 Output from prompt:\nE.g. 3 Output:\n2220\n2220\n8888\n0011\n0011\n2222\n2222\n0110\n8800\n2222\n0880\n0880\n1111\n2220\n2220\n0111\n0111\n8880", "prompt_tokens": 879, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Compare:\n0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:6,\n5:0,6:0,7:0,8:4,9:0,\n10:6,11:0,12:4,13:0,14:0,\n15:6,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:0.\nSo difference: at position 12, input had 0, output has 4. So row11 changed a 0 to 4.\nRow12: \"0000604406000060000\" vs \"0000604406044060000\". Let's check row12: input: \"0000604406000060000\", output: \"0000604406044060000\". Compare: They are similar except maybe at position? Let's index row12: \"0000604406000060000\". Count: positions: 0-4: \"00006\", then \"4440\" maybe? Let's do: \"0000604406000060000\". Actually, let me count: \"00006\" (positions 0-4), then \"4440\" (positions 5-8) then \"60000\" (positions 9-13) then \"60000\" (positions 14-19). But output row12: \"0000604406044060000\". Let's index: positions 0-4: \"00006\", positions 5-8: \"4440\", positions 9-12: \"6044\", positions 13-19: \"06000\". So difference: In input, positions 9-13 are \"60000\", in output, they are \"60440\". So row12 changed \"60000\" to \"60440\". \nRow13: \"0000600406000060000\" vs \"0000600406040060000\". Compare: similar to row11, difference at position 12: input had 0, output has 4.\nRow14: \"0000600046000060000\" vs \"0000600046400060000\". Compare: difference: input row14: \"0000600046000060000\", output row14: \"0000600046400060000\". So difference: at position? Let's index row14: \"0000600046000060000\". Count: positions: 0-4: \"00006\", then \"0004\", then \"06000\", then \"60000\". Output row14: \"0000600046400060000\". So difference: at position 12, input had 0, output has 4? Let's check: Actually, let's index row14: \nInput row14: digits: 0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,4,6,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0.\nOutput row14: 0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,4,6,4,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0.\nSo difference: at position 12, input 0 becomes 4.\nRow15: \"666666", "prompt_tokens": 1179, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's count: The first line \"000000000000000000000\" is 20 digits. So grid is 20x20. The output grid is also 20x20. The transformation rule: It seems that some digits are replaced by other digits. For instance, in the output, we see digits like 7, 6, 4, 2, 8, 9, etc. The input digits are mostly 0, but some are nonzero: 4, 3, 6, 2, 8, 8, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 9, etc. Let's try to map input digits to output digits. Look at positions where input had nonzero digits.\n\nLet's list positions with nonzero digits in Example 1 input:\nRow 2 (0-indexed row 1): \"000000000000040000000\" -> digit 4 at column 13? Actually, let's index columns from 0 to 19. So row1, col? Actually, let's re-read: The first row is row0: \"000000000000000000000\" all zeros.\nRow1: \"000000000000040000000\" -> there is a '4' at column? Counting: \"0000000000000\" (12 zeros) then \"4\" then \"0000000\" (7 zeros) so column index 12? Actually, let's count: \"000000000000\" is 12 zeros, then \"4\", then \"0000000\" is 7 zeros, so total length 12+1+7=20. So the nonzero digit is at (1,12) = 4.\nRow3: \"000300000060000000000\" -> digits: there is a '3' at col? \"0003\" then \"00000\" then \"6\" then \"0000000000\"? Let's count: \"0003\" means col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=3, then \"00000\" means col4=0, col5=0, col6=0, col7=0, col8=0, then \"6\" at col9, then \"0000000000\" (10 zeros) so row3: (3,3)=3, (3,9)=6.\nRow7: \"002000000880088000000\" -> digits: \"00\" then \"2\" then \"0000000\" then \"880088\" then \"000000\". Let's count: row7: \"00\" (col0, col1=0), col2=2, then col3-? Let's count carefully: \"002000000880088000000\"\nBreak it: \"00\" (cols0-1), \"2\" (col2), then \"0000000\" (cols3-9 are zeros), then \"880088\" (cols10-15: digits: 8,8,0,0,8,8) then \"000000\" (cols16-21 but grid is 20 columns, so must re-check count). Let's count digits: The string length is 20. Let's count manually: characters: \nIndex: 0:0,1:0,2:2,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:8,11:8,12:0,13:0,14:8,15:8,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:0.\nSo row7: nonzero digits: col2=2, col10=8, col11=8, col12=0? Actually col12 is 0, col13=0, col14=8, col15=8. So nonzero: 2 at (7,2), 8 at (7,10), 8 at (7,11), 8 at (7,14), 8 at (7,15). \nRow8: \"000000000800008000000\" -> digits: \"000000000\" then \"8\" then \"00000\" then \"8\" then \"000000\". So row8: nonzero: col9=8, col14=8.\nRow9: \"000000000000000007000\" -> digits: \"0000000000000000\" then \"7\" then \"000\". So row9: nonzero: col16=7? Let's count: row9: first 16 zeros then \"7\" then \"000\". Actually, count: \"0000000000000000\" is 16 zeros, then \"7\" at col16, then \"000\" at col17, col18, col19. So row9: (9,16)=7.\nRow11: \"000040000000000000000\" -> digits: \"00004\" then \"0000000000000000\". So row11: nonzero: col4=4.\nRow13: \"000000000700008000900\" -> digits: \"000000000\" then \"7\" then \"00000\" then \"8\" then \"000\" then \"9\" then \"00\"? Let's count: row13: \"000000000\" (first 9 zeros), then \"7\" at col9, then \"00000\" (cols10-14 zeros), then \"8\" at col15, then \"000\" (cols16-18 zeros), then \"9\" at col19, then \"00\" but wait, length is 20, so maybe it's \"000000000700008000900\" is 20 digits? Let's count: \"000000000\" (9 digits) then \"7\" (10th), then \"00000\" (15 digits) then \"8\" (16th) then \"000\" (19th) then \"9\" (20th) then \"00\" would be extra. Let's re-read: \"000000000700008000900\". Count manually: \nCharacters: \n0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:7,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:8,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:9, then \"00\" is extra? Actually, the string length is 20, so indices 0 to 19. So row13: nonzero: col10=7, col15=8, col19=9.\nRow14: \"000000000770088000000\" ->", "prompt_tokens": 1849, "completion_tokens": 2048}

That means that columns 3,4,5,6,7,8? Let's check: \"0003003030\" is 10 digits. The pattern \"3003030\" appears in the middle. Actually, let's index columns: positions 0,1,2,3,...9. In output row3, digits: index0:0, index1:0, index2:0, index3:3, index4:0, index5:3, index6:0, index7:3, index8:0, index9:0? Wait, let's re-read: \"0003003030\" digits: 0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,3,0. But wait, check carefully: \"0003003030\" if we break it: \"000\" then \"3003030\" then \"0\"? Actually, let's count: \"0003003030\" is 10 digits. Let's index: \ncol0: '0'\ncol1: '0'\ncol2: '0'\ncol3: '3'\ncol4: '0'\ncol5: '0'\ncol6: '3'\ncol7: '0'\ncol8: '3'\ncol9: '0'\nSo pattern: 000, then 3,0,0, then 3,0,3, then 0. But wait, that doesn't look symmetric. Let's re-read the provided output exactly: \"0003003030\". It might be \"0003003030\" exactly. Let me check: \"0003003030\" if I group: \"000\" then \"300\" then \"303\" then \"0\"? That doesn't look consistent. Let's re-read the problem statement: \"E.g. 1 Output: 8880000000, 0000000000, 0000000000, 0003003030, 0003003030, 0003003030, 5555555555, 0000000000, 8643473837, 0000000000\". So rows 3,4,5 are changed. They become \"0003003030\". So the transformation is applied to rows 3,4,5. But why these rows? Possibly because they are in the middle of the grid? The grid is 10 rows.

So row5 got \"1\" inserted at column? Let's check: \"0000010000\": digits: index0:0, index1:0, index2:0, index3:0, index4:0, index5:1, index6:0, index7:0, index8:0, index9:0. So a single \"1\" appears at column5. And note that row5 is the 6th row (0-indexed row5). In E.g. 1, the changed rows were rows 3,4,5. In E.g. 2, the changed row is row5 only. So the transformation seems to be applied to a specific row or rows that are determined by the input grid's content? Possibly the transformation is applied to the row that is exactly in the middle of the grid? But then E.g. 3:\n\nE.g. 3:\nInput:\nRow0: 8880000000\nRow1: 0000000000\nRow2: 0000000000\nRow3: 0000000000\nRow4: 0000000000\nRow5: 0000000000\nRow6: 5555555555\nRow7: 0000000000\nRow8: 4144631636\nRow9: 0000000000\n\nOutput:\nRow0: 8880000000\nRow1: 0000000000\nRow2: 0000000000\nRow3: 4044600606\nRow4: 4044600606\nRow5: 4044600606\nRow6: 5555555555\nRow7: 0000000000\nRow8: 4144631636\nRow9: 0000000000\n\nDifference: rows 3,4,5 changed to \"4044600606\". So pattern: \"4044600606\". Let's index: digits: 0,4,4,4,6,0,0,6,0,6? Wait, let's check: \"4044600606\" if we break: maybe it's \"404\", \"460\", \"060\", \"6\"? Not sure. Let's count digits: \"4044600606\" is 10 digits. Let's index: col0: '4', col1: '0', col2: '4', col3: '4', col4: '6', col5: '0', col6: '0', col7: '6', col8: '0', col9: '6'. So pattern: 4,0,4,4,6,0,0,6,0,6. Compare with E.g. 1: row3 output was \"0003003030\". They are different. So the transformation rule might depend on the digits in the top row or bottom row? Let's check the top row of E.g. 1 is \"8880000000\", E.g. 2 is \"8000000000\", E.g. 3 is \"8880000000\", E.g. 4 is \"8800000000\", E.g. 5 is \"8888000000\", E.g. 6 is \"8000000000\". And the bottom row (row8) in each example: E.g. 1: \"8643473837\", E.g. 2: \"6646219294\", E.g. 3: \"4144631636\", E.g. 4: \"2332311311\", E.g. 5: \"2121211222\", E.g. 6: \"1311114111\". And the middle row (row6) is always \"5555555555\". So the transformation seems to be applied to some rows in the middle of the grid, not the top or bottom rows. Which rows are changed? In E.g. 1, rows 3,4,5 changed. In E.g. 2, row5 changed. In E.g. 3, rows 3,4,5 changed. In E.g. 4, rows? Let's check E.g. 4:\nInput:\nRow0: 8800000000\nRow1: 0000000000\nRow2:", "prompt_tokens": 1113, "completion_tokens": 2048}

{"task_id": "2697da3f", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus:free", "raw_response": "We are given an \"ARC\" puzzle. The problem is: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" We are provided with four examples and a test input.\n\nLet's re-read examples:\n\ne.g. 1:\nInput:\n7 rows? Actually, representation: \nE.g. 1 Input:\n0000000\n0444040\n0004440\n0000400\n0004440\n0444040\n0000000\n0000000\n0000000\n\nWait, check lines: There are 9 lines, each line is 7 characters? Actually, each line is provided. Let me re-read carefully.\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\nLine1: \"0000000\"\nLine2: \"0444040\"\nLine3: \"0004440\"\nLine4: \"0000400\"\nLine5: \"0004440\"\nLine6: \"0444040\"\nLine7: \"0000000\"\nLine8: \"0000000\"\nLine9: \"0000000\"\n\nOutput:\nLine1: \"000004000400000\"\nLine2: \"000004000400000\"\nLine3: \"000004404400000\"\nLine4: \"000000444000000\"\nLine5: \"000004404400000\"\nLine6: \"444040000040444\"\nLine7: \"004440000044400\"\nLine8: \"000400000004000\"\nLine9: \"004440000044400\"\nLine10:\"444040000040444\"\nLine11:\"000004404400000\"\nLine12:\"000000444000000\"\nLine13:\"000004404400000\"\nLine14:\"000004000400000\"\nLine15:\"000004000400000\"\n\nSo e.g. 1 input grid has 9 rows and each row is 7 columns. The output grid has 15 rows, each row 15 columns. So transformation increased grid dimension. Possibly the transformation is \"drawing a morphological dilation or some kind of pattern expansion\".\n\nLet's try to identify transformation pattern from examples.\n\nObserving examples: In e.g. 1, the input grid contains some pattern of 4's in a cross pattern? Actually, let's inspect carefully. The input grid for e.g. 1: It has a symmetric pattern of 4's, where 4's appear on diagonals? Actually, rows: row1: all 0's, row2: \"0444040\", row3: \"0004440\", row4: \"0000400\", row5: \"0004440\", row6: \"0444040\", row7: \"0000000\", then three rows of zeros \"0000000\". But in the output grid, there are a pattern of 4's forming diamond shapes? Let's inspect output grid pattern for e.g. 1: The output is a 15x15 grid, with many 0's except some patterns of 4's. It appears that the transformation rule might be a \"replication\" of the input pattern in a bigger grid, with some offset maybe. There is symmetry: The output grid is symmetric in vertical and horizontal directions. Possibly the transformation is \"reflection\" across vertical and horizontal axes, maybe \"ring\" or \"dilation\" shape.\n\nIdea: The transformation might involve taking a \"skeleton\" in the input grid and then \"thickening\" it in some way. The transformation might be \"drawing circles\" around the 4's maybe.\n\nLet's check e.g. 2:\nInput:\n0000000\n0000000\n0044000\n0404400\n0044000\n0000000\n0000000\n\nSo input grid: 7 rows, 7 columns.\nOutput:\n00000400000\n00004040000\n00004440000\n00000400000\n04400000440\n40440004404\n04400000440\n00000400000\n00004440000\n00004040000\n00000400000\n\nSo output grid is 11 rows, 11 columns. So again, grid expansion.\n\nObserving e.g. 2: In input, the pattern of 4's is in middle rows. The output pattern: There is a sort of \"diamond\" shape that is larger. It seems that the transformation might be \"morphological dilation\" with a diamond shape kernel. It might be \"drawing a circle\" around the ones? But the digits used: 0's and 4's. Possibly the rule is: \"Replace each 4 in the input with a cross pattern of 4's in the output grid, arranged in a symmetrical manner, and fill the rest with 0's.\" Or maybe the output grid is obtained by \"smoothing\" the input pattern with a fixed kernel.\n\nI recall some ARC tasks: \"Even more\", \"Stained Glass\" etc. But the pattern here: numbers 0 and 4. The output grids have lots of 0's, but then there are blocks of 4's arranged in diamond shapes.\n\nI recall a known ARC problem \"Building a pattern\" that has a transformation: \"Take a grid, and for every 4 in the input, place a 4 in the output in a pattern that is the sum of its adjacent ones\", or perhaps \"scaling by factor 3\".\n\nWait, I'll try to compare input and output sizes.\nFor e.g. 1: Input 7x7 -> Output 15x15. That is roughly doubling plus one. For e.g. 2: Input 7x7 -> Output 11x11. For e.g. 3: Input 8x8? Let's check e.g. 3:\nInput:\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00040400\n00444400\n00040400\n00000000\nSo input: 8 rows, 8 columns.\nOutput: \n00000400000  (11 columns, row1)\n00004440000 (row2)\n00000400000 (row3)\n00004440000 (row4)\n04040004040 (row5)\n44440004444 (row6)\n04040004040 (row7)\n00004440000 (row8)\n00000400000 (row9)\n00004440000 (row10)\n00000400000 (row11)\nSo output is 11 rows, 11 columns.\nFor e.g. 4:\nInput:\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n40004000\n40444000\n04400000\n40444000\n40004000\nSo input: 9 rows, 8 columns? Actually lines: first 3 lines are zeros, then \"40004000\", then \"40444000\", then \"04400000\", then \"40444000\", then \"40004000\". Wait, count rows: There are 9 lines total. And columns: They are 8 columns each.\nOutput:\n000004404400000 (15 columns, row1)\n000000040000000 (row2)\n000000444000000 (row3)\n000000404000000 (row4)\n000004404400000 (row5)\n400040000040004 (row6)\n404440000044404 (row7)\n044000000000440 (row8)\n404440000044404 (row9)\n400040000040004 (row10)\n000004404400000 (row11)\n000000404000000 (row12)\n000000444000000 (row13)\n000000040000000 (row14)\n000004404400000 (row15)\nSo output is 15 rows, 15 columns.\n\nSo it seems that the transformation rule scales the grid by some factor, but not uniformly: sometimes output grid dimensions are 15x15, sometimes 11x11, sometimes 15x15. Let's check: e.g. 1: input 7x7 output 15x15. e.g. 2: input 7x7 output 11x11. e.g. 3: input 8x8 output 11x11. e.g. 4: input 9x8 output 15x15.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Given an input grid, output a grid that is the result of taking each cell of the input grid and placing a pattern of size 3x3 (or maybe 3 in width, 3 in height) around it, where the center is the input's cell, and the surrounding are determined by the neighboring differences. But then the pattern would be scaled factor 3 minus 1 = 2 difference. But 7*3=21, not 15. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is: \"Take the input grid, and draw a 'thick' border of 0's, and then embed the input grid in the center, and then write the 4's in a pattern that is the \"mirror\" of the input's 4's in a diamond shape.\"\n\nI recall a known ARC puzzle \"Stained Glass\" sometimes. Alternatively, check pattern differences: In e.g. 1, output row3: \"000004404400000\". The center part \"0444\" appears. In input row 3: \"0004440\". Notice that the output row3 has \"00000\" then \"444\" then \"400000\". It seems like the pattern has been \"blown up\" by a factor of 3 (or maybe factor 2, then added boundaries). Also, the output seems symmetric horizontally and vertically. Possibly the rule is: \"Expand the grid by 2 rows on each side and 2 columns on each side, and then replicate the pattern of 4", "prompt_tokens": 889, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We have E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, and a final \"Test Input\". Our goal: \"deduce the hidden transformation rule from examples and apply it to the final test input grid to produce the correct output grid.\"\n\nWe are provided with several pairs of input and output examples. We need to determine the hidden transformation rule from these examples. Let's denote the examples as grid images with coordinates etc. Let's analyze each example.\n\nWe have also instructions: \"Output concise reasoning in <thinking>\" with 5 or less steps, then output final test grid as JSON list of lists.\n\nWe are given examples as E.g. 1 Input grid, E.g. 1 Output grid, etc.\n\nI need to determine transformation rule - likely there is a pattern of reading non-zero numbers and counting something? Possibly the output grid is a \"hash\" of the input grid's digit groups. Let me recast the examples as \"Before\" / \"After\".\n\nWe have Example 1 input grid: lines:\n\nRow lines (maybe grid is 15 rows x 16 columns? Let's count: E.g. 1 Input has lines: \n1: \"8888800000000000\"\n2: \"8888800000000000\"\n3: \"8888800088880000\"\n4: \"8888800088880000\"\n5: \"8888800088880000\"\n6: \"0000000088880000\"\n7: \"0000000000000000\"\n8: \"0000088880011000\"\n9: \"0000088880011000\"\n10: \"0000088880000000\"\n11: \"0000088880000000\"\n12: \"0220000000000000\"\n13: \"0220000222000000\"\n14: \"0000000222000000\"\n15: \"0000000222000000\"\n16: \"0000000000000000\"\n\nAnd output grid E.g. 1 Output is:\nRow1: \"888\"\nRow2: \"022\"\nRow3: \"001\"\n\nSo the transformation: from a 16x16 input grid (16 rows x 16 columns) to an output grid 3x? Wait check: The output grid is a 3x? It is \"888\", \"022\", \"001\". That is 3 rows and 3 columns? Actually \"888\" is 3 characters. \"022\" is 3 characters, \"001\" is 3 characters. So output grid size is 3x3.\n\nSimilarly, E.g. 2 Input grid: There are 16 lines? Let's count lines: E.g. 2 Input lines:\n1: \"0000000044000220\"\n2: \"0002220044000220\"\n3: \"0002220000000000\"\n4: \"0002220000222000\"\n5: \"0000000000222000\"\n6: \"0000003300222000\"\n7: \"8888003300000000\"\n8: \"8888000000002222\"\n9: \"8888000333002222\"\n10: \"8888000333002222\"\n11: \"0000000333002222\"\n12: \"0008800000000000\"\n13: \"0008800000000000\"\n14: \"0000000000003300\"\n15: \"0000000000003300\"\n16: \"0000000000000000\"\n\nOutput grid E.g. 2 Output is:\n\"2222\" then \"0333\" then \"0088\" then \"0004\". So 4 rows, 4 columns.\n\nE.g. 3 Input grid: It has 16 lines? Let's count: Yes, 16 lines.\nE.g. 3 Output: \n\"11111\" then \"00888\" then \"00022\" then \"00003\". So output grid is 4 rows x 5 columns.\n\nSo the transformation rule from a 16x16 grid to a smaller grid? Possibly the output grid is produced by segmenting the input grid into blocks and counting non-zero digits? Wait, maybe the output grid is the \"outline\" or \"bounding box\" of certain patterns? Let's analyze patterns.\n\nObserving E.g. 1: The input grid has digits '8' in top rows and '0' in many places. There is a block of \"8888\" in the left block? Possibly the transformation is: \"Given a grid, find the columns and rows that contain at least one non-zero digit, then shrink the grid to those bounding coordinates and then remove all zeros?\" Let's check: E.g. 1 Input: The grid is 16 columns and 16 rows. The output has dimension 3x3. Which rows in input are used? Possibly the transformation is \"find the top-left and bottom-right non-zero coordinates and extract that subgrid\" but that doesn't match because pattern: E.g. 1 Output \"888\" in top row. The input top row left part is \"8888\", but then they only took three columns? Wait, let me re-read the provided output grid \"888\" \"022\" \"001\" and compare with input grid regions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is: \"Find connected groups of digits, then compute the sum of digits in each group?\" That doesn't look like the output.\n\nMaybe it's a simple \"digit replacement\" in cells that are nonzero? Possibly the rule is \"For each cell in the input grid, count how many distinct numbers appear in its row?\" No.\n\nMaybe the rule is \"reduction\" along rows and columns, like summing along diagonals? Let's try to see structure. E.g. 1: The output grid is 3 rows x 3 columns. And it is:\nRow1: 8,8,8\nRow2: 0,2,2\nRow3: 0,0,1\n\nWhat do these numbers correspond to? Possibly the number in the output cell equals the count of occurrences of that digit in a corresponding subregion of the input grid? For instance, in row1 of output \"888\", maybe each digit is the maximum digit encountered in some column block of the input grid? But \"8\" is the maximum digit in many blocks.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Read the grid column-wise from the input grid and then compress by taking the distinct nonzero digits from each column's path, or maybe by reading diagonally?\" Alternatively, maybe the rule is \"Find the central shape in the grid and then output its border.\" For instance, E.g. 1: The input grid has two blocks: one block of 8's and one block of 0's and then a block of 2's and 1's? Let me inspect the input grid structure for E.g. 1:\n\nRows 1-3: They are \"8888800000000000\", \"8888800000000000\", \"8888800088880000\", \"8888800088880000\", \"8888800088880000\". So top left block: columns 1-5 are 8's, and columns 6-10 are 0's? Actually, check row1: \"88888\" then \"00000000000\" but actually \"8888800000000000\" is 16 characters long. Let's index columns 1-indexed:\n\nRow1: [1:8,2:8,3:8,4:8,5:8,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:0].\nRow2: same as row1.\nRow3: \"8888800088880000\": so columns 1-5 are 8's, columns 6-9 are 0's, columns 10-13 are 8's, columns 14-16 are 0's.\nRow4: same as row3.\nRow5: same as row3.\n\nThen row6: \"0000000088880000\": columns 1-6 are 0's, columns 7-10 are 8's, columns 11-16 are 0's.\nRow7: \"0000000000000000\": all 0's.\nRow8: \"0000088880011000\": columns 1-6 0's, columns 7-10 8's, columns 11-12 0? Actually, let's parse row8: \"00000\" then \"8\", then \"8888\", then \"0011\", then \"000\". Actually, let's count: \"0000088880011000\": It is 16 digits. Let's break: 00000 (first 5 zeros), then 8, then 8888 (4 digits?) Actually, let's count carefully: \"0000088880011000\": count digits: 0,0,0,0,0, then 8, then 8,8,8,8, then 0,0, then 1,1, then 0,0,0. That sums to 5+1+4+2+3 = 15? Wait, that's not correct. Let's count carefully: There are exactly 16 digits because each line is 16 digits. I'll count manually: \"0000088880011000\": characters: \nchar1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:0,11:0,12:1,13:1,14:0,15:0,16:0.\nSo row8:", "prompt_tokens": 899, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" Then examples are provided.\n\nLet's re-read examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n\"223\"\n\"555\"\n\"000\"\nOutput:\n\"223\"\n\"555\"\n\"020\"\n\nSo, in example 1, input grid rows:\nRow1: \"223\"\nRow2: \"555\"\nRow3: \"000\"\nOutput grid rows:\nRow1: \"223\" (unchanged)\nRow2: \"555\" (unchanged)\nRow3: \"020\" (changed)\n\nComparing row3: input \"000\" becomes \"020\". What transformation? Possibly count of something? We see that row3 has three zeros, but output row3 is \"020\". Maybe it's a transformation where the last digit is replaced with a count of zeros? But not sure.\n\nWait, look at the output row3: \"020\". The first digit is 0, second digit is 2, third digit is 0. Possibly the number 2 in the middle is the count of something? Possibly count of something in row? Let's check others.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n\"36424\"\n\"84334\"\n\"55555\"\n\"00000\"\n\"00000\"\nOutput:\n\"36424\"\n\"84334\"\n\"55555\"\n\"00000\"\n\"00400\"\n\nComparing row4: \"00000\" becomes \"00400\"? Possibly transformation is: in row4, we have 5 zeros. But output row4 is \"00400\". It starts with two zeros, then a 4, then two zeros. Similarly row3 remains \"55555\". Wait, check row3: \"55555\" remains same.\nWait, check row2: \"84334\" remains same.\nWait, check row1: \"36424\" remains same.\nSo only the rows that are entirely zeros are changed? Let's check row? Actually, in example 1, only the bottom row \"000\" is changed to \"020\". In example 2, the bottom two rows \"00000\" are only changed the last one from \"00000\" to \"00400\", but what about the row above \"00000\"? Actually, look at example 2: It has 5 rows. The rows are: row1 \"36424\", row2 \"84334\", row3 \"55555\", row4 \"00000\", row5 \"00000\". And output: row1 same, row2 same, row3 same, row4 same \"00000\", row5 changed \"00400\". So transformation applies to only some rows that are entirely zeros? But wait, in example 1, bottom row \"000\" is changed to \"020\". In example 2, the bottom row \"00000\" is changed to \"00400\"? But row4 remains unchanged \"00000\", row5 becomes \"00400\". In example 3: Let's check.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n\"1996184\"\n\"4678971\"\n\"9314136\"\n\"5555555\"\n\"0000000\"\n\"0000000\"\n\"0000000\"\nOutput:\n\"1996184\"\n\"4678971\"\n\"9314136\"\n\"5555555\"\n\"0000000\"\n\"0000000\"\n\"0001000\"\n\nLet's check. We have 7 rows. The input rows:\nRow1: \"1996184\"\nRow2: \"4678971\"\nRow3: \"9314136\"\nRow4: \"5555555\"\nRow5: \"0000000\"\nRow6: \"0000000\"\nRow7: \"0000000\"\nOutput:\nRow1 same, row2 same, row3 same, row4 same, row5 same, row6 same, row7 changed to \"0001000\".\n\nSo pattern: In each example, only one row (the bottom row) is transformed? But in example 2, which row is transformed? There are 5 rows. The input bottom row is row5 \"00000\" becomes \"00400\". But in example 1, which row? There are 3 rows: bottom row \"000\" becomes \"020\". In example 3, bottom row \"0000000\" becomes \"0001000\". But wait, check example 2: But then row4 \"00000\" remains unchanged. So why would one row be changed and another not?\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: In each grid, find the row that is \"all zeros\" that is furthest from the top? But in example 1, the grid has three rows and the bottom row is zeros. In example 2, the grid has five rows, but two rows at bottom are zeros? But then, which one gets changed? In example 2, row5 is changed to \"00400\", but row4 (the one above it) remains \"00000\". In example 3, there are three rows of zeros at bottom, but only the bottom-most row is changed.\n\nMaybe the rule is: For each grid, find the bottom-most row that is entirely zeros. Then, modify that row by replacing the center digit with the count of zeros in that row? Let's check: In example 1, row \"000\" has three zeros. The center digit becomes 2? But \"000\" has three zeros, so count is 3, but then the middle digit becomes 2, not 3. In example 2, row \"00000\" has five zeros, but the center digit becomes 4, which is not 5. In example 3, row \"0000000\" has seven zeros, but the center digit becomes 1, not 7. So not that.\n\nMaybe it's: in each grid, the bottom row that is entirely zeros gets a marker inserted in the middle column indicating something like \"the number of contiguous zeros\"? But then in example 1, the output \"020\" - if we consider \"000\", then maybe the rule is: \"Replace the leftmost and rightmost zeros with zero and the middle digit with the number of rows in the grid minus 1\"? That doesn't match either.\n\nMaybe the transformation involves counting something from the entire grid? Let's check the difference between input and output rows. In example 1, rows 1-2 are unchanged, row3 changed \"000\" -> \"020\". The difference is that the middle digit becomes 2. In example 2, row5 \"00000\" -> \"00400\". The difference: the middle digit becomes 4. In example 3, row7 \"0000000\" -> \"0001000\". The difference: the digit in position 4 (zero-indexed third?) Let's check positions: For a row of length 7, index positions: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. In output \"0001000\", the digit '1' is in the 4th position (index 3 if 0-indexed, or 4th if 1-indexed). For row of length 5, index positions: \"00400\", the digit '4' is in the 3rd position (index 2 if 0-indexed, or 3 if 1-indexed). For row of length 3, \"020\", the digit '2' is in the middle (index 1). So maybe the rule is: In the bottom-most row that is entirely zeros (or maybe the row with all zeros that is at the bottom of the grid), change the middle digit to equal the row's width (or something) minus 2? Let's check: For row length 3, maybe the new digit is 2 because 3 - 1 = 2? For row length 5, new digit is 4 because 5 - 1 = 4? For row length 7, new digit is 1? That doesn't match 7-1 =6, but we got 1. So maybe the new digit is not simply row length minus 1.\n\nMaybe it's the count of zeros on either side? For row \"000\": left side zeros count = 1, right side zeros count = 1, sum = 2? For row \"00000\": left side zeros count = 2, right side zeros count = 2, sum = 4? For row \"0000000\": left side zeros count = 3, right side zeros count = 3, sum = 6, but output digit is 1, not 6. So maybe not.\n\nMaybe it's the count of zeros that are contiguous to something? Let's re-read examples:\n\nPossibly the transformation is applied to the bottom-most row that is completely blank (all zeros) and then the rule is: \"Replace the row with: keep the first and last digits as 0, then place the number of zeros in that row minus 2 in the middle\"? For row \"000\", number of zeros=3, minus 2 gives 1, but output middle digit is 2, not 1. For row \"00000\", number of zeros=5, minus 2 gives 3, but output middle digit is 4. For row \"0000000\", number of zeros=7, minus 2 gives 5, but output digit is 1. So that's not it.\n\nMaybe the transformation relates to the number of rows in the grid that are non-zero vs zero rows. In example 1, grid has 3 rows, and the bottom row is all zeros, and is replaced with \"020\". The digit in the middle is", "prompt_tokens": 555, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Actually the input is 3 rows of 3 digits each. But the output grid is 9 rows x 9 digits each. It appears that the transformation is applied to each row of the input, replication of row pattern in output rows? Let's analyze structure:\n\nFor E.g. 1, input rows:\nRow 1: \"881\"\nRow 2: \"861\"\nRow 3: \"496\"\n\nOutput grid: It is 9 rows. Let's see how they are arranged:\n\nRow 1: \"881881000\" \nRow 2: \"861861000\"\nRow 3: \"496496000\"\nRow 4: \"881000000\"\nRow 5: \"861000000\"\nRow 6: \"496000000\"\nRow 7: \"000000000\"\nRow 8: \"000000000\"\nRow 9: \"000000000\"\n\nObserving pattern: It appears that the output grid is constructed by three \"blocks\" of three rows each. The top block consists of the original rows with the row repeated as if concatenated with itself then appended with zeros? Wait, let's check row 1: \"881\" becomes \"881881000\". But note that output is 9 columns.\n\nLet's analyze row 1: \"881\" becomes \"881881000\". So the first two segments \"881\" \"881\" then \"000\". Similarly, row 2: \"861\" becomes \"861861000\" and row 3: \"496\" becomes \"496496000\". So top block: each input row is repeated twice, then followed by \"000\". So each top block row has pattern: input row, input row, then zeros. But then row 4: \"881000000\"? Wait, row 4 is \"881000000\". That is not a repetition of row 1? Wait, row 4: starts with \"881\". Actually, check structure: The output grid 9 rows. I see a block structure:\nBlock 1 (rows 1-3): Each row is \"input row\" followed by \"input row\" then \"000\".\nBlock 2 (rows 4-6): Each row is \"input row\" then \"000\" then \"000\" (so the first three digits of the row then zeros)? But row 4: \"881000000\" is the input row \"881\" followed by two groups of \"000\"? I see pattern: Actually, wait, check row 4: \"881000000\": It equals \"881\" + \"000\" + \"000\"? Because \"881\" is the first input row? But then row 5: \"861000000\", row 6: \"496000000\". So block 2: Each row is input row, then zeros, then zeros. And block 3 (rows 7-9): They are all zeros, but maybe they are \"000\" repeated 3 times? But row 7: \"000000000\" is 3 groups of \"000\". So pattern: The output grid is 9 columns and 9 rows.\n\nObserving block sizes: The grid is 9 rows, which is 3 blocks of 3 rows each. And each row is 9 columns, which is 3 groups of 3 columns each. So grid is partitioned into 3x3 blocks, each of size 3x3. Now, look at the transformation in terms of blocks maybe:\n\nFor E.g. 1, input is 3x3 (with each row is considered as a horizontal block of 3 digits). The output is 9x9, partitioned into 9 blocks of 3x3. The pattern seems to be: The top-left 3x3 block (first block) contains the input grid repeated in the top row? Wait, let's see mapping: The output grid is arranged with blocks as follows (each block is 3x3):\n\nBlock arrangement: Let's label output blocks by their row block index i from 0 to 2 and column block index j from 0 to 2. So output is a 3x3 array of blocks.\n\nE.g. 1: If we partition output into 3x3 blocks of size 3 columns x 3 rows, then the blocks are:\n\nBlock (0,0): rows 1-3, columns 1-3, which is:\nRow1: \"881\"\nRow2: \"861\"\nRow3: \"496\"\nThis is exactly the input grid.\n\nBlock (0,1): rows 1-3, columns 4-6, which is:\nRow1: \"881\"\nRow2: \"861\"\nRow3: \"496\"\nAgain, same as input.\nBlock (0,2): rows 1-3, columns 7-9, which is:\nRow1: \"000\"\nRow2: \"000\"\nRow3: \"000\"\nSo row block 0 (top three rows) is: first two blocks are repetition of input grid, third block is zeros.\n\nNow block (1,0): rows 4-6, columns 1-3, which is:\nRow4: \"881\"\nRow5: \"861\"\nRow6: \"496\"\nThis is the input grid again? But wait, check row 4: \"881\", row 5: \"861\", row 6: \"496\". But that is the same as input? But then block (1,1): rows 4-6, columns 4-6, which is:\nRow4: \"000\"\nRow5: \"000\"\nRow6: \"000\"\nBlock (1,2): rows 4-6, columns 7-9, \"000\" each row.\nSo row block 1 becomes: first block is input, then two zeros blocks.\n\nBlock (2,0): rows 7-9, columns 1-3, which is:\nRow7: \"000\"\nRow8: \"000\"\nRow9: \"000\"\nBlock (2,1): rows 7-9, columns 4-6: zeros.\nBlock (2,2): rows 7-9, columns 7-9: zeros.\n\nSo pattern: The output grid is 9x9. The top block row (blocks (0,0) and (0,1)) come from the input grid, and the bottom block row (block row 1) has first block from input, then zeros, and the bottom block row (block row 2) is all zeros.\n\nWait, let's re-read the output for example 1 carefully:\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nRow1: 881881000\nRow2: 861861000\nRow3: 496496000\nRow4: 881000000\nRow5: 861000000\nRow6: 496000000\nRow7: 000000000\nRow8: 000000000\nRow9: 000000000\n\nLet's break rows into groups of 3 columns:\nRows 1-3:\nBlock A: \"881\" | \"881\" | \"000\"\nBlock B: \"881\" | \"861\" | \"000\"\nBlock C: \"496\" | \"496\" | \"000\" Wait, check row 1: \"881881000\" -> group columns: \"881\", \"881\", \"000\". Row 2: \"861861000\" -> \"861\", \"861\", \"000\". Row 3: \"496496000\" -> \"496\", \"496\", \"000\".\n\nRows 4-6:\nRow4: \"881000000\" -> groups: \"881\", \"000\", \"000\".\nRow5: \"861000000\" -> groups: \"861\", \"000\", \"000\".\nRow6: \"496000000\" -> groups: \"496\", \"000\", \"000\".\n\nRows 7-9:\nAll zeros: groups: \"000\", \"000\", \"000\" repeated.\n\nSo the transformation looks like: The input grid (3x3) is repeated in two different positions in the output grid. But the output grid is 9x9, which is 3 times as many rows and columns. We need to deduce the transformation rule from all examples.\n\nLet's check E.g. 2:\nE.g. 2 Input:\n771\n471\n337\n\nE.g. 2 Output:\nRow1: 771771000\nRow2: 471471000\nRow3: 337337000\nRow4: 000771000\nRow5: 000471000\nRow6: 000337000\nRow7: 000000771\nRow8: 000000471\nRow9: 000000337\n\nBreak into 3x3 blocks (each block 3 columns wide):\nRows 1-3:\nBlock A: \"771\", \"471\", \"337\"\nBlock B: \"771\", \"471\", \"337\"\nBlock C: \"000\", \"000\", \"000\"\nRows 4-6:\nBlock A: \"000\", \"000\", \"000\"\nBlock B: \"771\", \"471\", \"337\"\nBlock C: \"000\", \"000\", \"000\"\nRows 7-9:\nBlock A: \"000\", \"000\", \"000\"\nBlock B: \"000\", \"000\", \"000\"\nBlock C: \"771\", \"471\", \"337\"\n\nSo pattern", "prompt_tokens": 609, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Actually, check the digits:\nRow 1: \"8880355503999034444\" -> 16 digits.\nRow 2: \"8080355553990930000\" -> 16 digits.\nRow 3: \"0008355003000030440\" -> 16 digits.\nRow 4: \"0800305553900034444\" -> 16 digits.\n\nThe output is:\nRow 1: \"9994\"\nRow 2: \"9989\"\nRow 3: \"5448\"\nRow 4: \"9444\"\n\nSo the output grid is 4 rows, but only 4 digits per row. So it seems transformation is from a 4x16 grid to a 4x4 grid.\n\nMaybe rule: Sum columns? But if we look at row 1 of output, \"9994\". Possibly each digit is computed from corresponding 4 columns? But then how to break up the 16-digit row? Possibly process each 4x4 block? But then the transformation rule across examples might be: \"Replace each 4-digit block by a summary digit computed from some function of the digits.\" But let me check: In example 1 input: row1: \"8880355503999034444\". If we break into 4 groups of 4 digits each: \"8880\", \"3555\", \"0399\", \"03444\"? That doesn't work since last group is 4 digits? Actually, 16 digits divided by 4 gives 4 groups of 4 digits. Let's split row1 into groups of 4: Group1: \"8880\", Group2: \"3555\", Group3: \"3999\", Group4: \"03444\"? Wait, 16 digits, so groups of 4 should be exactly 4 groups, each with 4 digits. Let's check: 16/4 = 4 groups: positions [0:4], [4:8], [8:12], [12:16]. So group them:\nRow1: \"8880\", \"3555\", \"3999\", \"03444\"? Wait, I have to recalc: For row1, \"8880355503999034444\" digits: \nIndex: 0-3: 8880, index 4-7: 3555, index 8-11: 3999, index 12-15: 03444? Let's count: 16-digit string, groups of 4: group1: digits0-3: \"8880\", group2: digits4-7: \"3555\", group3: digits8-11: \"3999\", group4: digits12-15: \"03444\"? Wait, 12 to 15 is 4 digits, so it is \"03444\"? Let's count: the string \"8880355503999034444\", if we break into 4 groups, each group should have exactly 4 digits. Let's do: \nGroup1: indices 0-3: \"8880\"\nGroup2: indices 4-7: \"3555\"\nGroup3: indices 8-11: \"3999\"\nGroup4: indices 12-15: \"03444\"? That doesn't add up because 12 to 15 is 4 digits, so it should be \"03444\"? Let's count: the string \"8880355503999034444\" is 16 digits. Let me count manually:\nCharacters: \n1:8\n2:8\n3:8\n4:0\n5:3\n6:5\n7:5\n8:5\n9:0\n10:3\n11:9\n12:9\n13:9\n14:0\n15:3\n16:4\n17:4\n18:4\nWait, it's 18 digits? But wait, the provided string \"8880355503999034444\" count: \nMaybe it's 16 digits, but I'm counting extra digits. Let's count carefully:\n\"8880355503999034444\" \nI'll count: \n8,8,8,0,3,5,5,5,0,3,9,9,9,0,3,4,4,4? That appears to be 18 digits. But the output is 4 digits per row, so the input grid is 4 rows of 16 digits if we assume consistency across examples. \nMaybe I mis-read: The examples are given as lines that are strings of digits and the actual grid is not necessarily rectangular? Let's re-read the problem statement: \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then lines. They might be interpreted as a grid with each line representing a row. So each row has a string of digits. And the output grid has each row as a string of digits. But then the number of columns in output should be equal to the number of columns in input? But here output rows have 4 digits while input rows have 16 digits (given in example 1). So what is the transformation? It might be that the grid is 4 rows x 4 columns and each cell is a 4-digit number? But then output is 4 rows x 4 columns? But output rows are \"9994\", \"9989\", etc., which are 4-digit numbers. So perhaps the transformation is to take each cell of the 4x4 grid (which is encoded as a 4-digit string) and transform it to a new 1-digit number? \nLet's check: In E.g. 1, maybe each row of input is actually a concatenation of 4 cells, each cell is 4 digits. So the grid is 4 rows by 4 columns, and each cell is a 4-digit number. And the output grid is also 4 rows by 4 columns, but each cell is a single digit. And the transformation is applied cell-wise.\n\nLet's check: For E.g. 1, row1: \"8880355503999034444\". Divide into 4 groups of 4 digits each:\nGroup1: \"8880\", Group2: \"3555\", Group3: \"3999\", Group4: \"03444\"? Wait, that's not even. Let's properly split: It should be: \nFor a 4x4 grid, each cell has 4 digits, so total digits = 4*4 = 16. So each row string should have exactly 16 characters. So if we split row1 into 4 groups of 4, then group boundaries are at positions 0,4,8,12. So group1: indices 0-3: \"8880\", group2: indices 4-7: \"3555\", group3: indices 8-11: \"3999\", group4: indices 12-15: \"03444\"? Actually, I must check the digits exactly: \"8880355503999034444\". Let me count carefully: \nMaybe I'll count by grouping: \n\"8880\" is 4 digits, then next \"3555\" is 4 digits, next \"3999\" is 4 digits, and then remaining \"03444\"? That doesn't add up because 4+4+4 = 12, and 16 - 12 = 4, so the last group should be 4 digits. So it must be \"0344\" if the string is 16 digits. Let's try to re-read the provided string: \"8880355503999034444\". Possibly there is a misprint? Let's count manually:\n8 8 8 0  (group1: 8880)\n3 5 5 5  (group2: 3555)\n0 3 9 9  (group3: 0399?) Actually, group3: \"0399\" if we take next 4 digits after \"3555\": digits positions: 0:8,1:8,2:8,3:0; 4:3,5:5,6:5,7:5; 8:0,9:3,10:9,11:9; then group4: digits 12-15: \"903444\"? That doesn't divide evenly. Let me re-read: \"8880355503999034444\" has length? Count digits: \nMaybe I'll count: \n\"8880\" (4 digits) then \"3555\" (4 digits, now 8 digits total) then \"3999\" (4 digits, now 12 digits total) then \"03444\" (if that were 5 digits, then total 17 digits) but expected 16 digits. Possibly it's \"0344\" (4 digits) then the remaining digit \"4\"? That doesn't work.\n\nWait", "prompt_tokens": 759, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check: In the first row, input: \"8888888888\" becomes \"8882888888\". So the 4th digit changed from 8 to 2? Actually, let's check: row1: \"8888888888\" -> \"8882888888\". The difference is at index 3? Let's check indices: if we index from 0, then positions: 0:8,1:8,2:8,3:8,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8. Output: \"8882888888\": positions: 0:8,1:8,2:8,3:2,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8. So the 4th digit changed from 8 to 2. But then row2: \"8888888888\" -> \"8882888888\" same pattern. Row3: \"8118188888\" -> \"8112188888\". Let's check: row3: input: 8 1 1 8 1 8 8 8 8 8. Output: 8 1 1 2 1 8 8 8 8 8. So the 4th digit changed from 8 to 2. Row4: \"8188188888\" -> \"8122188888\". Let's check: row4: input: 8 1 8 1 8 1 8 8 8 8. Output: 8 1 2 2 1 8 8 8 8 8. So positions 2 and 3 changed? Let's check: index 2: originally 8 becomes 2, index 3: originally 1 becomes 2? Wait, check carefully: row4: input: \"8188188888\". Let's index: 0:8, 1:1, 2:8, 3:1, 4:8, 5:1, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8. Output: \"8122188888\": index: 0:8, 1:1, 2:2, 3:2, 4:1, 5:8, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8.

Row7: \"8888881111\" -> \"8888881111\" no change. Row8: \"8888881881\" -> \"8888881221\". Let's check: row8: input: 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 1. Output: 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 2 2 1. So changes: index7 changed from 8 to 2, index8 changed from 8 to 2.\nRow9: \"8888881881\" -> \"8888881221\" same as row8.\nRow10: \"8888881181\" -> \"8888881121\". Let's check: row10: input: 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 8 1. Output: 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 2 1. So change: index8 changed from 8 to 2.\nRow11: \"8888888888\" -> \"8888888828\".

But what is the pattern? Let's check example 2:\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n555555555\n555555555\n551111555\n551551555\n555551555\n551111555\n555555555\n\nOutput:\n555555555\n555555555\n551111555\n551221555\n222221555\n551111555\n555555555\n\nLet's check differences:\nRow1: no change.\nRow2: no change.\nRow3: \"551111555\" -> \"551111555\" no change.\nRow4: \"551551555\" -> \"551221555\". Let's check: row4: input: 5 5 1 5 5 1 5 5 5 5? Wait, count digits: Actually, row4: \"551551555\" is 9 digits? Let's count: \"551551555\" is 9 digits. But output \"551221555\" is also 9 digits. Let's index: row4: input: digits: 0:5,1:5,2:1,3:5,4:5,5:1,6:5,7:5,8:5. Output: 0:5,1:5,2:1,3:2,4:2,5:1,6:5,7:5,8:5. So changes: index3 changed from 5 to 2, index4 changed from 5 to 2.\nRow5: \"555551555\" -> \"222221555\". Let's check: row5: input: 5 5 5 5 5 1 5 5 5. Output: 2 2 2 2 2 1 5 5 5. So all digits except the middle one changed from 5 to 2? Actually, check: index0:5->2, index1:5->2, index2:5->2, index3:5->2, index4:5->2, index5 remains 1, index6:5 remains 5, index7:5 remains 5, index8:5 remains 5.\nRow6: \"551111555\" -> \"551111555\" no change.\nRow7: \"555555555\" -> \"555555555\" no change.\n\nSo pattern in example 2: It seems that some digits are replaced with 2. But what's the rule? Possibly the rule is: \"Replace all occurrences of the digit that is not the majority in a contiguous region?\" Or maybe it's \"Replace the digit that is adjacent to a different digit?\" Let's check example 3:\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n919119999\n919919999\n919919999\n911119999\n999999999\n999999999\n991111999\n991991999\n991999999\n991111999\n999999999\n\nOutput:\n912119999\n912219999\n912219999\n911119999\n999999999\n999999999\n991111999\n991221999\n991222222\n991111999\n999999999\n\nLet's check differences row by row:\nRow1: \"919119999\" -> \"912119999\". Compare: input: 9 1 9 1 1 9 9 9 9 9? Wait, count digits: Actually, row1: \"919119999\" is 10 digits. Let's index: 0:9,1:1,2:9,3:1,4:1,5:9,6:9,7:9,8:9,9:9. Output: \"912119999\": digits: 0:9,1:1,2:2,3:1,4:1,5:9,6:9,7:9,8:9,9:9. So change: index2 changed from 9 to 2.\nRow2: \"919919999\" -> \"912219999\". Let's index: input: 9,1,9,9,1,9,9,9,9,9. Output: 9,1,2,2,1,9,9,9,9,9. So changes: index2 changed from 9 to 2, index3 changed from 9 to 2.\nRow3: \"919919999\" -> \"912219999\". Same as row2.\nRow4: \"911119999\" -> \"911119999\" no change.\nRow5: \"999999999\" -> \"999999999\" no change.\nRow", "prompt_tokens": 741, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's analyze coordinates. The grid dimensions: It appears each row is 15 characters? Actually, count: \"000006530000000\" is 15 characters. Let me count: Actually, count digits: \"000006530000000\" is 15 characters? Let\u2019s count: digits: \"000006530000000\" equals 15 digits because maybe it's 15 columns? Let me count properly: \"000006530000000\" has a \"6\" at position 7? Let's index columns from 1 to 15. Actually, check: \"000006530000000\", if I count digits: \"0\" appears in positions: 1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:6,8:5,9:3, then zeros afterwards. Actually, let's count: \"000006530000000\" => digits: positions: 1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:6,8:5,9:3, then remaining: 10:0, 11:0, 12:0, 13:0, 14:0, 15:0. So grid dimensions: 16 rows x 15 columns.\nSimilarly, E.g. 2 grid is 13 rows x 12 columns maybe? Let's check: \"000053800000\" is 12 characters, and there are 13 rows? Actually, count: \"000053800000\" is 12 digits, then there are 13 rows? Wait, check e.g. 2: \nRows:\n1: \"000053800000\" (12)\n2: \"000000000000\" (12)\n3: \"000000000000\" (12)\n4: \"000000000000\" (12)\n5: \"500000000000\" (12)\n6: \"000000000008\" (12)\n7: \"000000000000\" (12)\n8: \"000000000000\" (12)\n9: \"300000000000\" (12)\n10:\"000000000000\" (12)\n11:\"000000000000\" (12)\n12:\"000000000000\" (12)\n\nSo grid is 12 rows x 12 columns? Actually, count rows: Actually, there appear to be 13 rows in e.g. 2? Let's re-read: \"E.g. 2 Input:\" then lines. Let me check provided text: \n\"000053800000\" \n\"000000000000\"\n\"000000000000\"\n\"000000000000\"\n\"500000000000\"\n\"000000000008\"\n\"000000000000\"\n\"000000000000\"\n\"300000000000\"\n\"000000000000\"\n\"000000000000\"\n\"000000000000\"\nSo that's 12 rows. Similarly, e.g. 3: count rows: \nRows: \"00046200000\" (10 digits), \n\"00000000000\" (10),\n\"00000000000\" (10),\n\"00000000000\" (10),\n\"40000000002\" (10),\n\"00000000000\" (10),\n\"00000000000\" (10),\n\"00000000000\" (10),\n\"00000000000\" (10),\n\"00000000006\" (10),\n\"00000000000\" (10). \nSo e.g. 3 is 11 rows x 10 columns.\n\nSo the grid dimensions vary.\n\nLet's try to deduce pattern. Common elements: There are digits with zeros. Notice that outputs replicate certain segments along rows and columns.\n\nObservations for Example 1:\nInput:\nRow 1: \"000006530000000\"\nRow 2: \"000000000000000\"\nRow 3: \"000000000000003\"\nRow 4: \"000000000000000\"\nRow 5: \"600000000000000\"\nRow 6: ...\nRow 7: ...\nRow 8: ...\nRow 9: ...\nRow 10: ...\nRow 11: ...\nRow 12: ...\nRow 13: ...\nRow 14: ...\nRow 15: ...\nRow 16: ...\n\nOutput:\nRow 1: \"000006530000000\" same as input row 1.\nRow 2: \"000006530000000\" same as row 1.\nRow 3: \"000006533333333\" row 1 has \"6,5,3\" at columns 7-9, but then row 3 becomes \"333333\" maybe fill something?\nRow 4: \"000006500000000\" row 1 changed: \"6,5,0\" maybe.\nRow 5: \"666666500000000\" row 1's \"6,5,3\" turned to \"6,6,6,6,6,5\"? Actually, row 5: \"666666500000000\" digits: positions: 1:6,2:6,3:6,4:6,5:6,6:6, then 7:5, then zeros.\nRow 6 to row 16: All rows become \"000000500000000\" (first 6 zeros, then 5, then zeros)\n\nSo what's the transformation? It might involve scanning for particular digits in the input and then drawing \"strokes\" along rows and columns? Observing the numbers: In the first example, there are three distinct numbers in input: 6, 5, 3, 0, and there's also 600000... In row 1, there are digits \"6\", \"5\", \"3\". The output replicates row 1 in row 2. Then row 3, the segment \"6,5,3\" becomes \"6,6,6,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3\"? Let's check row 3 in output: \"000006533333333\". That means columns 1-6 are zeros, then column 7:6, column 8:5, column 9:3, and then columns 10-15 are all 3's. Row 4 output: \"000006500000000\" so only \"6\" and \"5\" are kept, and then zeros.\nRow 5 output: \"666666500000000\" means that the first 6 digits become \"6\", then column 7 is \"5\". But row 1 had only one \"6\" at column 7 originally, but now it's expanded to a block of 6 sixes.\nRow 6 onward become \"000000500000000\". So row 1's \"3\" seems to trigger vertical propagation? Let's check positions:\n- In row 1, we see \"6\" at col7, \"5\" at col8, \"3\" at col9.\n- In row 2 output, row 1 is copied entirely.\n- In row 3, at col7, remains 6; col8 remains 5; col9 originally 3 becomes 3, but then columns 10-15 become 3's. So the rightmost digit \"3\" seems to have \"filled\" to the right edge with 3's.\n- In row 4, we see the block of 6 and 5 remain, but then zeros.\n- In row 5, the block of 6's becomes expanded to a full block across the top, turning into \"666666\", then 5 remains at col7, then zeros.\n- Rows 6 to 16 become \"000000500000000\". So the digit 5 seems to propagate downward: row 1 had a 5 at", "prompt_tokens": 886, "completion_tokens": 2048}

{"task_id": "2a5f8217", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus:free", "raw_response": "We are given several examples. Let's re-read all the provided examples and see what transformation rule they have. The examples are derived from ARC tasks. It's likely that the transformation rule is a reordering of digits or shifting them. Let's check carefully.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nRow1: 010000\nRow2: 111000\nRow3: 010000\nRow4: 000080\nRow5: 000888\nRow6: 000080\n\nOutput:\nRow1: 080000\nRow2: 888000\nRow3: 080000\nRow4: 000080\nRow5: 000888\nRow6: 000080\n\nObservations: The digits changed from 0 to 8? Wait, in first row, input: \"010000\", output: \"080000\". Which positions changed? The input has '1' at column index 1 (0-indexed: char1 is 1) but output now is \"08...\", so the first digit changed from 0 to 8? Let's check carefully.\nRow1 Input: 0,1,0,0,0,0. Output: 0,8,0,0,0,0.\nRow2 Input: 1,1,1,0,0,0. Output: 8,8,8,0,0,0.\nRow3 Input: 0,1,0,0,0,0. Output: 0,8,0,0,0,0.\nRow4 Input: 0,0,0,0,8,0. Output: 0,0,0,0,8,0.\nRow5 Input: 0,0,0,0,8,8. Output: 0,0,0,0,8,8.\nRow6 Input: 0,0,0,0,8,0. Output: 0,0,0,0,8,0.\n\nObserving row1 and row2: The transformation seems to be that some digits are replaced by digits that are \"mirror\" maybe? But then row1's first digit remains 0? Actually, let's re-read: It might be that the transformation is \"reflect along vertical axis\"? But if we reflect row1 \"010000\" horizontally, it becomes \"000010\", not \"080000\". So that's not it.\n\nMaybe it's \"rotate\" the grid? Let's check rows. In input, digits: 0 and 1 and 8. In output, they are 0,8, and 8. But then row2: \"111000\" becomes \"888000\". So it seems that the digit 1 becomes 8, and digit 8 remains itself. But then row1 has a 1 becomes 8, row2 has three 1's become three 8's, row3 similar. But then row4: \"000080\" remains \"000080\" no change. Row5: \"000888\" remains unchanged. Row6: same.\n\nSo transformation only changed digits in the \"top\" part (rows 1-3). Why? Possibly because the rule is \"flip the grid vertically\" or \"rotate 180 degrees\" or something? Let's check: if we flip the grid vertically, row1 becomes row6? But then row1 \"010000\" becomes row6 \"000080\"? But output row1 is \"080000\", so no.\n\nMaybe the transformation is \"mirror the left part of the grid over the center vertical axis\"? Let's check: For row1: 0 1 0 0 0 0, if we mirror left half of row1 (0 and 1) to right half, we would get 0 1 1 0 0 0? No.\nAlternatively, maybe it's \"replace every '1' with '8'\"? But row2 has three 1's become 8's, row1 has one 1 become 8. But then row3 same.\nBut then why would row4, row5, row6 remain unchanged? Possibly because they are already 0,8. But row2's 1 becomes 8. But row1 already has 0,1,0,0,0,0 and becomes 0,8,0,0,0,0. So it seems that maybe the transformation is: in the top half of the grid, replace 1 with 8, and in the bottom half, leave unchanged. But then why would row2 (and row3) also have changed? Actually, check row2: originally 111000 becomes 888000. So that fits \"replace 1 with 8\", but row4 remains unchanged, row5 remains unchanged, row6 remains unchanged. But then what about the transformation in Example 2 and Example 3? Let's check Example 2:\n\nInput Example 2:\nRow 1: 000000000\nRow 2: 011100100\nRow 3: 010100110\nRow 4: 000000000\nRow 5: 000000099\nRow 6: 001100009\nRow 7: 000107000\nRow 8: 666007700\nRow 9: 606000000\n\nOutput Example 2:\nRow 1: 000000000\nRow 2: 066600700\nRow 3: 060600770\nRow 4: 000000000\nRow 5: 000000099\nRow 6: 009900009\nRow 7: 000907000\nRow 8: 666007700\nRow 9: 606000000\n\nLet's compare:\nRow2: input \"011100100\" becomes \"066600700\". Which digits changed? The first three digits: originally \"011\", become \"066\". Then next three \"100\" become \"600\"? And then last three \"100\" become \"700\"? Let's check carefully:\nInput row2: \"011100100\"\nBreak it: \"011\" then \"100\" then \"100\".\nOutput row2: \"066600700\" break: \"066\", \"600\", \"700\".\nSo what happened? It seems that the left block \"011\" became \"066\". The middle block \"100\" became \"600\". The right block \"100\" became \"700\". Let's check row3:\nInput row3: \"010100110\"\nBreak into three equal parts? Possibly columns segments? The grid width is 9 columns. So maybe the rule is column-based. Let's check row2 segmentation by columns? The grid width is 9, so maybe split into 3 columns segments of 3 columns each. For row2:\nSegment 1 (cols 0-2): \"011\" becomes \"066\"? But then segment 2 (cols 3-5): \"100\" becomes \"600\"? Segment 3 (cols 6-8): \"100\" becomes \"700\"?\nRow3: \"010100110\" split into segments of 3 columns:\nSegment 1: \"010\" becomes \"060\"? Actually output row3: \"060600770\". Let's break: \"060\", \"600\", \"770\". Input row3: \"010\", \"100\", \"110\". So transformation:\nSegment1: \"010\" -> \"060\". Segment2: \"100\" -> \"600\". Segment3: \"110\" -> \"770\".\n\nRow7: \"000107000\" split into segments of 3:\nSegment1: \"000\" becomes? Output row7: \"000907000\". Let's break output row7: \"000\", \"907\", \"000\". So transformation on segment1: \"000\" -> \"000\" (unchanged). Segment2: \"107\" -> \"907\"? And segment3: \"000\" -> \"000\".\nRow6: \"001100009\" becomes \"009900009\". Break into segments:\nSegment1: \"001\" -> \"009\"? Segment2: \"100\" -> \"900\"? Segment3: \"009\" -> \"009\".\nRow8: \"666007700\" -> \"666007700\" remains unchanged.\nRow9: \"606000000\" remains unchanged.\nRow1 and row4 are all zeros remain zeros.\n\nNow compare with example 1 segmentation. Example 1 grid width is 6 columns, which can be split into 2 segments of 3 columns each. Let's see:\nRow1: \"010000\" split into segments of 3: left: \"010\", right: \"000\".\nOutput row1: \"080000\" split into segments: left: \"080\", right: \"000\". So transformation for left segment: \"010\" -> \"080\". Row2: \"111000\" split into segments: left: \"111\", right: \"000\". Output row2: \"888000\": left: \"888\", right: \"000\". Row3: \"010000\" -> \"080000\": same transformation on left segment.\nRow4: \"000080\" split into segments: left: \"000\", right: \"080\". Output row4: \"000080\": left segment stays \"000\", right segment stays \"080\". Row5: \"000888\" -> \"000888\": left \"000\", right \"888\" unchanged.\nRow6: \"000080\" -> \"000080\": same.\n\nSo transformation seems to be applied to the left segment only in examples 1 and 2? But then look at example 2 row2: left segment transformation: \"011\" became \"066\". Row3: left segment \"010\" became \"060\". Row6: left segment \"001\" became \"009\". In example 2, the transformation seems to apply only to the left-most segment (first", "prompt_tokens": 717, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We need to deduce transformation rule. Let's re-read the examples.\n\nWe have three examples. They are provided as text lines. They are grids with rows separated by newline. The examples are:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n```\n000202000\n002322000\n000020000\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n```\nE.g. 1 Output:\n```\n000303000\n003233000\n000030000\n000000000\n111111111\n000000000\n000020000\n002322000\n000202000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n```\nObserving differences: The input grid is 12 rows x 9 columns. The output grid is also 12 rows x 9 columns. Let's label rows from top to bottom. Let's denote row indices 0 to 11. Let's check differences.\n\nE.g. 1: Compare input and output row by row.\n\nRow0: Input: \"000202000\", Output: \"000303000\". So difference: The substring \"202\" becomes \"303\"? Actually, let's check: \"000202000\" vs \"000303000\". The difference is in the middle digits: \"202\" vs \"303\". Similarly, row1: \"002322000\" vs \"003233000\". The difference: \"2232\" vs \"3233\"? Let's check carefully: row1 input: \"002322000\", output: \"003233000\". The difference: The first two digits \"00\" are same, then \"232\" vs \"233\"? Wait, let's check: \"002322000\" vs \"003233000\". Let's align columns: \n- Column0: 0 vs 0\n- Column1: 0 vs 0\n- Column2: 2 vs 3\n- Column3: 3 vs 2\n- Column4: 2 vs 3\n- Column5: 2 vs 3\n- Column6: 0 vs 0\n- Column7: 0 vs 0\n- Column8: 0 vs 0\n\nSo row1: digits at positions 2,3,4,5 changed from \"2322\" to \"3233\"? Actually, let's re-read: input row1: \"002322000\". Let's index columns: \ncol0: 0, col1: 0, col2: 2, col3: 3, col4: 2, col5: 2, col6: 0, col7: 0, col8: 0.\nOutput row1: \"003233000\": col0: 0, col1: 0, col2: 3, col3: 2, col4: 3, col5: 3, col6: 0, col7: 0, col8: 0.\nSo transformation: It seems like the digits in the middle are being \"rotated\" or \"mirrored\" in some way. Let's check row2: \"000020000\" vs \"000030000\". So row2: input: \"000020000\", output: \"000030000\". So the digit \"2\" becomes \"3\"? But row0: \"202\" becomes \"303\", row2: \"020\" becomes \"030\". So maybe the rule is: add 1 to the digit in the center of a pattern? But then row3: \"000000000\" remains \"000000000\". Row4: \"111111111\" remains \"111111111\". Row5: \"000000000\" remains \"000000000\". Row6: \"000000000\" becomes \"000020000\". Wait, check row6: input row6: \"000000000\", output row6: \"000020000\". So row6: a \"2\" appears in column? Let's check: \"000000000\" vs \"000020000\". The difference: a \"2\" appears at column? Let's count: \"000020000\" means there is a \"2\" at column? Actually, \"000020000\" is 9 digits: index: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:2,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0. So row6: a \"2\" appears at column4. Row7: \"000000000\" becomes \"002322000\". Row8: \"000000000\" becomes \"000202000\". Row9: \"000000000\" remains \"000000000\". Row10: \"000000000\" remains \"000000000\". Row11: \"000000000\" remains \"000000000\".\n\nSo what's pattern? It seems like the transformation is a vertical flip of some pattern? Let's check: The output grid rows 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Compare with input rows: row0 input becomes row0 output, row1 input becomes row1 output, row2 input becomes row2 output, row3 input becomes row3 output, row4 input becomes row4 output, row5 input becomes row5 output, row6 input becomes row8 output? Wait, let's check: row6 input \"000000000\" becomes row8 output \"000202000\"? That doesn't match vertical flip. Let's re-read the provided examples carefully.\n\nWait, I need to re-read the examples. They are given as \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then a block of lines. Then \"E.g. 1 Output:\" then a block of lines. They are not necessarily same grid size? Let's count rows.\n\nE.g. 1 Input: There are 12 lines. E.g. 1 Output: There are 12 lines. So grid size is 12 rows x 9 columns.\n\nLet's label rows 0 to 11 for E.g. 1.\n\nMapping input to output row by row:\nRow0: Input: 000202000, Output: 000303000.\nRow1: Input: 002322000, Output: 003233000.\nRow2: Input: 000020000, Output: 000030000.\nRow3: Input: 000000000, Output: 000000000.\nRow4: Input: 111111111, Output: 111111111.\nRow5: Input: 000000000, Output: 000000000.\nRow6: Input: 000000000, Output: 000020000.\nRow7: Input: 000000000, Output: 002322000.\nRow8: Input: 000000000, Output: 000202000.\nRow9: Input: 000000000, Output: 000000000.\nRow10: Input: 000000000, Output: 000000000.\nRow11: Input: 000000000, Output: 000000000.\n\nObserving pattern: It seems like the transformation is a vertical flip of the top part of the grid? Let's check: The top part of the grid (rows 0-2) are modified: row0: \"202\" becomes \"303\", row1: \"2322\" becomes \"3233\", row2: \"020\" becomes \"030\". And then rows 6,7,8: they become \"020\", \"2322\", \"202\" respectively? Let's check row6 output: \"000020000\" which is \"020\" in the middle, row7 output: \"002322000\" which is \"2322\" in the middle, row8 output: \"000202000\" which is \"202\" in the middle. And rows 0-2 input become rows 0-2 output? Wait, let's check: row0 input \"202\" becomes row0 output \"303\". But row8 output \"202\" is same as row0 input \"202\". Similarly, row1 input \"2322\" becomes row1 output \"3233\", but row7 output \"2322\" is same as row1 input \"2322\". And row2 input \"020\" becomes row2 output \"030\", but row6 output \"020\" is same as row2 input \"020\". So it appears that the transformation is a vertical flip of the top three rows with some digit increment? Let's check: row0 input \"202\" becomes row0 output \"303\". But row8 output is \"202\", which is the original row0 input. So maybe the rule is: The grid is split vertically into two parts: the top part (rows 0-2) and the bottom part (rows 6-8) are swapped, but with some modification on the top part? Let's check: row0 input \"202\" becomes row0 output \"303\", but row8 output is \"202\". row1 input \"2322\" becomes row1 output \"3233\", but row7 output is \"2322\". row2 input \"020\" becomes row2 output \"030\", but row6 output is \"020\". And then rows 3-5 remain unchanged. And row4 remains unchanged. And rows 9-11 remain unchanged.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: The grid is rotated 180 degrees? Let's check: If we rotate the entire grid 180 degrees, then row0 becomes row11, row1 becomes row10, etc. But here, row0 input becomes row0 output, not row11. So not that.\n\nMaybe the rule is: The grid is reflected horizontally? Let's check: Reflect", "prompt_tokens": 865, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The output grid is created by overlapping the extracted patterns and taking the union of non-zero values.\n5.

{"task_id": "2c0b0aff", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus:free", "raw_response": "We are given examples of ARC puzzles, with input grids and output grids. We have four examples and a test input. The transformation rule is hidden. We need to determine the transformation rule from the provided examples. Let's re-read the instructions carefully. The task is: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" We are provided with several pairs of example input grids and corresponding output grids.\n\nWe have 4 examples labeled E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, E.g. 4. They are provided as the grid lines. Then there is a test input grid with 22 lines? Wait, how many lines? Let's count the provided test input lines. I'll check carefully:\n\nTest Input:\nLine 1: \"00000000000000000000000\" (20 characters?) Wait, count digits? Actually, each grid is a rectangular grid with rows. Let's check: The e.g. 1 input has 22 lines. Each line appears to be 20 characters long? Actually, check e.g. 1 input: There are 22 lines. But check first e.g. 1 input: \"00000000000000000000000\" (20 zeros) then next is \"00000000000000000000000\" another 20 zeros etc. Then the next lines have digits. So each grid is of dimension 22 rows x 20 columns. But then e.g. 1 output: The output grid, they are provided as lines with length 8? Let's check: E.g. 1 output: \n\"83888883\" (8 digits?) Actually, count: \"83888883\" is 8 characters, next \"33388388\" is 8, so output grid is 7 rows x 8 columns? But e.g. 1 output: Let's count lines:\nE.g. 1 output lines:\n1: \"83888883\"\n2: \"33388388\"\n3: \"83883338\"\n4: \"88888388\"\n5: \"83888838\"\n6: \"33388333\"\n7: \"83888838\"\nSo e.g. 1 output is 7 rows x 8 columns, which is half the width of the input? Not exactly half maybe? 20 columns input becomes 8 columns output, and 22 rows input becomes 7 rows output.\nE.g. 2 input: 26 rows? Let's count: Actually, there are 26 lines in e.g. 2 input? Actually, I'll count: The first two lines are \"000000000000000000000000\" repeated, then there is another two lines of zeros. There are 26 lines total? Let's count: Actually, provided E.g. 2 input lines: I see \"000000000000000000000000\" repeated twice maybe? Let's re-read: \nE.g. 2 input: \nLine 1: \"000000000000000000000000\" (24 zeros?) Actually count: \"000000000000000000000000\" is 24 characters? Let's check: The pattern is ambiguous. But then E.g. 2 output: \nLines:\n1: \"883888838\"\n2: \"833388333\"\n3: \"883888838\"\n4: \"388838888\"\n5: \"838888383\"\n6: \"333883338\"\n7: \"838888388\"\n8: \"888838888\"\nSo e.g. 2 output is 8 rows x 9 columns? Wait, count characters in \"883888838\": count digits: There are 9 digits? Let's check: \"883888838\" digits: 8,8,3,8,8,8,8,3,8. Yes 9 digits. \nE.g. 3 output: \n\"88388388\" (8 digits), next \"83338838\" (8 digits), then \"88388333\" (8 digits), \"88888838\" (8 digits), \"38883883\" (8 digits), \"88833388\" (8 digits), \"83883888\" (8 digits), \"88888833\" (8 digits). So e.g. 3 output is 8x8.\nE.g. 4 output: \n\"38888888888\" (11 digits), \"88838838888\" (11 digits), \"88333888388\" (11 digits), \"88838883338\" (11 digits), \"83888888388\" (11 digits), \"33388388888\" (11 digits), \"83883338838\" (11 digits), \"88888388888\" (11 digits). So e.g. 4 output is 8 rows x 11 columns.\n\nObserving dimensions relative to inputs: Let's check e.g. 1: input is 22 rows x ? Actually, count columns in e.g. 1 input: \"00000000000000000000000\" has length? Let's count: The given line \"00000000000000000000000\" - I count: maybe 22 zeros? Let's count: It is \"00000000000000000000000\". Count digits in e.g. 1 first line: Possibly 22 digits. Let me count manually: \"00000000000000000000000\" maybe count groups: \"0000000000\" (10) then \"0000000000\" (20) then \"000000\" (6) totals 26? That doesn't match. Let's count carefully: Actually, I'll count the characters: \nLine: \"00000000000000000000000\"\nI can try grouping: maybe I'll count digits: \nI see \"0000000000\" is 10, then \"0000000000\" is 20, then \"000000\" is 6 digits. But they said 22 rows? The problem statement says examples are provided. But it's not obvious the dimension mapping.\n\nWait, I see in e.g. 1 input, the first two lines are all zeros. They are 20 digits? Let's count: \"00000000000000000000000\" - if I count: There are 20 zeros? Actually, I'll count: \"00000000000000000000000\" -> It might be 20 digits because e.g. 1 output is 8 columns, and maybe it's half the input columns? Wait, 20/2 = 10, but output has 8 columns. 22/2 = 11, but output has 7 rows. \nMaybe there is a transformation rule like \"take every other row and every other column\" but then the dimensions don't match exactly.\n\nLet's check e.g. 1: Input dimension: It might be 22 rows x 20 columns? And output is 7 rows x 8 columns? 22/ ? 22 to 7, 20 to 8. That suggests maybe the output is a \"central submatrix\" extracted from the input? For e.g. 1, if input is 22 rows x 20 columns, then 22 - 7 = 15 rows are cut off? That doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe it's a common pattern: The input grids are typically 22 rows by 20 columns? And the outputs are 7 rows by 8 columns in e.g. 1, 8 rows by 9 columns in e.g. 2, 8 rows by 8 columns in e.g. 3, 8 rows by 11 columns in e.g. 4. The differences: e.g. 1 output: 7 rows, e.g. 2 output: 8 rows, e.g. 3 output: 8 rows, e.g. 4 output: 8 rows. And columns: e.g. 1: 8 columns, e.g. 2: 9 columns, e.g. 3: 8 columns, e.g. 4: 11 columns.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is not a simple subsampling. They might be performing a transformation that extracts the \"core\" of the input, or maybe a \"diagonal reflection\" or \"rotation\" transformation.\n\nI recall some common ARC puzzles: They sometimes involve \"cropping\" the zeros from the boundary, or \"highlighting\" a pattern shape. Let me try to see patterns in each example.\n\nTake E.g. 1:\nInput grid (e.g. 1 input) - I'll denote coordinates row, col. There are 22 rows, columns count maybe 20. The output grid is 7x8. Possibly the output is extracted from the input's \"inner\" region. Check structure: The output digits: \"83888883\", etc. They are composed of digits 8 and 3 and sometimes 0? Actually, output digits: They are only 8, 3, and maybe 0? In e.g. 1 output, digits are: row1: 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3, row2: 3 3 3 8 8 8 3 8, row3: 8 3 8 8 3 3 3 8, row4: 8 8 8 8 8 3 8 8, row5: 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8, row6: 3 3 3 8 8 8 3 3, row7: 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8.\n\nI", "prompt_tokens": 1580, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We are given several example input-output pairs and one test input grid. We need to deduce transformation rule. Let's re-read examples in detail.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nRow0: \"0003000000\" (10 columns, 12 rows probably, check row count: Actually provided: \"0003000000\", \"0013100000\", \"0445000000\", \"0001000000\", \"0007200000\", \"0000000000\", \"0000000000\", \"0000005000\", \"0000000000\", \"0000000000\", \"0000000000\", \"0000000000\". Actually count rows: They are 12 rows. Output:\nRow0: \"0003000000\"\nRow1: \"0013100000\"\nRow2: \"0445000000\"\nRow3: \"0001000000\"\nRow4: \"0007200000\"\nRow5: \"0000003000\"\nRow6: \"0000013100\"\nRow7: \"0000440000\"\nRow8: \"0000001000\"\nRow9: \"0000007200\"\nRow10: \"0000000000\"\nRow11: \"0000000000\"\n\nObservations: In example 1, the input grid:\n- Row indices: I'll label row numbers 0 to 11. I see some digits in rows.\nLooking at input:\nRow0: \"0003000000\" has \"300\" in middle columns? Actually \"0003000000\" means column indices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:3,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0.\nRow1: \"0013100000\": columns: maybe has digits \"01310\"? Actually check: \"0013100000\" -> digits: 0,0,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow2: \"0445000000\": digits: 0,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow3: \"0001000000\": digits: 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow4: \"0007200000\": digits: 0,0,0,7,2,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow5: \"0000000000\": all zeros.\nRow6: \"0000005000\": digits: 0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0.\nRow7: \"0000000000\": all zeros.\nRow8: \"0000000000\": all zeros.\nRow9: \"0000000000\": all zeros.\nRow10: \"0000000000\": all zeros.\nRow11: \"0000000000\": all zeros.\n\nOutput:\nRow0: same as input row0.\nRow1: same as input row1.\nRow2: same as input row2.\nRow3: same as input row3.\nRow4: same as input row4.\nRow5: \"0000003000\": digits: row index 5: previously input row5 was all zeros, but now \"300\" appears.\nRow6: \"0000013100\": digits: row index 6: previously input row6: \"0000005000\", now row6 changed to \"0000013100\".\nRow7: \"0000440000\": row index 7: previously input row7 all zeros, now \"044\" appears.\nRow8: \"0000001000\": row index 8: previously input row8 all zeros, now \"100\" appears.\nRow9: \"0000007200\": row index 9: previously row9 all zeros becomes \"720\".\nRow10: \"0000000000\": remains zeros.\nRow11: \"0000000000\": remains zeros.\n\nObservations: The digits seem to have moved from the top half to the bottom half of the grid. Let's check coordinates:\n\nMapping: In the input grid, rows with non-zero digits are rows 0,1,2,3,4,6. In the output, these non-zero digits appear in rows 0-4? Actually no: row0: unchanged, row1: unchanged, row2: unchanged, row3: unchanged, row4: unchanged, then row5: gets \"300\", row6: gets \"01310\"? Wait, row6 in output is \"0000013100\" which is \"01310\" but not exactly same as row1? Let's check: row0-4 are same as input rows 0-4. Then row5 output \"300\": which originally came from row0's \"300\"? Actually input row0 \"0003000000\" and output row5 \"0000003000\" are similar digits but shifted? Wait, let's check differences:\n\nMapping possibility: The output grid seems to be a vertical reflection and translation of input non-zero digits. Possibly rule: \"Reflect grid vertically and then shift non-zero digits to bottom\" or \"copy pattern from top half to bottom half\".\n\nLet's look carefully:\nInput row0: \"0003000000\" becomes unchanged in output row0. So row0 remains row0.\nInput row1: \"0013100000\" remains row1.\nInput row2: \"0445000000\" remains row2.\nInput row3: \"0001000000\" remains row3.\nInput row4: \"0007200000\" remains row4.\nThen input row5, originally all zeros, now becomes \"0000003000\". That is \"300\" placed in row5. Where did that come from? Possibly from row0? Because row0 had \"300\". But output row0 is same as input row0. But then row5 gets \"300\" from row? Actually let's check: \"300\" appears in row0: \"0003000000\" digits at columns 3-5? Wait, \"300\" means digit 3 then 0 then 0. But row0 is \"0003000000\" which is \"3\" in column 3 and then columns 4 and 5 are zeros. But \"300\" as a sequence: first digit is 3 then 0,0. But in row0, the digits are \"0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0\". So if we take \"300\", that's a group of three digits. But wait, row5 output is \"0000003000\". These are digits at positions 6-8? Actually \"300\" appears at columns 6-8 in row5? Let's check: row5 output \"0000003000\": digits: index0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:3,7:0,8:0,9:0. So it's \"300\" starting at column index 6? But in row0 input, \"300\" is at column index 3. So maybe the rule is that the digits are moved to a symmetrical position horizontally relative to center? Also look at row6 output \"0000013100\": digits: index0-5: 0, then index6:1, index7:3, index8:1, index9:0. Compare input row1 \"0013100000\": digits: index0:0,1:0,2:1,3:3,4:1,5:0, then zeros. So row1 digits \"01310\" appear in output row6 starting at column 6. Similarly, row7 output \"0000440000\": compare input row2 \"0445000000\": digits: \"0445\", but output row7 is \"044\" not \"0445\". Wait, output row7 \"0000440000\": digits at columns 4-6: \"044\"? But input row2 had \"0445\" but then output row7 is missing the last digit \"5\"? Let's re-check row2 input: \"0445000000\" means digits: 0,4,4,5,0,0,0,0,0,0. But output row7: \"0000440000\": digits: 0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0. So it seems row2 lost the last digit \"5\"? Actually check: \"044\" appears in row7 output. Which part of row2? It might be the first three digits of row2? But then row8 output \"0000001000\": compare to input row3 \"0001000000\": first nonzero \"1\" digit, but then output row8 is \"100\" instead of \"100\"? Wait: row3 input \"0001000000\": digits: 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0. Output row8 \"0000001000\": digits: positions: 6 is 1, then 7:0,8:0, which is \"100\" but shifted? Not sure.\n\nRow9 output \"0000007200\": compare with input row4 \"0007200000\": digits: \"7\", \"2\" then zeros, output row9 becomes \"720\" (shifted similarly).\n\nLet's re-read the examples with potential pattern: Possibly the transformation takes the top block of non-zero rows and then \"mirrors\" them vertically to the bottom half, but with horizontal shift to right.\n\nObserving row mapping from input to output:\n- Output rows 0-", "prompt_tokens": 806, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's count each row: row 1: \"000000000\" is 9 digits, row 2: \"000000000\" is 9 digits, row 3: \"000400000\" is 9 digits, row 4: \"004440000\" is 9 digits, row 5: \"003400000\" is 9 digits, row 6: \"004440000\" is 9 digits, row 7: \"000000000\" is 9 digits, row 8: \"000000000\" is 9 digits. Wait, count output rows: There are 8 rows? Let's double-check: Provided \"E.g. 1 Output:\" then:\nLine: \"000000000\"\nLine: \"000000000\"\nLine: \"000400000\"\nLine: \"004440000\"\nLine: \"003400000\"\nLine: \"004440000\"\nLine: \"000000000\"\nLine: \"000000000\"\nSo that's 8 rows. But then what? The provided output grid earlier in the text: \"000000000\" on a new line, then \"000000000\", then \"000400000\", etc. So output grid is 8 rows x 9 columns. \n\nNow, we need to derive the transformation rule.\n\nObserving structure: The input grid has many 8's and 0's. In the output grid, we see only 0's and 4's and 3's? Actually, output grid digits: row1: all 0's. row2: all 0's. row3: \"000400000\". row4: \"004440000\". row5: \"003400000\". row6: \"004440000\". row7: \"000000000\". row8: \"000000000\". They look like they've extracted some pattern. Possibly they are \"borders\" or \"center\" extraction of a particular subgrid from the input.\n\nWhere do digits 4, 3 appear in input? Let's look at input grid: rows 8 to 10 or so: row 8: \"88003000000888888888888\" => there's a \"0030\" substring in the middle (starting at column index maybe 2?) row 9: \"88000000000888888888888\" has 000000000008888...\nRow 10: \"88000000000888800000088\" has 000000000008888000000 in the middle.\n\nWait, let me check row indices in input relative to output rows. The output grid is 8 rows x 9 columns. Input grid is 19 rows x 28 columns. Possibly the transformation extracts a central 8x9 region from a larger grid, but the pattern is not trivial.\n\nLet's search for digits other than 8 and 0. In input, aside from 8 and 0, in row 8 we see \"03\" appears: row 8 \"88003000000888888888888\". In row 12: \"88888888888888800400088\" has \"004000\", row 13 \"88888888888888804440088\" has \"044400\", row 14 \"88888888888888803400088\" has \"034000\", row 15 \"88888888888888804440088\" again \"044400\", row 10 \"88000000000888800000088\" has \"000000000008888000000\". So, the digits 3, 4 appear in the central region of the input. The output grid digits 4 and 3 appear in rows 3,4,5,6 of output. They are arranged in a pattern: row3: \"000400000\", row4: \"004440000\", row5: \"003400000\", row6: \"004440000\". This pattern is reminiscent of a plus shape or a \"ring\" pattern. Let's see: row3: digit 4 at column 4 (if 1-indexed, then 4th digit is 4). Row4: digits: leading 00, then 444 then 000? Actually, row4: \"004440000\" means digit 4 appears in columns 3,4,5 maybe? Then row5: \"003400000\" means digit 3 at column 3 and digit 4 at column 4? Wait, check: \"003400000\": if indexing columns from 1, then positions: col1:0, col2:0, col3:3, col4:4, col5:0, col6:0, col7:0, col8:0, col9:0. Row6: \"004440000\" again. So pattern might be symmetric vertically: row3 and row6 are similar, row4 and row5 are inverses? They are not exactly mirror images because row4 has four 4's and row5 has 3 and 4.\n\nMaybe we need to compare with Example 2 and 3.\n\nExample 2:\nInput grid:\n```\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888800000888888\n8888888888800020888888\n8888888888800000888888\n8888888888800000888888\n8888888888800000888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8800000088888888888888\n8800440088888888888888\n8804424088888888888888\n8800440088888888888888\n8888888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888888", "prompt_tokens": 1158, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We are provided with multiple examples labeled E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, E.g. 4, and E.g. 5. The final test input grid is:\n\nTest Input:\n0000\n0040\n0000\n4000\n\nWe need to deduce transformation rule. Let's analyze the examples.\n\nI see that the examples are pairs of input and output grids. Let me check them.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n00\n07\nOutput:\n202020\n070707\n202020\n070707\n202020\n070707\n\nObservations: The input is a 2x2 grid. The output is 6 rows x 2 columns? Wait, check: Actually E.g. 1 input lines: \"00\" then \"07\". So grid is 2 rows, 2 columns:\nRow0: [0,0]\nRow1: [0,7].\nThe output lines are \"202020\", \"070707\", \"202020\", \"070707\", \"202020\", \"070707\". Wait, how many columns? They are 6 digits if read as \"202020\"? Actually each line has 6 digits? That is not a grid of 2 columns; it's 6 columns and 6 rows perhaps? Let's re-read: \"E.g. 1 Output:\n202020\n070707\n202020\n070707\n202020\n070707\"\n\nCount digits: \"202020\" has 6 digits. So output grid is 6 rows x 6 columns? Wait, but then what is the transformation? Let's re-read the prompt: \" ARC problems\" probably involve transforming a grid by repeating pattern or scaling. There are several similar problems in ARC challenge.\n\nE.g. 2: \nInput:\n000\n006\n600\nThis is a 3x3 grid.\nOutput:\n020020020\n006006006\n600600600\n020020020\n006006006\n600600600\n020020020\n006006006\n600600600\nSo output is 9 rows x 9 columns.\n\nSo pattern: The transformation rule in each example seems to be \"scaling\" the grid by factor 3? But wait, 2x2 input becomes 6x6 output? 2x2 grid scaled by factor 3 would be 6x6, yes. 3x3 grid scaled by factor 3 would be 9x9. That fits.\n\nCheck example 3:\nInput is 5 rows x 5 grid.\nOutput is 15 rows x 15 columns? Let's count: \"200002000020000\" is 15 digits, and there are 15 rows.\nYes.\n\nExample 4:\nInput grid: 4 rows x 4 grid.\nOutput grid: 12 rows x 12 columns.\nExample 5:\nInput grid: 4 rows x 4 grid.\nOutput grid: 12 rows x 12 columns.\n\nSo, it appears the transformation is \"tile replication\", but not exactly replication. Let's check pattern of digits.\n\nWe see that the transformation always multiplies grid dimensions by 3. And then maybe transforms each cell's value with some addition? Let's check E.g. 1: Original: row0: 0, 0; row1: 0, 7.\nOutput: row0: 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0; row1: 0,7,0,7,0,7; row2: 2,0,2,0,2,0; row3: 0,7,0,7,0,7; row4: 2,0,2,0,2,0; row5: 0,7,0,7,0,7.\nSo it seems the original grid is being repeated 3 times in each dimension, but with some modifications: The digits might be changed in a pattern. Let's look at differences: Input cell (0,0)=0 becomes output (0,0) =? Actually, let's try to see pattern: For a cell with value 0 in input, in output, it becomes alternating 2 and 0? Wait check: Row0, col0 in output is 2, row0, col1 is 0, row0, col2 is 2, row0, col3 is 0, row0, col4 is 2, row0, col5 is 0. So the pattern in the row: 2,0,2,0,2,0. But input row0 was 0,0. So how do we get 2 from 0? And then the row that originally was 7 (row1, col1 equals 7) becomes 7 in the output row. Check row1: \"070707\" so in row1, col0 is 0, col1 is 7, col2 is 0, col3 is 7, col4 is 0, col5 is 7.\n\nSo pattern: It seems the transformation takes the original grid, replicates it with a 3x3 block structure, but then each block is not a direct copy. Instead, maybe the rule is: The new grid is divided into 9 sub-blocks, each of size (original rows/?) Actually, wait, consider: For each cell in the original grid, in the output, the corresponding region is a 3x3 block, but each block's pattern seems to be a transformation of the original cell value. Let's check: In E.g. 1, original grid (top-left cell is 0) becomes in its block: In the 3x3 block corresponding to that cell, the pattern is: top-left block: maybe 2,0,2 in the top row, then 0,?,? etc. Let's check the output structure: The output is a 6x6 grid, which is 3 times 2 rows and 3 times 2 columns. But 3 times 2 equals 6, but then within each 2x2 block, the pattern is not simply replication. Let's re-read the outputs: They are printed as sequences of digits, but we need to group them properly.\n\nFor E.g. 1, the input grid is 2 rows x 2 columns:\nRow0, col0 = 0, row0, col1 = 0.\nRow1, col0 = 0, row1, col1 = 7.\nNow, the output is 6 rows x 6 columns. How is it divided? Possibly into 3x3 grid of 2x2 blocks. Because 6 = 3*2, and 6 = 3*2.\nLet's try: Partition the output grid into blocks of size 2 (the same as input). The blocks coordinates: block (i, j) for i in {0,1,2} and j in {0,1,2}. So each block is 2 rows by 2 columns. Now examine block (0,0) which corresponds to input cell (0,0) which is 0. Block (0,0) in output: rows 0-1, columns 0-1, should be: row0: digits at positions 0 and 1 of output row? But wait, the output row \"202020\": if we group every 2 digits: (2,0), (2,0), (2,0). But that doesn't match a 2x2 block. Let's try another grouping: since output is 6x6 and input is 2x2, factor is 3. So each cell of input becomes a 3x3 block in output? But 3*2=6, so if each input cell's value is replaced by a 3x3 block, then the output grid would be 6x6. But then each block would be 3 columns wide, not 2. Wait, let's recalc scaling factor: if original grid is 2x2, output is 6x6, then factor is 3. But then each cell becomes a 3x3 block. But 2x3=6? Wait, 2*3=6, yes. So then each original cell is replaced by a 3x3 subgrid. But then how many subgrids? For a 2x2 grid, we'd have 2*3 = 6 rows and 2*3 = 6 columns, which is consistent. So each input cell is replaced by a 3x3 pattern. Let's check: For input cell (0,0)=0, what is the 3x3 block in the output? The output's top-left 3x3 block should correspond to that cell. But the output's first row is \"202020\", first 3 digits: \"202\". So that block is:\nRow0: 2,0,2\nRow1: ? We need to extract rows carefully. But output grid is 6x6. If each cell expands to 3 rows and 3 columns, then the grid is partitioned into blocks of size 3. But 6 is not divisible by 3? It is divisible by 3 (6/3=2). So then there are 2 blocks vertically and 2 blocks horizontally, each block is 3x3. So indeed, the transformation is: given an n x n grid, produce a (3n) x (3n) grid, where each cell of the input becomes a 3x3 block in the output. And the pattern in a 3x3 block is determined by the input cell's", "prompt_tokens": 774, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The output grids are \"444\" rows for example 1, \"333\" rows for example 2, \"888\" rows for example 3. Actually, let's check the provided examples: The examples input are 20x20 grids?

Actually, check: The outputs are \"444\" in each row, but the question says output as JSON list of lists (like [[1,0]]). But the expected output is JSON list of lists, but we need to produce final test grid in that format.\n\nWe are given three examples transformation that output grids (3 rows each) that are uniform. The transformation rule: Perhaps reading the examples, input grid is 20x20, output grid is 3x3? Possibly the rule is \"Find the center of the grid and choose a pattern from it\"? Let's try to reason.\n\nThe examples: There are three examples, each with input grid 20 rows? Let's count rows: each example input seems to have 20 rows? Actually, count: Example 1: It shows 20 lines? Let's count: The first example input: It has 20 lines (I see 20 rows). And the output is \"444\", repeated three times. So output is 3x3 grid? But wait, the output example is \"444\" (3 characters) repeated over 3 rows, so a 3x3 grid that is all \"444\" (i.e. every cell equals 4)? But then example 2: input grid is similarly 20 rows (I think so, but actually check: Example 2: It might be also 20 rows? Actually count: \"88888010118111000001\" etc. They are 20 lines? Let's check: Actually, we've got 20 lines in example 2? Let's count: It starts with \"88888010118111000001\", next line, etc. There are 20 lines. The output is \"333\" repeated on 3 rows, so output grid is 3x3 grid filled with 3.\n\nExample 3: Input grid: It might be 20 rows, and output is \"888\" repeated on 3 rows, so output grid is 3x3 grid filled with 8.\n\nWait, careful: The problem statement: \"The user will provide several pairs of example input grids and their corresponding output grids. They represent a hidden transformation rule.\" And then a final test input grid is provided. And the output final test grid is required. The transformation rule is to take the input grid, which is 20x20? But then the output is a 3x3 grid? Let's re-read: \"E.g. 1 Input: ...\" then \"E.g. 1 Output: 444, 444, 444\". So example 1: the grid is 20 characters wide and 20 lines? But output is 3 rows of 3 digits each? Possibly the rule is: \"Find the numbers that occur at specific positions in the input grid, then fill a 3x3 output grid by substitution of the digit that appears at specific positions.\" Perhaps the rule is: \"Replace the border with a constant digit?\" But then why does each output row become all the same digit? Wait, the output grid of example 1 is:\n\nRow1: \"444\"\nRow2: \"444\"\nRow3: \"444\"\n\nSo output is a uniform grid of a single digit repeated: \"4\" for example 1, \"3\" for example 2, and \"8\" for example 3.\n\nMaybe the rule is like: \"Take the center 3x3 subgrid of the input grid\" but the example outputs are uniform. Let's look at the input of example 1. The digits in the input are mostly 6,7,0, etc. But the output is 444. That might be computed by taking maybe the four corners? Alternatively, maybe the rule is to compute the sum of all digits in some region, then modulo something to get a digit? But then output is uniform across the grid, so the same digit in every cell. So the transformation rule might be: \"Find the mode (most frequent digit) in the input grid\" and then fill the entire output grid with that digit repeated. But check example 2: The output is \"333\". The most frequent digit in example 2 input? Let's check: The grid in example 2: It has many digits, but the output digit is 3, not 8 or 4. Wait, example 3: The output is \"888\". So the outputs are 4,3,8 respectively. They are not the same as the most frequent digit? Let's check example 1: The digits in example 1: There are many 6, many 7, some 0, some 4. The output digit is 4, which is not obviously the most frequent. Let's count approximate frequencies: In example 1, digit '6' appears a lot maybe. Wait, let's analyze example 1. I'll rewrite the grid rows with indices maybe. The grid is 20 rows x 20 columns. The output is a 3x3 grid, but each cell is the same digit \"4\". So maybe the rule is: \"Take the four corners of the input grid and average them or something\"? But then the digit would be computed from corners? Alternatively, maybe the rule is \"Take the central square of the input grid (maybe a 3x3 subgrid) and then replace each number with the digit that appears most in that subgrid\" but then that subgrid should be uniform? Let's check: The output is fully uniform; maybe the transformation rule is: \"Take the input grid, then extract the 3x3 subgrid in the center, then compute the digit that is the majority or something from that subgrid, then fill the entire output grid with that digit.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: \"Replace every digit with the digit that is the complement to 9.\" But then example 1: Complement of 6 is 3, complement of 7 is 2, complement of 0 is 9, etc. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: \"Consider the input grid as a fractal pattern, and the output grid is the 'core' that remains after repeatedly removing the border.\" There is an ARC challenge called \"Find the center\" maybe. There is a known ARC challenge: \"Find the center of a 2D pattern.\" Possibly the rule is: \"Erase the outer border of the input, leaving a smaller grid, then repeat until grid size is 3x3.\" I've seen a similar ARC challenge: \"Find the center\" sometimes. Let's check: The input grid in example 1 is 20x20, output is 3x3. If you remove all border layers repeatedly, you'll eventually get a 3x3 grid if the input grid is symmetric? But then output grid is uniform \"444\". Let me check: How many layers to remove? If you remove a border from a 20x20, you get an 18x18 grid. Remove one more border, you get a 16x16. That doesn't get you to 3x3. But maybe you remove until the grid is exactly 3x3? Wait, but 20 is not reducible to 3 by repeatedly removing borders (removing 2 rows each time). Possibly the rule is: \"Find the center 3x3 of the input grid.\"\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Take the 3x3 subgrid that is in the center of the input grid. Then replace each digit with a transformation: maybe take the sum of that 3x3 subgrid's digits mod something, or maybe the rule is: \"Each cell in the output grid is the count of how many times a particular digit appears in the corresponding cell in the input grid?\" Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to look at the four corners of the input grid (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) and then fill the output grid with a digit that is computed by some arithmetic on these corner digits. For example, in example 1, the corners: top-left is '6' (first char of first row), top-right is '6' (last char of first row), bottom-left is '6' (first char of last row), bottom-right is '0'? Actually, let's check: Example 1 first row: \"66677700600600660066\". The first char: '6', last char: '6'. Last row: \"00776006766060607700\". The first char: '0', last char: '0'. So corners are 6,6,0,0. The average maybe? The average of", "prompt_tokens": 1079, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Looking row by row.\n\nFor E.g. 1, row wise:\nRow1: input: 5500000500, output: 5500111500.\nObserving differences: digits positions: There is probably a transformation applied to some local pattern? Let's compare columns:\nPositions:\nIndex: 0 is '5' remains '5'? In row1, index0: '5' input vs output '5'? \nLet's check row1: \"5500000500\" vs \"5500111500\". Differences:\n- At index 7: input digit '0' vs output '1'? \n- At index 8: input digit '5' vs output '1'? \n- At index 9: input digit '0' vs output '0'? No change? Let's check carefully row1. Actually, let's align indices:\nRow1: digits: positions: 0:5, 1:5, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:5, 8:0, 9:0? Wait recalc row1 input: \"5500000500\". Actually, I must check: The string \"5500000500\" if we break it into digits: \n- digit1: 5, digit2: 5, digit3: 0, digit4: 0, digit5: 0, digit6: 0, digit7: 0, digit8: 5, digit9: 0, digit10:0? Wait, check: \"5500000500\"\nMaybe it's 10 characters. Let's index from 0 to 9\n0:5, 1:5, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:0? Wait, I'll count carefully:\n\"5500000500\"\nCounting characters: \n- first char: '5'\n- second char: '5'\n- third char: '0'\n- fourth char: '0'\n- fifth char: '0'\n- sixth char: '0'\n- seventh char: '0'\n- eighth char: '0'? But that would be \"5500000\"? Let's recount: \"5500000500\" has length = 11? Actually, check: \"5500000500\" seems like 11 digits? But provided examples: In E.g. 2, input lines are \"0500500000\" which is 11 digits. Wait, let's check. Each example appears to have 10 lines? But each line length might be 10 digits or 11 digits? Let's count characters: \"5500000500\" count: characters: \n- \"55\" (2), \"0000\" (4 more, 6), \"005\" (3, 9), \"00\" (2, total 11). Yes, so every line is 11 digits. Possibly they are 11 columns? Let's check row2: \"0055000055\" count: 2 zeros, then 55, then 000, then 55? Actually, counting: 0,0,5,5,0,0,0,5,5. That's 9 digits? Wait, let's count properly each line: They are strings, but I need to count characters. Let's count E.g. 1 Input first row: \"5500000500\". Count manually: characters: '5' (1), '5' (2), '0' (3), '0' (4), '0' (5), '0' (6), '0' (7), '0' (8), '5' (9), '0' (10), '0' (11). So indeed, there are 11 digits. Row2: \"0055000055\": counting: '0'(1), '0'(2), '5'(3), '5'(4), '0'(5), '0'(6), '0'(7), '5'(8), '5'(9)?? Actually, let's count: \"0055000055\": It might be 10 digits? Let's check: \"0055000055\" if I count: \ncharacters: 0,0,5,5,0,0,0,5,5. That's 9 digits. But then row3 \"5505000050\": count: 5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0 = 10 digits. So there might be inconsistency in number of digits per row? Perhaps the grid is not rectangular? Wait, let me re-read task description: \"Input grids\" are likely represented as strings separated by newlines. They might be 10 rows of 10 digits. But our example: \"5500000500\" seems to have 10 digits if we consider them in pairs? Let's check: \"55\" then \"0000\" then \"50\" then \"00\"? That would be segmentation: \"55\" then \"0000\" then \"50\" then \"00\" gives 2+4+2+2 = 10. But then counting \"5500000500\" if we group digits in pairs: \"55\", \"00\", \"00\", \"50\", \"00\" is 5 pairs = 10 digits. But then row2: \"0055000055\" group: \"00\", \"55\", \"00\", \"00\", \"55\" is also 10 digits. So the length is 10 digits, not 11. Let's count carefully \"5500000500\": if I group in pairs: \"55\", \"00\", \"00\", \"50\", \"00\" that gives 2+2+2+2+2 = 10. So the correct segmentation is 10 digits: the string \"5500000500\" when split in pairs: \"55\" (digits 0-1), \"00\" (digits 2-3), \"00\" (digits 4-5), \"50\" (digits 6-7), \"00\" (digits 8-9). But then if I count manually, wait, \"5500000500\" has 10 characters? Let's count: \n- '5' (index0)\n- '5' (index1)\n- '0' (index2)\n- '0' (index3)\n- '0' (index4)\n- '0' (index5)\n- '0' (index6)\n- '0' (index7)\n- '5' (index8)\n- '0' (index9)\nThat sums to 10 digits. So each row is 10 digits.\n\nNow E.g. 1 row1: \"5500000500\" vs output: \"5500111500\". Let's label columns indices 0-9:\nInput row1: index0:5, index1:5, index2:0, index3:0, index4:0, index5:0, index6:0, index7:0, index8:5, index9:0.\nOutput row1: \"5500111500\": index0:5, index1:5, index2:0, index3:0, index4:1, index5:1, index6:1, index7:5, index8:0, index9:0.\nSo differences: index4 changed from 0 to 1, index5 changed from 0 to 1, index6 changed from 0 to 1, index7 changed? input index7: maybe it's 0? Actually, wait, input row1 index7: it's 0, but output row1 index7: it's 5. So differences: indices 4,5,6,7 changed. Let's check row2: E.g. 1 row2: \"0055000055\" vs output \"0055111055\".\nRow2: input: 0,0,5,5,0,0,0,5,5. Output: 0,0,5,5,1,1,1,5,5? Let's check: positions 4,5,6 become 1,1,1. Row3: \"5505000050\" vs output \"5505111050\": differences: indices 4,5,6 become 1,1,1, index? Let's check: row3: input digits: 5,5,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0.

Analyze provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply the rule to final test input grid.\"\n\nWe are given several examples:\n\nExample 1 Input:\n99090\n90090\n09999\n40040\n44044\n44404\nOutput:\n06000\n06006\n60060\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n90099\n00000\n00909\n00440\n44400\n40404\nOutput:\n60606\n66600\n60000\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n09000\n09909\n90009\n44040\n04440\n44000\nOutput:\n60060\n00066\n06006\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n00990\n99099\n09000\n44000\n40444\n04004\nOutput:\n66660\n06600\n00006\n\nExample 5:\nInput:\n09900\n90009\n90000\n00404\n44040\n40440\nOutput:\n06006\n06066\n00660\n\nThen given test input:\n99090\n00909\n00099\n44404\n40444\n44000\n\nWe need to deduce transformation rule from examples.\n\nObserving examples: we have pairs of grids: each input is a 6-digit string? Actually, careful: The provided examples: Each e.g. input and output. Let's re-read meticulously.\n\nWe are given 5 examples: Each example has:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n99090\n90090\n09999\n40040\n44044\n44404\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n06000\n06006\n60060\n\nObserving structure: The input grid is a 6-digit pattern? But the output grid is 3-digit pattern? Wait, look: In E.g. 1, input grid has 6 rows? It says \"99090\", \"90090\", \"09999\", \"40040\", \"44044\", \"44404\". But output grid is \"06000\", \"06006\", \"60060\". That means from 6 rows input, we produce 3 rows output. Also columns: input rows have 5 columns (or 5 digits)? But output rows have 5 columns also? Let's check: \"99090\" has 5 digits. \"06000\" has 5 digits. So each input grid is 6 rows of 5 columns. And output grid is 3 rows of 5 columns.\n\nSo transformation seems to reduce the grid by half in rows? But not exactly: from 6 rows to 3 rows: factor of 2. But it's not simply taking every alternate row? Let's check E.g. 1: Rows 1,3,5? Let's check: if we take input rows 1,3,5, then they are: row1: 99090, row3: 09999, row5: 44044. But output rows are: row1: 06000, row2: 06006, row3: 60060. They don't match.\n\nMaybe transformation is combining pairs of rows? Perhaps each output row is the result of combining two input rows? But output grid has 3 rows, so perhaps groups of 2 rows from input are merged into one output row?\n\nConsider E.g. 1: Input rows:\nRow1: 99090\nRow2: 90090\nRow3: 09999\nRow4: 40040\nRow5: 44044\nRow6: 44404\n\nMaybe we combine row1+row2 to produce first output row, row3+row4 to produce second output row, row5+row6 to produce third output row. Let's test that:\n\nFor E.g. 1, combine row1 and row2 element-wise? Let's see: row1: 99090, row2: 90090. How to combine? Possibly taking difference between digits? The output first row is \"06000\". How to get \"0\" from \"9\" and \"9\"? Possibly 9-9=0, or 9-9=0. The next digit: row1:0, row2:0, 0-0=0. Third digit: row1:9, row2:0, difference? 9-0=9, but output is 0, so maybe something else.\n\nAlternate possibility: Could it be taking absolute difference of corresponding digits? For row1: digits: 9,9,0,9,0 and row2: 9,0,0,9,0.\nAbsolute differences: |9-9|=0, |9-0|=9, |0-0|=0, |9-9|=0, |0-0|=0. That gives \"09000\", not \"06000\".\n\nWhat about sum modulo something? Sum: 9+9=18, but output is 0? Possibly subtracting one digit from the other? But then 9-9=0, 9-0=9, 0-0=0, 9-9=0, 0-0=0 yields \"09000\" if we do row1 minus row2. But if we do row2 minus row1: 9-9=0, 0-9=-9, absolute? No.\n\nMaybe it's bitwise XOR? Let's try bitwise XOR of 9 and 9. But 9 in binary is 1001, but that doesn't yield 0? Let's try: 9 XOR 9 = 0, 9 XOR 0 = 9, 0 XOR 0 = 0, 9 XOR 9 = 0, 0 XOR 0 = 0, which gives 0,9,0,0,0 in binary? That would be 09000, not 06000.\n\nMaybe it's bitwise AND? 9 & 9 = 9, then 9 & 0 = 0, etc. Not sure.\n\nMaybe it's taking the difference mod something? The difference between 9 and 9 is 0, but then the next pair is 9 and 0, which gives 9, but we want 0. So maybe it's not simple arithmetic difference.\n\nMaybe it's logical: count of something like: \"if digits are equal then output 0, if not equal then output something else\"? Let's check: row1: 9 and row2: 9 are equal, so output 0. Next pair: 9 and 0 are different, so output maybe 6? Then 0 and 0 are equal, so output 0, then 9 and 9 equal gives 0, then 0 and 0 equal gives 0. That would yield something like \"06000\" if we consider each column independently, but then row1 and row2: column 1: 9 and 9 equal => 0, column2: 9 and 0 not equal => ? But what digit? For second row, maybe if digits differ then output might be 6. Let's test this hypothesis with other examples:\n\nE.g. 1, if we pair rows 1 and 2:\nColumn 1: 9 and 9, equal => output 0.\nColumn 2: 9 and 0, not equal => output 6.\nColumn 3: 0 and 0, equal => 0.\nColumn 4: 9 and 9, equal => 0.\nColumn 5: 0 and 0, equal => 0.\nThat yields \"06000\". That matches first output row.\n\nNow check second output row: should be from row3 and row4:\nRow3: 09999, row4: 40040.\nColumn1: 0 and 4, different => output 6.\nColumn2: 9 and 0, different => output 6.\nColumn3: 9 and 0, different => output 6.\nColumn4: 9 and 4, different => output 6.\nColumn5: 9 and 0, different => output 6.\nThat would yield \"66666\", but the actual output row is \"06006\". So that doesn't match.\n\nMaybe then the pairing isn't by rows? Perhaps each output row is a transformation of some columns? Let's try pairing columns? But then there are 5 columns. But output columns are also 5 columns. Possibly the transformation is per column, combining two input columns? But then we need grouping of columns: 5 columns becomes maybe 3 columns if we group columns pairwise? But that doesn't divide evenly. Alternatively, maybe transformation is done on diagonals?\n\nI need to re-read examples more carefully.\n\nObserving the input grid dimensions: 6 rows, each row with 5 columns. Output grid: 3 rows, 5 columns. So the transformation seems to compress the grid vertically by a factor of 2, i.e., combine two rows into one output row. But how exactly? Let's denote input rows as A, B, C, D, E, F and output rows as X, Y, Z, where X is a combination of rows A and B, Y is combination of rows C and D, Z is combination of rows E and F.\n\nNow let's try to see pattern column-wise for each output row.\n\nLet's denote each row as a string of digits. We'll denote them as arrays.\n\nE.g.1:\nA: 9 9 0 9 0\nB: 9 0 0 9 0\nC: 0 9 9 9 9\nD: 4 0 0 4 0\nE: 4 4 0", "prompt_tokens": 602, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" The task description states that the user will provide several pairs. They gave the examples as E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, then final test input. We have to provide the transformation rule deduced from the examples and then apply it to the test input grid to produce the correct test output grid.\n\nWe have examples:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n444\n000\n000\nOutput:\n445\n555\n555\n\nObservations: The input grid is 3x3, and the transformation is: 444 becomes 445, then 000 becomes 555, then 000 becomes 555. It seems the transformation might be converting certain digits to new ones. Let's try to deduce: input digits: '4', '0'. output: '4' becomes '5'? Actually, output grid: first row: \"445\", second row: \"555\", third row: \"555\". So in the first row, the first two cells were \"44\", but the third cell changed from \"4\" to \"5\"? But the first row was \"444\" but output is \"445\", so the rightmost column changed from '4' to '5'.\n\nMaybe the rule is: find the corners in the grid or something? Let's check E.g. 1: The initial grid has all rows except maybe the first row is all 4's. But then output: row1: \"445\", row2: \"555\", row3: \"555\". So seems that the transformation replaced digit '4' with '5' in some parts but left one \"4\"? But not exactly.\n\nLet's check E.g. 2:\nInput grid is 8 rows x 8 columns.\nRow1: 00000000 becomes 55555555\nRow2: 00333300 becomes 53333555\nRow3: 00000000 becomes 55555555\nRow4: 00000000 becomes 55555555\nRow5: 03300000 becomes 33555555\nRow6: 00000000 becomes 55555555\nRow7: 00000000 becomes 55555555\nRow8: 00000000 becomes 55555555\n\nObserving pattern: The transformation seems to be: the digit '3' becomes '5' except in some cases, and the digit '0' becomes '5' apparently except in some cases, but then sometimes digit '3' remains '3'? Wait, in row2, input \"00333300\", output \"53333555\". Let's compare column by column.\n\nMaybe the rule is: if cell is not on the border, then change it to 5. But check row2: positions: 0: input '0', output '5'? Actually row2: \"00333300\". In output, we have \"53333555\". So the first digit is 0 becomes 5, second digit from input is 0 becomes 3? Let's check: 00333300 -> output: 53333555. Let's compare columns:\ncol1: input '0', output '5'\ncol2: input '0', output '3'\ncol3: input '3', output '3'\ncol4: input '3', output '3'\ncol5: input '3', output '3'\ncol6: input '0', output '5'\ncol7: input '0', output '5'\ncol8: input '0', output '5'.\n\nWait, but row1: input \"00000000\" becomes \"55555555\". So transformation is not uniform across rows. Let's check row5: \"03300000\" becomes \"33555555\". Compare column by column:\ncol1: input '0', output '3'? \ncol2: input '3', output '3'? \ncol3: input '3', output '5'? \ncol4: input '0', output '5'? \ncol5: input '0', output '5'? \ncol6: input '0', output '5'? \ncol7: input '0', output '5'? \ncol8: input '0', output '5'.\n\nWait, let's re-read E.g.2. We must re-read the provided E.g. 2 input and output pairs. They are given as:\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\n00000000\n00333300\n00000000\n00000000\n03300000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n\nE.g. 2 Output:\n55555555\n53333555\n55555555\n55555555\n33555555\n55555555\n55555555\n55555555\n\nLet's align coordinates. I'll denote coordinates as (row, col) with row index starting at 0.\n\nCoordinates:\n\nRow0: input \"00000000\" -> output \"55555555\". So every cell becomes 5.\nRow1: input \"00333300\" -> output \"53333555\". Let's index columns 0-indexed:\n- (1,0): input '0', output '5'\n- (1,1): input '0', output '3'\n- (1,2): input '3', output '3'\n- (1,3): input '3', output '3'\n- (1,4): input '3', output '3'\n- (1,5): input '0', output '5'\n- (1,6): input '0', output '5'\n- (1,7): input '0', output '5'\nRow2: input \"00000000\" -> output \"55555555\".\nRow3: input \"00000000\" -> output \"55555555\".\nRow4: input \"03300000\" -> output \"33555555\".\nRow5: input \"00000000\" -> output \"55555555\".\nRow6: input \"00000000\" -> output \"55555555\".\nRow7: input \"00000000\" -> output \"55555555\".\n\nRow4 details:\n- (4,0): input '0', output '3'\n- (4,1): input '3', output '3'\n- (4,2): input '3', output '5'\n- (4,3): input '0', output '5'\n- (4,4): input '0', output '5'\n- (4,5): input '0', output '5'\n- (4,6): input '0', output '5'\n- (4,7): input '0', output '5'.\n\nRow1 details: The middle block \"333\" remains \"333\". But the left two digits become 5 and 3 respectively? Wait, row1: columns 0 and 1: originally '0's become '5' and '3'? But then columns 5,6,7: originally '0's become '5's. So row1: the first two become 5 and 3, then middle three remain 3's, then last three become 5's. Row4: first two digits become 3 and 3, then column 2 becomes 5, then columns 3-7 become 5's.\n\nMaybe rule is: color filling based on connected components? Possibly a flood fill? The examples might be about connectivity. Let's check E.g.1: Input: \nRow0: 444, row1: 000, row2: 000.\nOutput: row0 becomes \"445\", row1 becomes \"555\", row2 becomes \"555\". In the output, the digit 5 appears everywhere except one cell remains 4. Which cell remains 4? It is the top left cell? Actually, row0: \"445\", so cell (0,0) is 4, then (0,1) is 4 as well? Wait, let's check: row0: \"444\" input, output \"445\": So cells maybe changed: (0,0) remains 4? But then row1 and row2 become 555. But wait, check row0: \"444\" -> \"445\", so only the last digit became 5. In row1 and row2, all digits became 5. So maybe the transformation is: take the input grid, and change all digits except one? That doesn't seem consistent.\n\nMaybe the transformation is: Replace every digit with a different digit based on parity or something? But then E.g.1: '4' becomes '5' and '0' becomes '5'? But then why is one of the 4's not changed to 5? Let's re-read E.g.1 carefully.\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\nRow0: \"444\"\nRow1: \"000\"\nRow2: \"000\"\nOutput:\nRow0: \"445\"\nRow1: \"555\"\nRow2: \"555\"\n\nObserving: The output grid has only digits 4 and 5. And the pattern: In the output, the top-left cell remains 4, and all other cells become 5. Check row0: originally \"444\", but in output row0 becomes \"445\". So the last cell in row0 changed from 4 to 5? But then row1 and row2 become all 5's. So what distinguishes the top-left cell? Possibly it is the \"boundary\" of a shape? Consider connectivity: The input grid might have been a shape with digit 4. For instance, maybe the transformation is: replace the color of the cells that are adjacent to the shape? But then why would the top", "prompt_tokens": 603, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check the examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput (7 rows, 7 columns, all zeros) transform to Output:\nRow1: 1111111\nRow2: 1010101\nRow3: 1111111\nRow4: 1010101\nRow5: 1111111\nRow6: 1010101\nRow7: 1111111\n\nSimilarly, example2 is 5 rows, 5 columns zeros -> Output:\nRow1: 11111\nRow2: 10101\nRow3: 11111\nRow4: 10101\nRow5: 11111\n\nExample3: 9 rows, 9 columns zeros -> Output:\nRow1: 111111111\nRow2: 101010101\nRow3: 111111111\nRow4: 101010101\nRow5: 111111111\nRow6: 101010101\nRow7: 111111111\nRow8: 101010101\nRow9: 111111111\n\nIt is consistent: transformation rule is that for each grid of zeros, the output grid has alternating pattern of 1 and 0 in a chessboard pattern, starting with 1 on the top left cell perhaps.\n\nWait, check details: row1 is all ones, row2 is alternating starting with 0? Actually check: row2: \"1010101\": if we align the pattern, we see: first cell of row2 is \"1\"? Actually check: row2: \"1010101\". Let's check: row2: column1=1, column2=0, column3=1, column4=0, column5=1, column6=0, column7=1. And row1: \"1111111\" all ones. row3: \"1111111\", row4: \"1010101\", etc. So pattern is: odd rows are all ones, even rows are alternating starting with 1? Wait, let's check row2 \"1010101\": if we consider chessboard pattern, then if we start with 1 at top left, then a chessboard pattern would be: odd rows: all ones, even rows: alternating starting with 0. But here row2 starts with 1, so not exactly chessboard. Let's check: row1: 1111111, row2: 1010101, row3: 1111111, row4: 1010101, row5: 1111111, row6: 1010101, row7: 1111111. Wait, check row2: \"1010101\": if we assume chessboard pattern with top-left as 1, then row1: (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1) but given row1 is \"1111111\"? So it's not chessboard pattern. Let's analyze pattern: It appears that the first row is completely ones, second row is alternating starting with 1 as well, but then odd rows are all ones, even rows alternate starting with 1? Let's check: row2: \"1010101\": if row2 is alternating starting with 1, then row2 should be: 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1. And row1: \"1111111\" is not alternating. So rule is: odd rows become completely filled with ones, even rows are alternating between one and zero starting with one. Let's check example 2: row1: 11111, row2: 10101, row3: 11111, row4: 10101, row5: 11111. And example3: same pattern. Let's check: The pattern is: if row index is odd, then row becomes all ones. If row index is even, then row becomes alternating pattern starting with 1 then 0 then 1 then 0 etc.\n\nBut wait, check row2 of example1: \"1010101\". But what about row4: \"1010101\". Also row6: \"1010101\". And row2 in example2: \"10101\", row4: \"10101\". And row2 in example3: \"101010101\", row4: \"101010101\", row6: \"101010101\", row8: \"101010101\". So pattern is consistent: odd rows are all ones, even rows alternate between 1 and 0 starting with 1. But does the column position matter? In row2, column1=1, column2=0, column3=1, column4=0, column5=1,... So rule: For each cell in grid, if the row index is odd, output 1; if row index is even, then if the column index is odd, output 1; if column index is even, output 0. But wait, check row2: col2 is even so output 0, yes; row2: col1 odd so output 1. So yes.\n\nDouble-check: But what about example1 with row3: all ones, row3 is odd so all ones, so yes.\n\nSo conclusion: Transformation rule: For input grid of zeros, produce grid such that: For odd rows, every cell becomes 1. For even rows, every odd-indexed column becomes 1 and every even-indexed column becomes 0. But wait, is that rule consistent with e.g. example2 row2? Let's check: row2, col1 odd -> 1, col2 even -> 0, col3 odd -> 1, col4 even -> 0, col5 odd -> 1. So yes.\n\nBut let's check example1 row2: col1 odd => 1, col2 even => 0, col3 odd => 1, col4 even => 0, col5 odd => 1, col6 even => 0, col7 odd => 1. Perfect.\n\nSo transformation rule is: simply recolor zeros grid into a pattern of alternating rows: odd rows all ones, even rows alternate 1 and 0 starting with 1. But wait, check: row2 \"1010101\" is even row, but note that in a chessboard pattern starting with top left 1, row2 should be \"0101010\", but here it's different. So rule is: odd rows: all ones, even rows: alternate starting with 1. So pattern is essentially: For row r, if r is odd, then grid[r] = [1]*width, if r is even, then grid[r] = [1 if col index is odd, else 0]. But wait: In row2, starting with col1 odd, so that gives 1, then col2 even gives 0, etc.\n\nI want to check consistency with provided examples: They are all 0 grids. So rule is independent of input grid content. So answer: Given test input grid, which is 11 rows of 10 zeros. Let's denote rows 1 to 11. For odd rows (1,3,5,7,9,11), output row is all ones. For even rows (2,4,6,8,10), output row is alternating pattern starting with 1 then 0 then 1 then 0 then 1 then 0 then 1 then 0 then 1? Wait, the test input grid is 11 rows x 11 columns (since each row \"00000000000\" has 11 zeros, because \"00000000000\" is 11 zeros). Actually check: \"00000000000\" length: count zeros. \"00000000000\" is indeed 11 zeros because there are 11 characters? Let's count: \"0\" repeated 11 times. Actually check: Provided test input lines: There are 11 lines, each \"00000000000\". Count digits: \"00000000000\" = 11 zeros if we count: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 yes 11 zeros. So grid size is 11 rows, 11 columns.\n\nSo output grid for test input: rows 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 become all ones: \"11111111111\" (11 ones)\nRows 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 become alternating starting with 1. Let's compute: For row2: columns:\ncol1: odd -> 1\ncol2: even -> 0\ncol3: odd -> 1\ncol4: even -> 0\ncol5: odd -> 1\ncol6: even -> 0\ncol7: odd -> 1\ncol8: even -> 0\ncol9: odd -> 1\ncol10: even -> 0\ncol11: odd -> 1\nSo row2 becomes: \"10101010101\". Similarly row4: \"10101010101\", row6: \"10101010101\", row8: \"10101010101\", row10: \"10101010101\".\n\nThus final answer is:\n\nRow1: 11111111111\nRow2: 10101010101\nRow3: 11111111111\nRow4: 10101010101\nRow5: 11111111111\nRow6: 10101010101\nRow7: 11111111111\nRow8: 10101010101\nRow9: 11111111111\nRow10: 10101010101\nRow11: 11111111111\n\nWait, check: There are 11 rows.", "prompt_tokens": 634, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We have e.g. 1, e.g. 2, e.g. 3, e.g. 4 and final test input grid. The problem is: hidden transformation rule. Let me analyze each given example's transformation pattern.\n\nWe have given examples as input and corresponding output. We must determine the transformation rule.\n\nLet's denote each example and try to see pattern.\n\nExample 1:\nInput grid:\nRow0: \"00000000000000000\"\nRow1: \"00000000800000000\"\nRow2: \"00000008880000000\"\nRow3: \"00000800000800000\"\nRow4: \"00008880008880000\"\nRow5: \"00800001110000800\"\nRow6: \"08880000100008880\"\nRow7: \"00000000000000000\"\nRow8: \"00000000000000000\"\n\nOutput:\nRow0: \"00000000000000000\"\nRow1: \"00000001110000000\"\nRow2: \"00000000100000000\"\nRow3: \"00001110001110000\"\nRow4: \"00000100000100000\"\nRow5: \"01110000800001110\"\nRow6: \"00100008880000100\"\nRow7: \"00000000000000000\"\nRow8: \"00000000000000000\"\n\nObserving transformation. We compare input and output. Let's index rows from 0 to 8. They are 9 rows.\n\nObserving pattern: It appears that the transformation might be some kind of \"flip\" along a diagonal or rotation? Possibly the grid is symmetric along a vertical/horizontal center? Wait check: In example 1, the grid is symmetric about center? Let's check coordinates: The center is row4 (0-indexed). But then look at row5 in input: \"00800001110000800\" transforms to \"01110000800001110\" in output row5. That seems like a 180-degree rotation of row5? Not exactly.\n\nWait, let's examine row1 input: \"00000000800000000\" becomes \"00000001110000000\" output. The difference is: in input row1, digits \"8\" at column 7? Actually count columns: count length is 17 columns. Let column indices 0..16. So row1: \"00000000800000000\" => there's \"8\" at col6? Wait, if we count: zero-based: columns: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,... Actually \"00000000800000000\" has 7 zeros then 8 then 0000 then 0000? Let's count carefully: It's 17 characters. The string \"00000000800000000\" if I count: digits: 0: index 0, 1: index 1, etc. Let me check positions: The pattern \"008\" maybe it's a pattern in block. Hard to see.\n\nMaybe the transformation is swapping certain pairs of numbers along diagonals or something.\n\nLet's check example 2:\nInput:\nRow0: \"000000000000\" (12 columns)\nRow1: \"022022022000\"\nRow2: \"020020020000\"\nRow3: \"000000000000\"\nRow4: \"000022003000\"\nRow5: \"000020033000\"\nRow6: \"000000000000\"\nRow7: \"000000000000\"\nRow8: \"000000000000\"\n\nOutput:\nRow0: \"000000000000\"\nRow1: \"003003003000\"\nRow2: \"033033033000\"\nRow3: \"000000000000\"\nRow4: \"000003022000\"\nRow5: \"000033020000\"\nRow6: \"000000000000\"\nRow7: \"000000000000\"\nRow8: \"000000000000\"\n\nObservations: It seems that rows 1 and 2 swapped digits? Look at row1 input: \"022022022000\" becomes \"003003003000\". The transformation replaced 2->? Actually, compare row1 input and row2 input vs row1 output and row2 output? Wait, in the input, row1 is \"022022022000\" and row2 is \"020020020000\". In output, row1 is \"003003003000\" and row2 is \"033033033000\". So it seems that row1 and row2 got swapped? But not exactly. Let's compare segment by segment:\nRow1 input: 022022022000. Row1 output: 003003003000.\nRow2 input: 020020020000. Row2 output: 033033033000.\nMaybe it's a combination of digit swap and reordering of segments.\nMaybe the transformation rule is: \"rotate the grid by 90 degrees\" or \"reflect diagonally\"? Let's test possibility: For example 2, if we rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise, what do we get?\nLet's check: For a 9x12 grid, 90 degree rotation yields a 12x9 grid, but output is same dimensions as input? So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, could it be that the transformation is about transposing rows and columns? Let's check: In example 2, maybe the rule is \"swap the first and last halves of each row\", but that doesn't hold.\n\nMaybe the transformation is: \"flip the grid along its main diagonal\" or \"reflect along anti-diagonal\"? Let's test with example 2: Reflect across main diagonal. For a 9x12 grid, that would yield a 12x9 grid, not same shape. So not that.\n\nMaybe the transformation is: \"rotate the grid 180 degrees\" but then check example 1: if we rotate 180, row0 becomes row8, row1 becomes row7, etc. But row1 in output is \"00000001110000000\", while row7 in input is \"00000000000000000\". That doesn't match.\n\nMaybe it's \"mirror about vertical center column\" or \"mirror about horizontal center row\". Let's test example 1: Reflect input horizontally across center row (vertical reflection along center column) i.e. reverse each row. Check row1: \"00000000800000000\" reversed becomes \"00000080000000000\"? That doesn't match \"00000001110000000\". Not that.\n\nMaybe it's \"swap pairs of digits\" like 0<->1, or 0<->? Possibly the transformation is a digit substitution along specific positions. Look at example 1 differences: The numbers that appear in input: 0, 8. In output, 0 and 1 appear. Similarly, Example 2: input digits: 0,2,3 maybe? Actually, input row1: \"022022022000\": digits are 0 and 2. Output row1: \"003003003000\": digits are 0 and 3. Input row2: \"020020020000\": digits are 0 and 2, output row2: \"033033033000\": digits are 0 and 3. Also row4 input: \"000022003000\": digits 0,2,3? Actually, it has 0,2,3. Output row4: \"000003022000\": digits swapped? Wait, check: row4 input \"000022003000\": if we swap every 2 with 3 and every 3 with 2, then 2 becomes 3 and 3 becomes 2. Let's test row1: \"022022022000\" swap 2->3,3->2 becomes \"033033033000\", which is row2 output, not row1. But row2 output is \"033033033000\", and row1 output is \"003003003000\". So the swapping is not uniform across rows.\n\nMaybe the transformation is: \"flip the rows vertically\" (swap row order) and then swap digits? Let's check example 2: If we reverse row order: then row1 input becomes row7 output? That doesn't align.\n\nMaybe the transformation is \"diagonally mirror\" i.e. reflect along the NW-SE diagonal, and then swap certain digits? \n\nWait, check example 1 again carefully. I'll list coordinates with row, col indices. Let grid size be 9x17.\nRow0: all zeros.\nRow1: \"00000000800000000\". There is an \"8\" at column 7? Let's index: columns 0...16.\nActually, I need to count carefully: \"00000000800000000\" length=17. Count zeros: positions 0-6 are zeros, then char7 is \"8\", then positions 8-11 zeros, then positions 12-16 zeros. So the pattern is: at row1, col7 is 8.\nRow2: \"00000008880000000\": likely pattern: zeros from col0 to 5, then \"888\" from col6-8 maybe? Let's count: \"000000\" (6 zeros) then \"888\" (3 eights) then \"00000\" (5 zeros) equals 6+3+5=14, but we need 17. Let's recalc: \"00000008880000000\" length: count characters: \n0,0,0,0,0,0, (6 zeros) then 8,8,8, (3 eights) then 0,0,0,0,0,0, (6 zeros) but that sums to 6+3+6=15. Wait, need to re-read carefully.

Replacement of digits possibly.\n- Observing row2: the input digits: \"0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 0\". Output row2: digits: \"0 0 2 2 2 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 3 3 3 0 1 1 1 0 0\"? Wait, count length: input row2 is 23 characters, output row2 is also 23? Let's check: \"00222011101110333011100\" count: 2 zeros, then 4 digits \"2220\"? Let's count carefully.\n\nLet's count e.g.1 row2 output: \"00222011101110333011100\" length: count characters: \"00\" (2), then \"2220\" (4) =6, then \"1110\" (4) =10, then \"1110\" (4) =14, then \"3330\" (4) =18, then \"1110\" (4) =22, then \"00\" (2) =24? That seems to be 24 characters, but row in input seems to be 23 characters? Let's recalc: Actually, the given grid in e.g.1 input row2 \"00555055505550555055500\" is 23 characters? Let's count: \"0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 0\". That's 23 digits.\nNow output row2 \"00222011101110333011100\": count digits: I'll count manually:\n\"00\" (2), \"2220\" (4, total 6), \"1110\" (4, total 10), \"1110\" (4, total 14), \"3330\" (4, total 18), \"1110\" (4, total 22), \"00\" (2, total 24). So output row2 length is 24. But input row2 is 23. Wait, check input row2 in e.g.1: \"00555055505550555055500\" count digits: Let's count char by char:\nIndex: 0:0, 1:0, 2:5, 3:5, 4:5, 5:0, 6:5, 7:5, 8:5, 9:0, 10:5, 11:5, 12:5, 13:0, 14:5, 15:5, 16:5, 17:0, 18:5, 19:5, 20:5, 21:0, 22:0. So length = 23.\nBut output row2 is 24 digits. That suggests maybe there's a padding or transformation that adds one extra digit in some rows? Let\u2019s check row3:\nInput row3: \"00505050505050505050500\". Count digits: length =? Count: \"00\" then \"5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0\"? Let's count: There are 23 characters (since provided pattern \"0050\" repeated might be 23 digits). Output row3: \"00202010101010303010100\". Count: \"00\" (2) then \"2020\" (4) then \"1010\" (4) then \"1030\" (4) then \"1010\" (4) then \"00\" (2) equals 20? Let's count properly:\n\"00202010101010303010100\" count digits: digits: \n\"00\" =2, \"2020\" =4 (total6), \"1010\"=4 (total10), \"1030\"=4 (total14), \"1010\"=4 (total18), \"00\"=2 (total20). So row3 output length is 20, which is different from input length.\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let's re-read the provided example outputs carefully. They are given as lines of text with quotes? They appear to be provided as examples with each row shown on a new line. Let\u2019s re-read the prompt from the user message.

Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" We are given four example transformation pairs (E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, E.g. 4) with input grids and output grids; then it gives \"Test Input\" grid. The final answer should be produced as JSON list-of-lists in a final answer. We need to produce answer with explanation in <thinking> of 5 or fewer steps. And then final answer in <answer>.\n\nWe have four examples, each with input and output. We need to deduce the transformation rule. Let's analyze examples.\n\nLet's denote grid as a 2D array of characters (digits '0', '8', '2', etc). The transformation rule is likely \"filling in gaps\" with numbers that are related to adjacent numbers or summing digits or pattern. Possibly the rule is: For any contiguous region of \"8\" or \"2\" (or maybe \"8\" turning into \"7\")? Alternatively, the transformation might be: some digits become 7, and some become 8 in the output.

Look at line 3: Input: \"000000000000000000\" but output line 3: \"000007700000000000\". So a \"7\" pattern inserted.\n- In line 6: Input: \"000008800008800000\" becomes output: \"000008877778800000\". So the region originally with \"888000008800000\" turned into \"888777788800000\" (the part in the middle changed from 8's to 7's). Similarly, lines 17: \"000008800008800000\" becomes \"000008877778800000\".\n\nWait, check line 17: same pattern.\n- Also line 1 and 2 remain unchanged.\n\n- Also line 23: \"000002200000000000\" remains unchanged.\n\n- The pattern \"7\" appears in contiguous blocks in the middle of the grid. Also, line 3, 4, 5 become replaced by \"7's\" in the central region. And then lines 8 to 16 become \"007700000077700000\"? Wait, check lines 8 to 16: They become \"000000000007700000\", \"000000000007700000\", \"000000000007700000\", \"000000000007700000\", \"000000000007700000\", etc. They always have \"777\" group inserted in the middle.\n\n- But what is the rule? Might be: The transformation seems to \"thicken\" the vertical boundaries around \"8\" regions? Alternatively, maybe it's like drawing a \"fence\" around the \"8\" blocks with \"7\" digits. But then what about the \"8\" digit at the edges? They become \"7\" in the middle segments? Wait, let's consider: The first example: The \"8\" blocks appear on line1,2 and line6,7,17,18? Actually, let me note coordinates:\n\nGrid rows are 26 rows, columns 19 columns? Actually, count columns: \"000000000000000000\" has 18 zeros? Let's count: Actually, in example 1, each line length: For line 0: \"000000000000000000\" (20 characters? Actually, count: \"000000000000000000\" has 20 characters? Let's count: It might be 20 columns, but then sometimes we see \"000002200000000000\" which is 23 characters? Let's count precisely. Actually, look at line 23: \"000002200000000000\" has 21 characters? Let's count: 3 zeros, then 220, then 8 zeros? Let's count: \"000002200000000000\" Count digits: \"00000\" is 5 zeros, then \"22\" then 0000000000? I need to re-read the string carefully.\nWait, I'll re-read the first example input lines carefully:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n000000000000000000\n000008800000000000\n000008800000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000008800008800000\n000008800008800000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000008800008800000\n000008800008800000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000000000000000000\n000002200000000000\n000002200000000000\n000000000000000000\n\nCount columns: In line 1: \"000008800000000000\" has length? Count: There are 18 digits? Actually, let me count manually: \"000008800000000000\" \n- There are 3 zeros, then \"88\", then 0000? Wait, let me count carefully: I'll count characters: \n\"000008800000000000\"\nIndices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0? Wait, I'll count: The string \"000008800000000000\" seems ambiguous because of formatting. I assume columns are consistent. But the transformation rule likely doesn't depend on grid dimensions.\n\nNow, the transformation rule: It seems that the output grid is produced by \"drawing\" a pattern that is like a \"staircase\" or \"boundary\" around clusters of non-zero digits? Wait, look at example 2:\nE.g. 2:\nInput: There are 26 rows? Actually, let's count rows in E.g. 2 input. It appears to have 28 rows maybe. But I'll focus on pattern.\nE.g. 2 Input lines:\nLine 0: \"0000000000000000000000000000\" (31 characters? maybe).\nLine 1: \"0880000000000000000000000000\"\nLine 2: \"0880000000000000000000000000\"\nLine 3: \"0000000000000000000000000000\"\nLine 4: \"0000000000000000000000000000\"\nLine 5: \"0000000000000000000000000000\"\nLine 6: \"0008800000000088000000000000\"\nLine 7: \"000880000", "prompt_tokens": 2313, "completion_tokens": 2048}

{"task_id": "34b99a2b", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus:free", "raw_response": "We are given four example input-output pairs, and a test input grid. They are from the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). The examples are provided in text and then we have a test input grid. We need to determine the transformation rule from the examples and then apply it to the test input grid.\n\nWe are given four examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n880040550\n880840055\n000040050\n880040555\n800840005\nOutput:\n2020\n2220\n0020\n2022\n2000\n\nWait, reading the first example: It seems each example is 5 rows of digits. The digits: each row is length 9 digits? Actually check: \"880040550\" is 9 digits, so it's a grid with 5 rows and 9 columns. So input grid: 5 rows by 9 columns. But output grid: \"2020\", \"2220\", \"0020\", \"2022\", \"2000\" are rows with 4 digits each. Wait, each output row is 4 digits. But wait, the provided outputs in E.g. 1: They say:\nE.g. 1 Output:\n2020\n2220\n0020\n2022\n2000\n\nThat is 5 rows of 4 digits each? Actually check: \"2020\" is length 4. \"2220\" length 4, \"0020\", \"2022\", \"2000\". So output grid is 5 rows by 4 columns.\n\nSo transformation from input grid (5x9) to output grid (5x4)? But then examples 2,3,4: They are also 5 rows by 9 digits? Let's examine example 2:\nInput:\n080045050\n080845055\n080840005\n080840505\n000840050\nOutput:\n2220\n2220\n0200\n0000\n0022\nWait, each output row is 4 digits. Example 3:\nInput:\n080040550\n880845005\n880045005\n080840050\n008040505\nOutput:\n0020\n0200\n0202\n0222\n0222\nEach output row is 4 digits. E.g. 4:\nInput:\n000840555\n088840500\n800040505\n808845550\n088045005\nOutput:\n0220\n0022\n2202\n0202\n2222\n\nSo pattern: Each input is a 5x9 grid, each output is a 5x4 grid. The transformation rule is not trivial like simply reading digits? Let me look at grid positions.\n\nMaybe we try to see pattern from examples. I'll denote row index from top (0 to 4) and column index from left (0 to 8). The outputs are 4-digit numbers, so maybe each output row is derived from some columns in the input row. Possibly columns 1-4? But let's check: For E.g. 1, row0 input: \"880040550\", row0 output: \"2020\". Which columns used? Maybe columns 1,2,3,4? Let's check: row0 input digits: 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0. If we take columns 1,2,3,4, we get \"8 0 0 4\" which is \"8004\", not \"2020\". If we take columns possibly 0,1,3,? Let's check: maybe transformation rule is something like \"replace some digits\"? Alternatively, maybe the transformation is a function of the input grid as a whole. Possibly each output cell is computed by scanning the corresponding row and column intersections. Possibly a rule that sums digits in certain regions? The pattern \"2020\", \"2220\", etc, might denote some pattern of counting zeros and non-zeros.\n\nMaybe consider positions: Look at example 1, row 0: input \"880040550\", output \"2020\". In output, digits are 2, 0, 2, 0. They might be computed from counts of something. Let's check row 1: input \"880840055\", output \"2220\". Row 2: \"000040050\", output \"0020\". Row 3: \"880040555\", output \"2022\". Row 4: \"800840005\", output \"2000\".\n\nI observe that output digits are only 0, 2. They are even, maybe computed by doubling something like \"1\" and \"0\"? Perhaps the transformation is that each digit in the output is 2 if the corresponding cell in the input (or some aggregated region) is 1, and 0 if input is 0. But then where do we get ones? The output \"2020\" would then mean: first digit is 2, second is 0, third is 2, fourth is 0, that might correspond to some pattern in the input row. Possibly the input row \"880040550\" might have some pattern: maybe count of non-zero digits in groups? Wait, check row 0 input: \"880040550\". It has a pattern: segment \"8800\" at beginning, then \"40550\" at end. But output \"2020\" suggests alternating pattern.\n\nMaybe consider summing columns? For each row, output row has 4 digits. Possibly each output digit corresponds to a 3x3 submatrix from the input grid? But 9 columns, 5 rows, if we divide into 3 columns groups, then 3 groups of 3 columns, but output has 4 columns, so not that.\n\nMaybe the transformation used in ARC tasks sometimes involves \"folding\" or \"schematic\" extraction. Perhaps each output digit is computed by scanning a column in the input grid? For instance, maybe output column j is computed from some function of input columns j+? Possibly the rule involves taking the second half of the row and mirroring the first half? Let's check: For row0 in example 1, input \"880040550\". If we split into two halves: left half \"88004\" and right half \"0550\", then maybe compare them? Not sure.\n\nMaybe look at differences between input and output across examples. Let's denote input and output rows as sequences of digits. I suspect the rule might be \"replace each digit with 2 if it has a neighboring digit that is not zero, else 0\"? But then row 0 \"880040550\" would become \"880040550\" with many 8's replaced maybe by 2? But then output \"2020\" only has two digits 2 and zeros. So maybe it's not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each output digit corresponds to a count of something in the input row? For instance, maybe output digit is 2 if in the corresponding input row, the sum of digits in some segment equals 4, else 0? But then row 0: \"880040550\", sum equals 8+8+0+0+4+0+5+5+0 = 30, not 4.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule sums the digits in each 3x3 block? But output grid is 5x4, which doesn't match a partition of a 9x5 grid.\n\nWait, I note that in all examples, the output has exactly 4 digits per row. So maybe the rule is to take the input row and remove the first and last columns? For example, row 0 of example 1: \"880040550\" remove first and last digit gives \"8004055\" which is 8 digits, not 4 digits.\n\nMaybe each output digit corresponds to a \"diagonal\" sum? For instance, maybe the output row is computed by taking the sum of the digits in the input row's 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th positions? Let's test that for example 1 row0: positions 1,3,5,7 (0-indexed): digits: index1:8, index3:0, index5:0, index7:5, sum = 8+0+0+5 = 13, not 2. Maybe mod something? 13 mod something? 13 mod 7? Not sure.\n\nMaybe each output digit is simply the digit at a corresponding position in the input row but then replaced by (digit mod something) like 8 becomes 2? For example, in E.g. 1, row0 input first digit is 8, output first digit is 2. Row0 output second digit is 0, input second digit is 8? Possibly rule: if digit is 8 then output 2? Check row1: input first digit 8, output first digit 2? But row1 input first digit is 8, output first digit is 2. Row2 input first digit 0, output first digit 0. Row3 input first digit 8, output first digit 2. Row4 input first digit 8, output first digit 2. So maybe rule: output digit = (input digit) - 6 if >6? But then 8 becomes 2, 0 remains 0, 4 becomes? But row0: second digit input is 8, but output second digit is 0. So not consistent.\n\nMaybe it's not per cell transformation but a pattern extraction from the grid. Perhaps the output grid is obtained by reading off the positions of \"holes\" or \"walls\". For instance, many ARC tasks involve drawing a new grid that highlights positions where \"1\" touches \"0\" or something.\n\nLet's try to see patterns in the output relative to input. Look at example 1. Compare input row 0 \"880040550\" and output row", "prompt_tokens": 595, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The examples are \"E.g. 1\" and \"E.g. 2\", and then the test input is a grid with 16 lines of 16 characters (or maybe more?) Let's check details in provided examples.\n\nLet's re-read the problem text: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\"\n\nWe are given \"E.g. 1 Input:\" and \"E.g. 1 Output:\" and \"E.g. 2 Input:\" and \"E.g. 2 Output:\".\n\nWe have multiple lines with grid patterns. They are arranged probably with line breaks.\n\nLet's re-read the provided examples. E.g. 1:\nE.g. 1 Input:\n0000000000000\n0223000000000\n0000000000000\n5555555555555\n0000000000000\n0022300000000\n0000000000000\n5555555555555\n0000000000000\n0002230000000\n0000000000000\n5555555555555\n0000000000000\n0000223000000\n0000000000000\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n0000000000000\n0000022300000\n0000000000000\n\nObservations: Input grid is 15 lines? Actually, count: E.g. 1 Input: There are 15 lines. Each line has length 13? Let's count. Actually, re-read carefully: The problem uses consistent formatting: It says \"E.g. 1 Input:\" followed by newline separated grid lines.\n\nLet's count the characters in first line of E.g. 1 Input: \"0000000000000\". That seems to be 13 or 14 digits? Let's count: Count digits: \"0000000000000\" if counting: I'll count: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13? Let's count manually: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" If there are 13 zeros? Count them: Actually, I'll count: \"0000000000000\" is 13 zeros if each dash is one zero? Wait, let's count carefully: The string \"0000000000000\" if there are 13 zeros, then positions indices 0 to 12. But the next line \"0223000000000\" is also length 13. The next line \"0000000000000\" is 13. Then \"5555555555555\" if there are 13 digits? Let's count: \"5555555555555\" has 13 digits? Count: 5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5. Then \"0000000000000\", \"0022300000000\", \"0000000000000\", \"5555555555555\", \"0000000000000\", \"0002230000000\", \"0000000000000\", \"5555555555555\", \"0000000000000\", \"0000223000000\", \"0000000000000\". Total lines: 15 lines. So input grid size is 15 rows by 13 columns. E.g. 1 Output: \n0000000000000\n0000022300000\n0000000000000\nThat's 3 rows by 13 columns.\nSimilarly, E.g. 2 Input:\n0000000000000\n1100000000000\n0000000000000\n5555555555555\n0000000000000\n1111000000000\n0000000000000\n5555555555555\n0000000000000\n1111110000000\n0000000000000\n5555555555555\n0000000000000\n1111111100000\n0000000000000\n\nE.g. 2 Output:\n0000000000000\n1111111111000\n0000000000000\nThat output grid is 3 rows by 13 columns.\n\nSo in both examples, the input grid is 15 rows by 13 columns, and output grid is 3 rows by 13 columns.\n\nNow, what's the transformation? Possibly taking every 5th row? Let's check: The rows that are output in E.g. 1 are row 0, row 1, row 2? Actually, output has 3 rows: from E.g. 1 output: first row \"0000000000000\" is same as input row 0 \"0000000000000\". Second row \"0000022300000\" is not exactly the second row of input. Let's check: E.g. 1 input's second row is \"0223000000000\". But output row 2 is \"0000022300000\". Compare: they swapped the positions maybe. Third row \"0000000000000\" is same as input row 0? Hmm, then what's the rule? Let's try to see structure.\n\nMaybe the rule is: The input grid is composed of three distinct horizontal bands: top band (rows 0, ...?) Actually, look at E.g. 1 input: There are three groups: rows 0-2, then row 3, then rows 4-? Wait, re-read input E.g. 1:\n\nRows, with indices:\n0: 0000000000000\n1: 0223000000000\n2: 0000000000000\n\n3: 5555555555555\n4: 0000000000000\n5: 0022300000000\n\n6: 0000000000000\n7: 5555555555555\n8: 0000000000000\n9: 0002230000000\n10: 0000000000000\n11: 5555555555555\n12: 0000000000000\n13: 0000223000000\n14: 0000000000000\n\nOutput is 3 rows. Possibly the rule is: combine three horizontal stripes from the input? For instance, the top output row is the first row of each stripe? Let's check: For E.g. 1 input, the output is:\nRow 0 of output: \"0000000000000\". That might correspond to row 0 of input? \nRow 1 of output: \"0000022300000\". That might be computed somehow from the stripe in the middle?\nRow 2 of output: \"0000000000000\". Possibly the bottom stripe row? Let's check: The input stripes: maybe stripe 1: rows 0-3 (or 0-2) then row 3? Actually, let's examine pattern: There are 15 rows, and output has 3 rows. Possibly, the rule is to take every 5th row? Because 15/5 = 3. But then which rows? Possibly row 0, row 5, row 10? But then row 0 of output equals row 0 of input \"0000000000000\". For row 5 of input: \"0022300000000\" but output row second equals \"0000022300000\". They are similar but with a shift of digits: \"0022300000000\" becomes \"0000022300000\", which is a cyclic shift: The digits \"223\" from input row 5 become \"00223\" in output row 2? Let's check: \"0022300000000\" vs \"0000022300000\", then difference: In input row 5, the pattern \"0022300000000\" has \"00223\" starting at column 0? Actually, let me align: \"0022300000000\" has pattern \"00223\" at beginning. In output row 2 \"0000022300000\", the \"00223\" appears starting at column 3. There's a shift to the right by 3 positions. For E.g. 2, similarly: output row 1 \"1111111111000\" compared to input row 5 \"1111000000000\"? Wait, check: E.g. 2 input row 1 is \"1100000000000\". But output row 1 is \"1111111111000\". Let's check mapping: maybe the output grid is composed from the middle column of the input grid? Alternatively, maybe the rule is to arrange rows in a cyclic order.\n\nLet's re-read the examples carefully:\n\nE.g. 1 Input: 15 rows.\nLet's label rows from 0 to 14:\nRow0: 0000000000000\nRow1: 0223000000000\nRow2: 0000000000000\nRow3: 5555555555555\nRow4: 0000000000000\nRow5: 0022300000000\nRow6: 0000000000000\nRow7: 5555555555555\nRow8: 0000000000000\nRow9: 0002230000000\nRow10:0000000000000\nRow11:5555555555555\nRow12:0000000000000\nRow13:0000223000000\nRow14:0000000000000\n\nE.g. 1 Output: 3 rows.\nRow0: 0000000000000\nRow1: 0000022300000\nRow2", "prompt_tokens": 713, "completion_tokens": 2048}

There are multiple examples. Each example is a transformation from a grid input to an output. The grids are described as rows of characters (digits). The examples are different transformation tasks, maybe each example corresponds to a different transformation rule. We need to analyze the provided transformation rules. It says \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" There are 4 examples E.g.1, E.g.2, E.g.3, E.g.4, and then a Test Input is provided. We need to deduce the transformation rule from the examples. Possibly each example transformation rule is different. But maybe there's one transformation rule that works for all examples? Or maybe the test input corresponds to one of the examples' transformation rule? We need to look at pattern.\n\nLet's inspect each example:\n\nE.g. 1 Input grid: The text looks like 16 rows or maybe less. Actually, count the rows.\n\nE.g. 1 input:\n\"000000000000000000\" (row1)\n\"007777700000000000\" (row2)\n\"007770700777770000\" (row3)\n\"007077700777770000\" (row4)\n\"007777700707770000\" (row5)\n\"007777700777070000\" (row6)\n\"000000000777770000\" (row7)\n\"000000000000000000\" (row8)\n\"000777770000777770\" (row9)\n\"000777070000707770\" (row10)\n\"000707770000777070\" (row11)\n\"000777770000707770\" (row12)\n\"000777770000777770\" (row13)\n\"000000000000000000\" (row14)\n\nBut wait, the output for E.g. 1 is:\n\"77777\"\n\"70777\"\n\"77707\"\n\"70777\"\n\"77777\"\nSo the output grid is 5x5. So the transformation rule seems to be: take the central 5x5 subgrid of the input grid? Let's check coordinates: The input grid for E.g. 1 is 14 rows, 18 columns. The output grid is 5 rows, 5 columns. Perhaps the rule is to extract a 5x5 submatrix that is \"centered\" in the input grid. But how exactly? Possibly, from E.g. 1: The output is \"77777\" etc. Let me check: The output shows a frame with outer border '7's and inner cell '0'? Let's check: row1 output: \"77777\", row2: \"70777\", row3: \"77707\", row4: \"70777\", row5: \"77777\". So the pattern is like a plus sign maybe? But maybe it's \"pattern recognition\" style ARC problem: transform the input grid into a new grid that highlights a certain pattern. Could it be that the transformation rule is \"draw a plus sign\" or \"draw a pattern\" based on the input grid's structure.\n\nLet's examine E.g. 1 more closely. The grid has many 0's and 7's. The output is 5x5 always. In E.g. 1, the input grid has some pattern. Possibly rule: find the largest connected component of a certain symbol and then \"center\" it? But then E.g. 2: The input grid is 16 rows (or maybe 16 rows?) Actually, E.g. 2 input: \nRow counts: I see 16 lines? Let's count: \nLine1: \"0000000000000088888\"\nLine2: \"0888880000000080888\"\nLine3: \"0808080088888088808\"\nLine4: \"0888880080808080888\"\nLine5: \"0808880088888088888\"\nLine6: \"0888880088808000000\"\nLine7: \"0000000088888000000\"\nLine8: \"0000000000000000000\"\nLine9: \"0000000000008888800\"\nLine10:\"0008888800008880800\"\nLine11:\"0008080800008088800\"\nLine12:\"0008888800008880800\"\nLine13:\"0008080800008888800\"\nLine14:\"0008888800000000000\"\nLine15:\"0000000000000000000\"\n\nOutput E.g. 2 is a 5x5 grid:\n\"88888\"\n\"80808\"\n\"88888\"\n\"80808\"\n\"88888\"\nSo the output is again a 5x5 grid pattern.\nSimilarly, E.g. 3 output is 5x5:\n\"66666\"\n\"60606\"\n\"66666\"\n\"60666\"\n\"66666\"\nE.g. 4 output is 5x5:\n\"22222\"\n\"22222\"\n\"20222\"\n\"22222\"\n\"22222\"\n\nSo all these examples produce a 5x5 output grid. And the input grids are larger. Possibly the transformation is to extract a certain 5x5 area from the input. But what is the selection? Let's compare coordinates.\n\nFor E.g. 1, input grid has dimensions: rows? Count rows: Actually, let's count rows properly:\nE.g. 1:\nRow1: \"000000000000000000\" (18 characters)\nRow2: \"007777700000000000\" (18)\nRow3: \"007770700777770000\"\nRow4: \"007077700777770000\"\nRow5: \"007777700707770000\"\nRow6: \"007777700777070000\"\nRow7: \"000000000777770000\"\nRow8: \"000000000000000000\"\nRow9: \"000777770000777770\" (18)\nRow10:\"000777070000707770\"\nRow11:\"000707770000777070\"\nRow12:\"000777770000707770\"\nRow13:\"000777770000777770\"\nRow14:\"000000000000000000\"\n\nSo input grid is 14 rows, 18 columns.\nOutput is 5 rows, 5 columns.\nMaybe the transformation is \"crop\" the grid to a 5x5 center? But center of 14x18? Center would be rows maybe 4 to 8? Let's check: if we take center 5 rows, then row index starting from (14-5)/2 = 4.5, so maybe rows 5 to 9 if indexing from 1? Actually, if we index rows 1 to 14, the 5 central rows would be rows 5,6,7,8,9 maybe? Let's check: row5 of input in E.g. 1 is \"007777700707770000\". If we take columns from maybe center columns? But output row1 is \"77777\". Let's see: if we take row5 input and extract columns maybe 4 to 8? Let's check: row5: \"007777700707770000\". Its characters: index positions (0-indexed): 0:0,1:0,2:7,3:7,4:7,5:7,6:7,7:0,8:7,9:0,10:7,11:7,12:7,13:7,14:0,15:0,... Actually, wait, length=18. The output row \"77777\" is 5 characters, all 7's. Which contiguous block from input row5 gives \"77777\"? Possibly columns 2-6? Let's check row5: \"007777700707770000\": characters: index:0:0,1:0,2:7,3:7,4:7,5:7,6:7,7:0,8:7,9:0,10:7, ... so if we take indices 2-6, that gives \"77777\". So maybe the rule is: extract a 5x5 subgrid from the input grid, where the subgrid is taken from row index: maybe center row? Possibly the rule: the output grid is the \"center cross\" region of the input grid, i.e., the 5 central rows and 5 central columns. Let's test with E.g. 2: input dimensions? Count rows for E.g. 2:\nRow1: \"0000000000000088888\" (length: count digits: \"000000000000\" = 12 zeros then \"88888\" = 5 8's? Actually, let's count: \"000000000000\" (12 zeros) then \"88888\" (5 eights) gives total 17 digits? Wait, it's \"0000000000000088888\", count: \"000000000000\" is 12, then \"88888\" is 5, so total = 17, but then row2: \"0888880000000080888\": count: \"0\" then \"88888\" then \"000000\" then \"0080888\"? Let's count: \"0\" then \"88888\" (5 digits) then \"000000\" (6 zeros) then \"0080888\" (7 digits)? That sums to 1+5+6+7 = 19, not consistent. Let's count exactly:\nRow1: \"0000000000000088888\"\nI count manually: characters: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8? That would be", "prompt_tokens": 1105, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's try to analyze each example.\n\nObserving e.g. 1:\nInput grid has digits like 0 and 8. In output grid, digits 0 are preserved while 8 becomes something else: In e.g. 1, the output grid uses digits \"0\", \"1\", and \"3\" and \"2\"? Wait check: Let\u2019s analyze row by row for e.g. 1.\n\nRow 0: Input \"00000000000000000\" -> Output \"00000000000000000\" \nSo row 0: unchanged.\n\nRow 1: Input \"08880000000000000\" -> Output \"01110000000000000\"\nLet's compare digits: input row 1: \"08880000000000000\" has pattern: first digit 0, then \"8\", then \"8\", then \"8\", then \"0\", then \"0000000000\"\nOutput row 1: \"01110000000000000\" has pattern: 0, then \"1\", then \"1\", then \"1\", then \"0\", then \"0000000000\". So transformation: 8 becomes 1, but then what about the zeros? They remain zeros.\nCheck row 2: Input \"08080000000000000\" -> Output \"01010000000000000\". Compare: input row 2: \"08080000000000000\" -> pattern: 0,8,0,8,0,0000000000. Output: \"01010000000000000\" -> pattern: 0,1,0,1,0,0000000000. So transformation: the \"8\" becomes \"1\", but also the zeros remain zeros.\nRow 3: Input \"08880888888800000\" -> Output \"01110333333300000\". So pattern: input row 3: \"08880888888800000\" becomes output: \"01110333333300000\". So transformation: the 8's become 1's? But wait, there's a mixture: \"088808888888\" in input becomes \"011103333333\" in output. Let's look carefully:\nInput row 3: \"08880888888800000\"\nBreak that: digits: 0 8 8 8 0 8 888888? Let's do segmentation: \"08880888888800000\". Actually, let's index positions:\nIndices: 0:0, 1:8, 2:8, 3:8, 4:0, 5:8, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8, 10:8, 11:8, 12:0, 13:0, 14:0, 15:0, 16:0, 17:0.\nOutput row 3: \"01110333333300000\"\nThe first three digits: 0,1,1,1,0 then then 3,3,3,3,3,3, then 00000.\nSo transformation on row 3: The digits \"8\" become 1 for the first 1, then for the group of 8's after that, they become 3? Let's check: input \"08880\" becomes \"01110\"? Actually, no: row 3: Input \"08880\" becomes \"01110\"? But then later \"888888\" becomes \"333333\". So maybe it depends on context. Let's check row 4: Input \"08880888880800000\" -> Output \"01110333330300000\". Compare row 3 vs row 4: They differ in the central digit of the pattern. In row 3, the block \"888888\" turned into \"333333\". In row 4, \"08880888880800000\": pattern: likely the same pattern but the middle digit is different: maybe \"8\" becomes \"3\" if it is in the middle of a contiguous block? Let's check row 5: Input \"00000808880800000\" -> Output \"00000303330300000\". Row 5: input: \"00000808880800000\". Let's index: \"00000\" then \"8\" then \"088808000000\"? Let's re-read row 5: \"00000808880800000\". It seems similar to row 4 but with an extra 0 at beginning? Row 5: output \"00000303330300000\". Compare row 6: Input \"00000888088800000\" -> Output \"00000333033300000\".\nRow 7: Input \"00000888888800000\" -> Output \"000", "prompt_tokens": 1282, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check carefully: The text says:\n\n\"E.g. 1 Input:\n98889\n88288\n82228\n88288\n98889\nE.g. 1 Output:\n9888992892\n8828892892\n8222892892\n8828892892\n9888992892\n9999922892\n2222228892\n8888888992\n9999999922\n2222222228\"\n\nWait, the provided output has 10 lines. But the sample input has 5 lines. So transformation rule probably takes a 5x5 grid and outputs a 10x10 grid. Then example 2: \"E.g. 2 Input:\n23332\n33533\n35553\n33533\n23332\nE.g. 2 Output:\n2333225325\n3353325325\n3555325325\n3353325325\n2333225325\n2222255325\n5555553325\n3333333225\n2222222255\n5555555553\"\n\nYes, each example has 5-line input and 10-line output. So transformation: from 5 lines of input, produce 10 lines output.\n\nWe need to deduce transformation rule. Observing differences between input and output grid.\n\nLet's denote grid coordinates maybe row and column indices. The input grid is 5x5, output grid is 10x10. So transformation rule might be something like expansion with some pattern. Let's analyze E.g. 1:\n\nInput:\nRow0: 98889\nRow1: 88288\nRow2: 82228\nRow3: 88288\nRow1: 98889? Wait, let me re-read example 1 input:\n\nIt says:\nE.g. 1 Input:\nLine1: 98889\nLine2: 88288\nLine3: 82228\nLine4: 88288\nLine5: 98889\n\nSo symmetric vertically. The output's first 5 lines are similar to input lines with a twist: Actually compare first 5 lines of output with input:\n\nOutput first 5 lines:\nLine1: 9888992892\nLine2: 8828892892\nLine3: 8222892892\nLine4: 8828892892\nLine5: 9888992892\n\nCompare to input:\nInput line1: 98889 vs output line1 appended \"992\"? Actually, check: output line1: \"9888992892\", while input line1: \"98889\". So the output line is \"98889\" then \"92992\"? Let's check: 98889 then appended \"92992\"? Let me compare: \"98889\" is first 5 digits of output line1, then next digits \"92892\"? Wait, let's break them into two halves maybe.\n\nMaybe the rule is: For each row of the input, append the row reversed? For example, for input row \"98889\", if reversed it's \"98889\" because it's palindromic, but that doesn't match \"9888992892\". Let's try: \"98889\" concatenated with \"92892\"? But \"92892\" is not the reverse of \"98889\". Let's check: reverse of \"98889\" is \"98889\". That doesn't yield \"92892\". Alternatively, maybe the rule is: take the input row and then add a sequence that is the input row with each digit incremented by 1? But 9 becomes 0 maybe? Let's check: If we take the input row \"98889\", then a transformation: maybe the rule is to mirror the input row with some transformation on the mirrored half. For many ARC tasks, the rule is \"reflect the grid and add 1 to the outer ring\" or \"rotate the grid\", but this one is not trivial.\n\nLet's examine differences in the digits in the output grid relative to input grid.\n\nObserving E.g. 1:\nInput row1: 98889\nOutput row1: 9888992892. We see the first 5 digits match input row1 exactly: \"98889\". Then the next 5 digits are \"92892\". Now check row2:\nInput row2: 88288\nOutput row2: 8828892892. The first 5 are same: \"88288\". The next 5 digits: \"92892\" again.\nRow3: Input row3: 82228, output row3: 8222892892.\nRow4: Input row4: 88288, output row4: 8828892892.\nRow5: Input row5: 98889, output row5: 9888992892.\n\nSo for rows 1 to 5, the output row is simply input row concatenated with \"92892\". So the second half of the row is constant across rows 1-5? Let's check row1's appended part: \"92892\". Row2 appended part: \"92892\". So the appended segment is always \"92892\" for the first half of the output grid (i.e. the first 5 rows).\n\nNow look at rows 6 to 10 of output:\nRow6: 9999922892\nRow7: 2222228892\nRow8: 8888888992\nRow9: 9999999922\nRow10: 2222222228\n\nLet's try to see if they have some pattern. Compare row6 with row1 maybe? row6 is \"9999922892\". The first 5 digits \"99999\" vs input row1 \"98889\"? They differ: 9 vs 9, 9 vs 8, 9 vs 8, 9 vs 8, 9 vs 9. So it's like each digit increased by 1 if possible, maybe? Let's check row6 digits: originally input row1: 9,8,8,8,9 become 9,9,9,9,? Actually, row6: first five: 9,9,9,9,2? Wait, let's re-read row6: \"9999922892\". It has 10 digits. Let's break it into two halves: first 5: \"99999\", then second 5: \"22892\". Row7: \"2222228892\" becomes first 5: \"22222\", then second 5: \"28892\". Row8: \"8888888992\" becomes first 5: \"88888\", then second 5: \"89892\". Row9: \"9999999922\": first 5: \"99999\", then \"99922\"? Wait, check row9: \"9999999922\": first 5: \"99999\", second 5: \"99922\"? Row10: \"2222222228\": first 5: \"22222\", second 5: \"22228\".\n\nMaybe the rule is: The output grid is a 10x10 symmetrical pattern where the top half (rows 1-5) are the input rows with a constant appended right half \"92892\". The bottom half (rows 6-10) are generated by some transformation of the top half? In ARC problems, often the transformation is a rotation or reflection with a twist.\n\nMaybe the rule is: The transformation takes a square and produces a larger square by reflecting the original square and then adding a border that is the sum modulo something of the original values. There is a known ARC task \"Add Border\" where you add a row/column of sum of adjacent cells mod 10. But here, the output grid is 10x10, which is double the size of the input grid (5x5). So maybe the rule is: For each cell in the output grid, it's either copied from input if in the top-left quadrant, or computed as something like \"if cell in top half, then output = input cell? Unclear.\n\nMaybe we can think: The output grid seems to be composed of two parts: the top half is just the input rows with an appended constant substring \"92892\". The bottom half is different.\n\nLet's compare top half of output (rows 1-5) with input:\n\nFor each input row, the output row is input row concatenated with \"92892\". So that transformation is: new row = original row + \"92892\". And note that \"92892\" is constant for all rows in the top half output.\n\nNow what about bottom half rows? They are 10 columns as well. They don't seem to be just input rows appended with something, because input only had 5 rows. So maybe the bottom half rows are generated by taking the corresponding row", "prompt_tokens": 552, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check.\nMapping: In input, there is a region that has 4's and 5's. And outside that region, it's zeros. In output, that region seems to be transformed: The outside area becomes \"5\" maybe.\nWait, let's compare:\nInput has rows 3-10 with non-zero digits. In output, rows 1-12 have nonzero digits except row 13. In output, the top and bottom rows of the non-black region become 5's. And inside the region, the pattern has been inverted maybe?\nWait, let's examine row3: Input row3: \"0044444440000000000\". Output row3: \"5544444445500000000\". So the transformation is: The leftmost two digits: originally \"00\", become \"55\". And the rightmost part of row3: originally \"0000000000\", become \"0000000000\"? Wait, but \"5500000000\" is the output.\nSimilarly, row4: \"0044444440000000000\" becomes \"5544444445500000000\". So it appears that the first two digits of the row become the new ones? But then row5: \"0044555440000000000\" becomes \"5544555445500000000\". So the pattern is: The first two digits become \"55\", and the last two digits become \"55\". In fact, check row6: \"0044555440000000000\" becomes \"5544555445500000000\". So essentially, the region is extended by adding a border of \"5\"s around the region.\nCheck row9: \"0044444440000000000\" becomes \"5544444445500000000\". So, transformation appears to be: Find the \"active\" region in input that is nonzero (specifically, the region with digits \"4\" and \"5\") and then the output is the same region but with an extra border of 5's? But then look at row1 and row2 which are all zeros in input, become all 5's. And row11 and row12 become all 5's. And row13 remains zeros. So the transformation is: The region that is not zero in input is extended by one row and one column in each direction and then set to the maximum digit among the region? But wait, check the numbers: In input, the region is 4 and 5, but output is 5 everywhere in the extended region. But then in E.g. 2, input digits: There is region with \"3\"s and \"1\" inside? Let's check E.g. 2: \nInput:\nRows:\nRow1: 00000000000000 (14 zeros?) Actually counts columns: \"00000000000000\" length? Let's see: It says \"00000000000000\" (maybe 14 columns?) but then later row4: \"00033333000000\" (14 columns?) Actually count digits: \"00033333000000\" has 14 characters? Let's count: 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. Yes.\nOutput:\nRow1: 00000000000000 (unchanged)\nRow2: 00000000000000 (unchanged)\nRow3: 00111111100000 (so row3 got border from row4? Possibly border of 1's? Wait, row3 originally is all zeros, but then output row3 becomes \"00111111100000\".)\nRow4: \"00133333100000\" from input row4 \"00033333000000\" becomes \"00133333100000\".\nRow5: \"00133333100000\" from input row5 same as row4? Actually input row5: \"00033133000000\", output row5: \"00133133100000\". Wait, check: E.g. 2 input rows:\nRow3: 00000000000000\nRow4: 00033333000000\nRow5: 00033333000000\nRow6: 00033133000000\nRow7: 00033333000000\nRow8: 00033333000000\nRow9: 00000000000000.\nOutput rows:\nRow1: 00000000000000 (unchanged)\nRow2: 00000000000000 (unchanged)\nRow3: 00111111100000\nRow4: 00133333100000\nRow5: 00133333100000\nRow6: 00133133100000\nRow7: 00133333100000\nRow8: 00133333100000\nRow9: 00111111100000\nRow10:00000000000000\nRow11:00000000000000\nRow12:00000000000000\nRow13:00000000000000.\n\nObserving: The transformation seems to add a border around the region of interest, but the border digit is the digit from the region's edge? In E.g. 1, the border digit is \"5\" (the maximum digit in the region maybe?) In E.g. 2, the region had digits \"3\" and \"1\". The border added is \"1\" on the top and bottom rows? Wait, check: In output, row3 becomes \"00111111100000\". The region in input row4 and row5 are \"33333\" in the middle. But output row3 becomes \"11111\" in the middle. And row9 is \"11111\". And rows 4-8 become \"1333331\". So maybe the rule is: Identify contiguous region of nonzero numbers, then replace all nonzero digits with the minimum nonzero digit among them? But then look at E.g. 3:\nInput E.g. 3:\nRows:\nRow1: 00000000000000\nRow2: 00000000000000\nRow3: 00000000000000\nRow4: 00066660000000\nRow5: 00064460000000\nRow6: 00064460000000\nRow7: 00066660000000\nRow8: 00000000000000\nRow9: 00000000000000\nRow10:00000000000000\nRow11:00000000000000\nRow12:00000000000000\nRow13:00000000000000\nRow14:00000000000000\nRow15:00000000000000\nRow16:00000000000000\n\nOutput E.g. 3:\nRow1: 00000000000000\nRow2: 04444444400000\nRow3: 04444444400000\nRow4: 04466664400000\nRow5: 04464464400000\nRow6: 04464464400000\nRow7: 04466664400000\nRow8: 04444444400000\nRow9: 04444444400000\nRow10:00000000000000\nRow11:00000000000000\nRow12:00000000000000\nRow13:00000000000000\nRow14:00000000000000\nRow15:00000000000000\nRow16:00000000000000\n\nObserving: In input, the region is rows 4-7 and columns maybe 4 to 9? Actually, count columns: In row4 input: \"00066660000000\" (length 16?) Actually, \"00066660000000\" count digits: 0,0,0,6,6,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 -> 14 digits?

But note: E.g. 1 output grid is:\nRow1: \"100\"\nRow2: \"010\"\nRow3: \"000\"\nSo shape: 3 rows, 3 columns. E.g. 2 output grid: 3 rows, 3 columns. E.g. 3 output grid: 3 rows, 3 columns (\"100\", \"010\", \"001\"). E.g. 4 output grid: 3 rows, 3 columns. E.g. 5 output grid: 3 rows, 3 columns.\n\nSo one pattern: The output grid is always 3 cells by 3 cells. And the transformation seems to highlight some \"diagonal\" pattern? For instance, E.g. 1: output grid: top row: 1,0,0; middle row: 0,1,0; bottom row: 0,0,0. E.g. 3: output grid: 1,0,0; 0,1,0; 0,0,1. E.g. 2: output grid: 1,0,0; then two rows 0,0,0. E.g. 4: output grid: 1,0,0; 0,1,0; 0,0,0. E.g. 5: output grid: 1,0,0; 0,0,0; 0,0,0.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: find the \"center\" of the input grid, or perhaps \"diagonal\" of some subgrid. But careful: The input grids are not all the same shape. Let's list them along with shape and output.\n\nExample 1: Input shape: 7 rows, 7 columns? Actually, check that: \"2203003\" is 7 digits, \"2202200\" 7 digits, \"0002200\" 7 digits, \"2330022\" 7 digits, \"0330022\" 7 digits, \"0000330\" 7 digits, \"3020330\" 7 digits. So input is 7x7. Output is 3x3.\n\nE.g. 2: Input: rows: \"03300\" row length = 5, second row \"03300\", third \"00000\", fourth \"22002\", fifth \"22000\", sixth \"00022\", seventh \"00022\". So input is 7 rows, 5 columns. Output is 3x3.\n\nE.g. 3: Input: rows: \"0033000\" (7 columns), \"2033030\" (7 columns), \"0000000\", \"3300220\", \"3300220\", \"0033000\", \"0033000\". So 7x7 input, output is 3x3.\n\nE.g. 4: Input: rows: \"0330003\" (7 columns), \"0330000\" (7 columns), \"0000200\" (7 columns), \"3000330\" (7 columns), \"0030330\" (7 columns). So input is 5x7, output is 3x3.\n\nE.g. 5: Input: rows: \"00022\" (5 columns), \"33022\" (5 columns), \"33000\"(5 columns), \"00220\" (5 columns), \"30220\" (5 columns). So input is 5x5, output is 3x3.\n\nTest Input: rows: \"00000\" (5 columns), \"03300\" (5 columns), \"03300\" (5 columns), \"20000\" (5 columns), \"00003\" (5 columns), \"33000\" (5 columns), \"33022\" (5 columns), \"00022\" (5 columns). So test input is 8 rows, 5 columns.\n\nObservation: Output is always 3x3. So the transformation extracts a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid, but which 3x3 region? Possibly the top-left 3x3? But check example 1: if we take top-left 3x3 from 7x7 input, that would be:\nRow1: \"2203\"? That doesn't match output \"100\". So not that.\n\nMaybe it's the \"diagonal\" of something? Look at E.g. 1 output: It has \"100\" in row1, \"010\" in row2, and \"000\" in row3. How to obtain that from input? Perhaps it's taking the \"diagonal\" of the input matrix? But the input matrix is 7x7. If we take the main diagonal of the 7x7, that would be: positions (0,0)=2, (1,1)=2, (2,2)=0, (3,3)=0, (4,4)=0, (5,5)=3, (6,6)=0. That doesn't match.\n\nMaybe it's summing along diagonals? Let me check: For E.g. 1, output \"100\", \"010\", \"000\". Possibly the transformation is: find the \"path\" from top-left to bottom-right that is \"active\" somehow? Alternatively, maybe it's \"connect the centers\" of the numbers in the input grid. Possibly the transformation is: find the positions of a certain digit (maybe 2 or 3) and then highlight them in the output grid in some order.\n\nLet's look at E.g. 1 input: \"2203003\" etc. Check the digits in input: They are digits 0,2,3. In output, there are 1's and 0's. Possibly the transformation is: if a cell in the input grid is not 0, then mark something in the output grid. But then E.g. 1 output: row1: \"100\", row2: \"010\", row3: \"000\". That means there are three non-zero outputs? But in input, there are many non-zero digits. So not that.\n\nMaybe it's about connectivity. Look at E.g. 1: output has a diagonal from top-left to center. E.g. 3: output: \"100\", \"010\", \"001\", i.e. diagonal from top-left to bottom-right. E.g. 2: output: \"100\", \"000\", \"000\", so only top-left. E.g. 4: output: \"100\", \"010\", \"000\", so like E.g. 1. E.g. 5: output: \"100\", \"000\", \"000\", like E.g. 2.\n\nMaybe the transformation is: from the input grid, find the positions of some particular digit, then take the convex hull? Possibly the transformation is to \"shrink\" the input grid to a smaller grid by some rule. The output grid is always 3x3. Perhaps the rule is: crop the input grid to only include rows that contain a certain pattern or digit? For example, E.g. 1: input is 7x7. Which rows contributed to the output? The output rows indices: maybe row1 of output corresponds to rows 2, 3, 4 of input? Because output has 3 rows, input has 7 rows. Similarly, columns: input 7 columns, output 3 columns. So maybe we are taking the central 3 rows and central 3 columns of the input grid for some examples? Let's check: For E.g. 1: central 3 rows of 7 would be rows index 2,3,4 (if indexing 0-based, middle row is 3, so rows 2,3,4) and central 3 columns would be columns 2,3,4. Let's check that: E.g. 1, row2 (0-indexed row 2 is \"0002200\", columns 2,3,4 are \"022\") not equal to \"100\". Alternatively, maybe it's not the central region.\n\nMaybe it's the \"corner\" region? For E.g. 1, if we take top-left 3x3, that is rows 0-2 and columns 0-2: That gives:\nRow0: \"220\" (but output row0 is \"100", "prompt_tokens": 615, "completion_tokens": 2048}

{"task_id": "3d31c5b3", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus:free", "raw_response": "We are given several pairs of example inputs and outputs. They said: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" The examples are given as e.g. 1, e.g. 2, etc.\n\nWe are given several examples. Let's list them with details:\n\nWe have several examples: E.g. 1 Input and Output.\nE.g. 1 Input:\n```\n055550\n550555\n550500\n004000\n404440\n400000\n202202\n200002\n000200\n080800\n080000\n080800\n```\nE.g. 1 Output:\n```\n255552\n554555\n550500\n```\nWait careful: There are 12 lines of input, but only 3 lines output? How many rows? Possibly each example input is a 3x? or structured differently? Let's re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"provided input/output examples\" They represent a hidden transformation rule. Example 1: \n- Input: (lines provided) \n- Output: (lines provided)\n\nWait check: Example 1 input is given as:\n```\n055550\n550555\n550500\n004000\n404440\n400000\n202202\n200002\n000200\n080800\n080000\n080800\n```\nBut then output is:\n```\n255552\n554555\n550500\n```\nSo input has 12 rows whereas output has 3 rows. Similarly, example 2: \nInput:\n```\n550555\n050505\n000550\n044040\n000004\n040404\n222000\n022020\n222020\n808888\n008888\n000800\n```\nOutput:\n```\n554555\n058585\n242554\n```\nSo input has 12 rows, output has 3 rows.\n\nWait, then example 3:\nInput:\n```\n505000\n005005\n505050\n000404\n000400\n400404\n002002\n220220\n220002\n880888\n888880\n880000\n```\nOutput:\n```\n585484\n885485\n585454\n```\nAgain same pattern: 12 input rows, 3 output rows.\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n```\n555500\n055055\n055555\n444044\n000440\n444040\n202200\n220200\n222020\n008088\n888000\n080080\n```\nOutput:\n```\n555544\n855455\n455555\n```\nExample 5:\nInput:\n```\n500000\n050005\n005550\n440444\n000440\n404400\n202202\n220220\n000002\n888808\n000880\n000888\n```\nOutput:\n```\n548444\n250445\n405558\n```\nExample 6:\nInput:\n```\n050550\n050555\n550555\n400044\n000440\n404004\n022220\n222020\n020200\n800808\n800080\n800800\n```\nOutput:\n```\n452554\n852555\n554555\n```\nTest Input:\n```\n505005\n050005\n555000\n000404\n000000\n400400\n202022\n220222\n222222\n008800\n080088\n000800\n```\n\nObserving pattern: In each example, input is 12-digit rows? Actually let's check number of columns: In example 1, the input lines appear to be strings of digits. For instance, first line \"055550\" has length 6. Second line \"550555\" is length 6. Third line \"550500\" is length 6. Fourth line \"004000\" is length 6. Fifth \"404440\" is length 6. Sixth \"400000\" length 6. Seventh \"202202\" length 6. Eighth \"200002\" length 6. Ninth \"000200\" length 6. Tenth \"080800\" length 6. Eleventh \"080000\" length 6. Twelfth \"080800\" length 6.\n\nSo input is 12 rows, each row 6 digits. But output in example 1 is 3 rows, each 6 digits. So it seems transformation takes a 12x6 grid and outputs a 3x6 grid. Let's check e.g. 2: Input lines length? \"550555\" length 6, etc. So transformation rule: From input grid of 12 rows, produce output grid of 3 rows. Likely each output row is some combination of rows from the input? Possibly the transformation is like \"mirror\" or \"merge\" rows? Let's try to see a relation between input rows and output rows.\n\nLook at Example 1:\nInput rows index: I'll denote them as row 0 to 11.\nOutput rows: There are 3 output rows. Possibly each output row is the result of processing a block of 4 rows? Because 12/3 = 4. Let's see: Maybe output row 0 is built from input rows 0,1,2,3? Output row 1 from 4,5,6,7? Output row 2 from 8,9,10,11? Let\u2019s test that hypothesis.\n\nFor Example 1, group rows (0-3), (4-7), (8-11) and see if that produces output rows.\n\nGroup 0-3:\nRow0: 0 5 5 5 5 0\nRow1: 5 5 0 5 5 5\nRow2: 5 5 0 5 0 0?\nWait row2: \"550500\" digits: 5,5,0,5,0,0.\nRow3: \"004000\": digits: 0,0,4,0,0,0\n\nWe want output row 0 = \"255552\". Compare group: Possibly each column is computed from the four rows?\nLet's check columns: For column 0, group digits: row0:0, row1:5, row2:5, row3:0. Output digit is 2. For column 1: digits: 5,5,5,0. Output digit is 5. Column 2: digits: 5,0,0,4. Output digit is 5? Actually output col2 is \"5\"? Actually output row 0 \"255552\": digits: 2,5,5,5,5,2.\nLet's check column 3: digits: row0:5, row1:5, row2:5, row3:0, output is 5. Column 4: digits: row0:5, row1:5, row2:0, row3:0, output is 5. Column 5: digits: row0:0, row1:5, row2:0, row3:0, output is 2.\nMaybe rule: The output digit in each column is the sum of the digits in that column mod something? Let's test: For column 0, sum=0+5+5+0=10, mod? But output is 2, not 10 mod something. Perhaps it's median? Or maybe it's the maximum digit? Let's see: For col0: max digit is 5, but output is 2. Maybe it's the difference between count of something?\nMaybe rule: Replace each cell with a value that is determined by the pattern of black and white squares? But digits are not binary? They are 0,4,5, etc. Wait, let's check other examples.\n\nMaybe each input grid is 12 rows of a 6x6 grid? And output is 3 rows. It may be like \"compress\" the input grid vertically by factor 4? Perhaps the rule is: The output grid's cell at (row, col) equals the digit that appears most frequently in the corresponding block of 4 input rows? Let's test that idea.\n\nFor example 1, group rows 0-3, column 0: digits: [0, 5, 5, 0]. Frequency: 0 appears 2 times, 5 appears 2 times. But output is 2, not 5. So maybe it's not majority but maybe it's sum mod something. Let's try sum of digits in the block and then take mod something.\n\nFor group 0-3, column0: sum=0+5+5+0 = 10. But output digit is 2. 10 mod ? 10 mod 8 = 2? But 10 mod 8 equals 2. Let's test column1: digits: 5,5,5,0 => sum = 15, 15 mod 8 = 7, but output is 5. No.\n\nMaybe it's difference between sum of first two rows and last two rows? For group 0-3, maybe output digit = (first two rows sum - last two rows sum) mod something? Let's test: For column0: first two rows: 0+5=5, last two: 5+0=5, difference=0, not 2.\n\nMaybe it's like: output digit = (first row digit + last row digit)? For col0: 0+0=0, not 2. Maybe it's the average of the four digits (rounded)? For col0: average = (0+5+5+0)/4 = 10/4 = 2.5, rounding to nearest integer maybe 2 or 3? But then col1: average = (5+5+5+0)/4 =15/4=3.75,", "prompt_tokens": 769, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The transformation rule might be: probably the output is generated by \"filling the holes\" or \"transforming\" shapes.\n\nLet's rest the example 1 details:\n\nE.g. 1 Input (grid lines):\n- Row: \"333333333333333333333333333333\"  (line1)\n- Row: \"331111333333333333333333333333\"  (line2)\n- Row: \"331881333332223333333333333333\"  (line3)\n- Row: \"331881333332423333333333333333\"  (line4)\n- Row: \"331111333332223333333333333333\"  (line5)\n- Row: \"333333333333333333333333333333\"  (line6)\n- Row: \"333333333333333333333333333333\"  (line7)\n\nThen a series of rows:\n- \"000000000000000000000000000000\"  (line8)\n- \"000000001110000000000000000000\"  (line9)\n- \"000000001110000000000000000000\"  (line10)\n- \"000000001110000000000022200000\"  (line11)\n- \"000000000000088000000022200000\"  (line12)\n- \"000880000000088000000022200000\"  (line13)\n- \"000880000000000000000000000000\"  (line14)\n- \"000000000000000000000000880000\"  (line15)\n- \"000000000000000000000000880000\"  (line16)\n- \"044000000000000022200000000000\"  (line17)\n- \"044000000880000022200000000000\"  (line18)\n- \"000000000880000022200000000000\"  (line19)\n- \"000000000000000000000000000000\"  (line20)\n- \"000000000000000000000000440000\"  (line21)\n- \"000000000000000000000000440000\"  (line22)\n- \"000222000000000000000000000000\"  (line23)\n- \"000222000000440000000000000000\"  (line24)\n- \"000222000000440000000000000000\"  (line25)\n- \"000000000000000000880000000000\"  (line26)\n- \"000008800000000000880000000000\"  (line27)\n- \"000008800000000000000000011100\"  (line28)\n- \"000000000000000000000000011100\"  (line29)\n- \"000000000000000000000000011100\"  (line30)\n\nE.g. 1 Output is slightly different. Let's compare line by line:\nLine1 output: \"333333333333333333333333333333\" same as input.\nLine2 output: \"331111333333333333333333333333\" same as input.\nLine3 output: \"331881333332223333333333333333\" same as input.\nLine4 output: \"331881333332423333333333333333\" same as input.\nLine5 output: \"331111333332223333333333333333\" same as input.\nLine6 output: \"333333333333333333333333333333\" same as input.\nLine7 output: \"333333333333333333333333333333\" same as input.\n\nThen the next lines:\nLine8 output: \"000000000000000000000000000000\" same as input.\nLine9 output: \"000000001110000000000000000000\" same.\nLine10 output: \"000000001110000000000000000000\" same.\nLine11 output: \"000000001110111100000022200000\". The input had \"000000001110000000000022200000\". So difference: in col positions 16-20? Let's check: \"11100\" appears in output. So maybe the transformation rule is \"filling\" the shapes with a pattern maybe.\nLine12 output: \"001111000000188100000024200000\" vs input \"000000000000088000000022200000\".\nSo the transformation rule seems to modify the lower right part of the grid. It seems like the transformation rule is to \"rotate\" or \"translate\" subgrids? Let's look carefully.\n\nObserving the differences in rows 8 to 30 (the bottom part) for example 1:\n\nInput lower part rows:\nRow8: \"000000000000000000000000000000\"\nRow9: \"000000001110000000000000000000\"\nRow10: \"000000001110000000000000000000\"\nRow11: \"000000001110000000000022200000\"\nRow12: \"000000000000088000000022200000\"\nRow13: \"000880000000088000000022200000\"\nRow14: \"000880000000000000000000000000\"\nRow15: \"000000000000000000000000880000\"\nRow16: \"000000000000000000000000880000\"\nRow17: \"044000000000000022200000000000\"\nRow18: \"044000000880000022200000000000\"\nRow19: \"000000000880000022200000000000\"\nRow20: \"000000000000000000000000000000\"\nRow21: \"000000000000000000000000440000\"\nRow22: \"000000000000000000000000440000\"\nRow23: \"000222000000000000000000000000\"\nRow24: \"000222000000440000000000000000\"\nRow25: \"000222000000440000000000000000\"\nRow26: \"000000000000000000880000000000\"\nRow27: \"000008800000000000880000000000\"\nRow28: \"000008800000000000000000011100\"\nRow29: \"000000000000000000000000011100\"\nRow30: \"000000000000000000000000011100\"\n\nOutput lower part rows:\nRow8: same.\nRow9: same.\nRow10: same.\nRow11: \"000000001110111100000022200000\" -> We see that \"11100\" was inserted in place of \"00000\". So maybe the transformation rule is \"mirror\" or \"rotate\" the shape in the block from row9-col? Let's compare further rows.\n\nRow12 input: \"000000000000088000000022200000\", output: \"001111000000188100000024200000\". How to get that transformation?\n- It seems like the transformation rule might be \"flip\" or \"reflect\" some region along the diagonal maybe, increasing the digits by 1 in some positions?\n\nLet's try to compare differences between input and output:\n\nObserving row 11:\n- At col positions from 16 to 20 in input, they are \"00000\". In output they are \"11100\". So it seems numbers \"1\" replaced some zeros.\nRow12:\n- In input row12: \"000000000000088000000022200000\". In output row12: \"001111000000188100000024200000\".\nLet's align columns: \n  Input row12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0,0,0]\n  Output row12: [0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,2,0,0,0,?]\nWait, count carefully: The output row12 as given: \"001111000000188100000024200000\". Count digits: 32 digits. The input row12 \"000000000000088000000022200000\" is also 32 digits? Let's count: \"000000000000088000000022200000\" length: 32? Let's count: \"000000000000\" is 12, \"088\" is 3, \"000000\" is 6, \"022200000\" is 9", "prompt_tokens": 2731, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check: The row 5 (0-indexed counting from 0, but maybe 1-indexed?) but the provided input likely is not entirely symmetrical. Let's re-read carefully:\n\nE.g. 1 Input: There's a grid of 25 rows (but I see more than 25, maybe 25 rows, but I'll count manually the rows with non-zero digits:\n- Row 5: \"00022222000000000000000000000\" contains a block \"22222\" (I see \"22222\" from index 3 to index 7?)

Nonzero digits appear in row5: block \"22222\" and row12: block \"33333\". Their positions seem to be centered in the grid. The output grid in E.g. 1 is a 5x5 grid:\nE.g. 1 Output:\n22222\n23332\n23832\n23332\n22222\n\nObserving pattern: The transformation rule likely takes two connected shapes from the input and then creates a \"border\" around them? Wait, analyze: In the output, we see a plus shape pattern. Actually, the output is a 5x5 square with outer boundary digits 2 and inner digits 3 except the center replaced with 8. But wait, the pattern: Row1: \"22222\"\nRow2: \"23332\"\nRow3: \"23832\"\nRow4: \"23332\"\nRow5: \"22222\"\n\nSo the output is a diamond shape? Not exactly. Let\u2019s try to see pattern: The digits \"2\" and \"3\" and \"8\". The digits in the input were \"2\" and \"3\" (and maybe also something else). Possibly the rule is: find two foci in the input grid (the two \"active\" clusters, one with value 2 and one with value 3). Then, draw concentric circles around them (or rectangles) with increasing digit values until they meet, and then fill the overlapping region with the sum or maximum of the two values? Wait, let's analyze further.\n\nLook at E.g. 2: Input grid:\nIt has a block of \"1\" digit? Actually, E.g. 2 Input:\n```\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000100000000\n0000300000000100000000\n0000300000000100000000\n0000300000000100000000\n0000300000000100000000\n0000000000000100000000\n0000000060000000000000\n0000000060000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000\n```\nNonzero digits: There's a \"1\" in row 3, column? Let's count columns: Each row has 20 columns? Actually, row 3: \"0000000000000100000000\". So digit '1' is at column index 13 maybe. And then there is a block of \"3\" digits at row 4, row 5, row 6, row 7? Let's check:\nRow 4: \"0000300000000100000000\" contains \"3\" at column 4 maybe and \"1\" at column 13.\nRow 5: \"0000300000000100000000\" similar.\nRow 6: \"0000300000000100000000\" similar.\nRow 7: \"0000300000000100000000\" similar.\nThen row 9: \"0000000060000000000000\" has \"6\" at column index? \"0000000060000000000000\" -> \"6\" appears at column 7 maybe, then \"0000000060000000000000\" row 10: same pattern.\nSo we have three distinct digits: 1, 3, and 6. And the output grid for E.g. 2 is:\n```\n111111\n133331\n136631\n136631\n133331\n111111\n``", "prompt_tokens": 1309, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Actually, \"0003000000000000\" means: characters: index0: '0', index1: '0', index2: '0', index3: '3', then zeros. So there is a '3' in row 11, col 3.

That is 16 lines. But then what is \"0000000000030000\"? It may be a misprint? Let's re-read the provided problem statement carefully:\n\nIt says: \"E.g. 1 Input:\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0003000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\"\n\nWait, but then after that, it shows \"E.g. 1 Output:\" then grid lines:\n\"0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000005555500\n0000000002050200\n0000000002030200\n0000000002000200\n2222222228888822\n0000000000000000\n0555550000000000\n0205020000000000\n0203020000000000\n0200020000000000\n2888882222222222\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\"\n\nSo what's going on? The outputs seem to have two \"spikes\" of pattern: In output, rows 3,4,5,6 have pattern \"5555500\" or \"2050200\" etc. And rows 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 are different. Let\u2019s look at E.g. 1 output rows with non-zero digits: row 3: \"0000000005555500\" and row 4: \"0000000002050200\", row 5: \"0000000002030200\", row 6: \"0000000002000200\". Then row 7: \"2222222228888822\". Then row 9: \"0555550000000000\", row 10: \"0205020000000000\", row 11: \"0203020000000000\", row 12: \"0200020000000000\". Then row 13: \"2888882222222222\".\n\nThis is interesting. It might be that the transformation rule is to detect certain \"seed\" cells and then fill out a pattern based on distance from seeds? It appears that there are two seeds. In E.g.1 input, the only nonzero digit", "prompt_tokens": 867, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Our job: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" The examples are numeric grids. The transformation rule is hidden. We need to deduce transformation rule from provided examples.\n\nWe have three examples. Let's label them:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput grid: there is a 34 x 34? Actually, let's check dimensions. The grid lines all seem to be of length 30? Actually, count digits:\nLines: All are 30-digit lines? Check first line: \"000000000000000000000000000000\" is 30 digits? Actually, count: \"000000000000000000000000000000\" - count digits: 30? Let's count: groups of zeros \"000\" appended, but I'll count: Actually, let me count: \"000\" is 3 zeros, but then \"000\" is 3 zeros. Let's count properly:\nLine1: \"000000000000000000000000000000\". The count: maybe we can count groups: There are 30 digits? Actually, let's count manually: The first example input grid has 16 lines. They appear to be 30-digit strings, maybe 30 columns? Let's check: The grid in example 1 input: The first line: \"000000000000000000000000000000\" I'll count manually: \"000\" (3 zeros) then \"000\" (3) then \"000\" (3) then \"000\" (3) then \"000\" (3?) Let me count precisely: The text \"000000000000000000000000000000\". I'll count groups of 3: \"000\" repeated 10 times equals 30 digits.

Let's check carefully:\nInput line19: \"000000000000003333333333333330\"\nI see:\n- The first 15 characters are zeros: \"000000000000000\" maybe? Let's count: Actually, \"000000000000000\" is 15 zeros? Actually, count: \"000000000000000\" is 15 zeros, but here we need to check the exact string.\n\nI see: \"000000000000003333333333333330\". It looks like there are some zeros, then digits \"3333\" then \"333333333330\". But output: \"000000000000003344444444444330\".\n\nSo comparing:\nInput:  ... \"000000000000003333333333333330\"\nOutput: ... \"000000000000003344444444444330\"\nSo it seems that the transformation rule in the bottom block changed something: It might be a \"flip\" of a central section. Wait, check line20:\nInput line20: \"000000000000003333333333333330\"\nOutput line20: \"000000000000003344444444444330\"\nSo both changed similarly.\n\nLine21: Input: \"000000000000003333333333333", "prompt_tokens": 2665, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The problem description mentions that we have several examples with input/output pairs. We are provided with E.g. 1, E.g. 2, and E.g. 3 sample input and output. And then there is a final test input grid given. We need to determine transformation rule from the examples and then apply it to the final test input grid to produce final output grid in JSON list of lists.\n\nLet's re-read the provided examples carefully.\n\nWe have three examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nLine 1: \"0000000000000000000000\"\nLine 2: \"0000002000000000000000\"\nLine 3: \"0020002320000000000000\"\nLine 4: \"0272000020000000000000\"\nLine 5: \"0020000000000000000000\"\nLine 6: \"0000020000111111111110\"\nLine 7: \"0000242000111111111110\"\nLine 8: \"0000022000111111113110\"\nLine 9: \"0000000000111111111110\"\nLine 10:\"0222000000111111111110\"\nLine 11:\"0282000000111141111110\"\nLine 12:\"0202000000111111111110\"\nLine 13:\"0000000000111111111110\"\nLine 14:\"0000000000111111111110\"\nLine 15:\"0000000000118111171110\"\nLine 16:\"0000000000111111111110\"\nLine 17:\"0000000000111111111110\"\nLine 18:\"0000000000000000000000\"\n\nOutput:\nLine 1: \"11111111111\"\nLine 2: \"11111112111\"\nLine 3: \"11111112321\"\nLine 4: \"11111111121\"\nLine 5: \"11112111111\"\nLine 6: \"11124211111\"\nLine 7: \"11112211111\"\nLine 8: \"11111111111\"\nLine 9: \"12221112111\"\nLine 10:\"12821127211\"\nLine 11:\"12121112111\"\nLine 12:\"11111111111\"\n\nWait, wait, I must check: The number of lines in output is not equal to input lines? Let's re-read provided E.g. 1 Input and Output carefully. It says \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then many lines. Then \"E.g. 1 Output:\" then many lines. Let me count: E.g. 1 Input has 18 lines, but E.g. 1 Output has 12 lines. It seems the output is a different shape than input. Similarly, E.g. 2 Input: 16 lines but E.g. 2 Output: 9 lines. E.g. 3 Input: 18 lines, E.g. 3 Output: 6 lines.\n\nSo apparently each transformation rule reduces the grid in some particular manner. The transformation might be something like: \"Find connected shapes and transform them, or maybe count something.\"\n\nWait, let's re-read E.g. 1: Input grid is 18 rows by 20 columns (since first line \"0000...0\" is 20 zeros). Output grid is 12 rows by 11 columns (first output line \"11111111111\" is 11 digits) So what changed? Possibly the rule is extraction of a pattern from the input grid. Possibly we are reading the \"non-zero\" parts? But then the output has many \"1\" digits, and a few others like \"2\" and \"3\". In fact, in E.g.1 output, all digits are nonzero except some zeros replaced by ones? Wait, let's check: E.g.1 output first row: \"11111111111\" which are all 1's. The input first row had all 0's. So transformation rule is not simply copying nonzero values.\n\nI need to examine the patterns. Possibly the rule is: \"rotate or mirror the grid\", or \"extract a sub-grid defined by bounding boxes of nonzero digits\". Let\u2019s analyze E.g.1 input: It has a few nonzero digits: \nRow2: \"0000002000000000000000\" has a \"2\" in column? Let's count columns: row2, 7th? Actually, let's count: string \"0000002000000000000000\": if indexing from 1, then the first 6 characters are 0, then 2, then zeros. So that is a \"2\" in column 7. Row3: \"0020002320000000000000\": that has a \"2\" at column 3? Actually, let's note: \"0020002320000000000000\". It seems to have pattern: \"00\" then \"2000\" then \"232\" then \"00000\". Not sure.\n\nMaybe a better idea: Look at E.g.1 output: It has digits 1,2,3. They might represent a sort of ordering of the numbers in the input? For instance, in E.g.1 input we see \"2\", \"3\", \"2\", \"7\", \"2\", etc. In output, there's \"1\", \"2\", \"3\" and also \"8\" in one instance \"12821127211\" appears. Wait, in E.g.1 output row 10 is \"12821127211\". That row contains \"8\". Where did that come from? In E.g.1 input, row 10 is \"0222000000111141111110\" which contains digits 0,2,2,2, etc. It also has \"1\" and \"1\" at the end. Possibly the transformation rule is \"replace each digit with the number of times it appears in some pattern\" or \"some sort of morphological operation\".\n\nMaybe we should look at E.g.2 and E.g.3. Let's inspect E.g.2:\nInput:\nLine1: \"00000000000000000000\" (20 zeros)\nLine2: \"00000000000000000000\"\nLine3: \"00000000000200000000\"\nLine4: \"00000000002120000000\"\nLine5: \"00000000002000002020\"\nLine6: \"00000000000000000320\"\nLine7: \"08888880000000002020\"\nLine8: \"08888880000000000000\"\nLine9: \"08188880000000000000\"\nLine10:\"08888880000202000000\"\nLine11:\"08888880000042000000\"\nLine12:\"08888880000222000000\"\nLine13:\"08888880000000000000\"\nLine14:\"08884880000000000000\"\nLine15:\"08888880000000000000\"\nLine16:\"00000000000000000000\"\n\nOutput:\nLine1: \"888888\"\nLine2: \"828888\"\nLine3: \"212888\"\nLine4: \"288888\"\nLine5: \"888888\"\nLine6: \"888888\"\nLine7: \"882828\"\nLine8: \"888428\"\nLine9: \"882228\"\n\nSo E.g.2 input has many rows containing \"0\" and some containing \"2\", \"8\", etc. The output is a much smaller grid (9 rows x 6 columns). The digits in output are \"8\", \"2\", \"1\". They are among the digits that appear in the input? In input, we see \"0\", \"2\", \"8\", and \"4\" sometimes. But output digits are 8,2,1. In E.g.2, I see \"1\" appears only in output row2: \"828888\" no, row2: \"828888\" no 1? Wait, let me re-read E.g.2 output:\nRow1: \"888888\" (all 8's)\nRow2: \"828888\" (one 2 then 8's)\nRow3: \"212888\"\nRow4: \"288888\"\nRow5: \"888888\"\nRow6: \"888888\"\nRow7: \"882828\"\nRow8: \"888428\"\nRow9: \"882228\"\nSo digits: we see 8, 2, and 1 appear. Where does \"1\" come from? Possibly \"1\" is the count of something? Or maybe \"1\" is a transformed placeholder for \"0\"? But then in E.g.1, output has \"1\" everywhere except some digits become 2 or 3. In E.g.3: Output digits are \"3\", \"2\", \"1\" sometimes. In E.g.3 output:\nRow1: \"333332223333\"\nRow2: \"333333433333\"\nRow3: \"333332223333\"\nRow4: \"321233332233\"\nRow5: \"332333332833\"\nRow6: \"333333333323\"\nDigits: They are 1,2,3,4 maybe? Actually row4: \"321233332233\" has digits 3,2,1,2,3,3,3,3,2,2,3,3. So digits 1,2,3 appear; also row2 has \"4333\" part, so digit 4 appears. And row5 has \"332333332833\" with digit 8 also? Wait, check row5: \"332333332833\" digits: 3,3,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,8,3,3. So digit 8 appears. And row6: \"333333333323\" has digits", "prompt_tokens": 1174, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Task: deduce the transformation rule from the examples and then apply to the test input grid.\n\nObserving examples:\n\nE.g. 1: Input grid:\nRow structure: \nRow 1: 00000000000\nRow 2: 00000000000\nRow 3: 00888880000\nRow 4: 00800080000\nRow 5: 00800080000\nRow 6: 00800080000\nRow 7: 00888880000\nRow 8: 00000000000\nRow 9: 00000000000\nRow 10: 00000000000\n\nOutput:\nRow 1: 00000000000\nRow 2: 00000000000\nRow 3: 88800000000\nRow 4: 00080000000\nRow 5: 80008000000\nRow 6: 08000800000\nRow 7: 00888880000\nRow 8: 00000000000\nRow 9: 00000000000\nRow 10: 00000000000\n\nObserving transformation: It appears the transformation rule is \"rotate by 90 degrees\" or \"flip\" something? Wait, let's compare input and output. In example 1, the input has an \"L\" shape pattern maybe.\n\nLet's look at coordinates. The input grid is 10x10.\nCoordinates: Let top-left be (row, col) with indices 0-based. The given pattern is symmetrical around center? Wait, let's analyze.\n\nInput:\nRow 3: 00888880000\nRow 4: 00800080000\nRow 5: 00800080000\nRow 6: 00800080000\nRow 7: 00888880000\n\nOutput:\nRow 3: 88800000000\nRow 4: 00080000000\nRow 5: 80008000000\nRow 6: 08000800000\nRow 7: 00888880000\n\nObservations: The output seems to be a kind of \"diagonal\" transformation. The top row of the pattern (row3 in input) becomes bottom row of pattern? Not exactly.\n\nLet's break it down: We see that the transformation is not a simple rotation. Compare row 3 in input: \"00888880000\". The output row 3 is \"88800000000\". So the left-most 2 digits \"00\" become replaced with \"888\"? Actually, check: \"00888880000\" vs \"88800000000\". They are different. How many digits? Possibly the transformation is \"reflect\" along the anti-diagonal? Let's analyze coordinates.\n\nObserving the structure: The pattern is symmetric along vertical or horizontal lines? Actually, look at input's position of non-zero digits: They are \"8\" digits, and \"0\" digits. In input, they are arranged in a square-like ring: row3 col2...? Wait, let's index columns: There are 10 columns. The pattern in row3: digits at columns 2 to 7 are 8? Actually, row3: \"00888880000\". That has 10 columns: index: 0:0, 1:0, 2:8,3:8,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8,8:0,9:0. Similarly row7: same pattern. And rows 4,5,6: \"00800080000\" i.e., 8 at col2 and col7, and 0's elsewhere. So input shape: It is a diamond shape rotated? Actually it's a square rotated 45 degrees? Let's check coordinates: The 8's in row3 are from col2 to col7. In row4, 8's at col2 and col7. In row5, same. In row6, same. In row7, same as row3.\nNow output: row3: \"88800000000\". That means row3 now has 8's in columns 0 to 2? Actually row3: \"88800000000\" means columns 0,1,2 are 8, then columns 3-9 are 0.\nRow4: \"00080000000\": one 8 at col3.\nRow5: \"80008000000\": one 8 at col0 and col? Actually \"80008000000\": col0=8, col? Let's recalc: row5: \"80008000000\" means first digit 8, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 8 then zeros. So positions: col0=8, col4=8?\nRow6: \"08000800000\": so col1=8 and col5=8.\nRow7: \"00888880000\": so col2=8, col3=8, col4=8, col5=8, col6=8, col7=8.\nLet's check pattern: The output pattern now is all 8's in a diagonal \"plus\" shape. Specifically, it appears that the transformation has taken the original pattern and \"rotated\" it 45 degrees clockwise? Let's check: Input had two horizontal thick segments at top and bottom, and then two narrow segments in the middle. Perhaps the transformation rule is to reflect the pattern along the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left). In other words, mapping (row, col) -> (col, row) maybe. But check with coordinates: In input, the 8's are at positions: (3,2) to (3,7), (4,2) and (4,7), (5,2) and (5,7), (6,2) and (6,7), (7,2) to (7,7). Now if we reflect along main diagonal (swap row and col), then what rows become? For example, (3,2) becomes (2,3) but output row2 is row index 2 with output \"00000000000\", so that doesn't match. What if we reflect along anti-diagonal? Reflection along anti-diagonal: mapping (r, c) -> (n-1-c, n-1-r) for grid of size n. For a 10x10 grid, mapping (r, c) -> (9-c, 9-r). Let's test: For input (3,2): becomes (9-2, 9-3) = (7,6). In output row7, col6 is 8? Let's check output row7: \"00888880000\", so col6=8, yes.\nTest another: (3,7) -> (9-7, 9-3) = (2,6). In output row2, col6: row2 \"88800000000\", col6 is 8? Wait, row2 \"88800000000\" means col0=8, col1=8, col2=8, col3=0, etc. But col6 is not 8. So anti-diagonal reflection doesn't match.\n\nMaybe it's a rotation by 90 degrees? Let's try rotation by 90 degrees clockwise: mapping (r, c) -> (c, n-1-r) for grid size n = 10. Let's test: For input (3,2): becomes (2, 10-1-3) = (2, 6). Row2 in output is \"88800000000\", so col6 is 8. Good.\nTest: (3,7): becomes (7, 10-1-3) = (7, 6). Row7 in output: \"00888880000\", col6=8. Good.\nTest: (4,2): becomes (2, 10-1-4) = (2, 5). Row2 \"88800000000\", col5=8? Actually row2 \"88800000000\" means col0,1,2 are 8. But col5 is not 8. So not rotation by 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nMaybe it's rotation by 90 degrees counterclockwise: mapping (r, c) -> (n-1-c, r). For input (3,2): becomes (10-1-2, 3) = (7, 3). Row7 in output is \"00888880000\", col3=8? Yes, because row7: col2=8, col3=8, col4=8, col5=8, col6=8, col7=8.\nTest: (3,7): becomes (10-1-7, 3) = (2, 3). Row2 \"88800000000\", col3=8? Actually row2 \"88800000000\" means first three are 8, so col3 is 8? Wait, row2 from example 1: \"88800000000\": col0=8, col1=8, col2=8, col3=0, oh no, col3 is 0. So that fails.\n\nMaybe it's a reflection along vertical axis? Let's try: Reflection along vertical axis: mapping (r, c) -> (r, n-1-c). For input (3,2): becomes (3, 10-1-2) = (3, 7). Row3 in output is \"88800000000\", col7= ? Actually row3 \"88800000000\": col0,1,", "prompt_tokens": 1023, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Example2: output grid size: 20x20. Example3: 25x20. Example4: 19x20.\n\nNow what transformation is happening? We see that the outer border rows (all zeros) remain unchanged? Let's check:\nExample1 input: outer border rows: row0 and row12 are \"0000000000000000000\". In output, row0 and row12 are same \"0000000000000000000\". Similarly, in example2, the first and last rows \"0000000000000000000\" remain unchanged. In example3, row1 and row25 are \"0000000000000000000\" remain unchanged. In example4, row1 and row19 remain unchanged. So transformation preserves the outer border rows: top and bottom rows remain same.\n\nNow look at interior rows. It seems that the transformation rule is applied only to some subgrid? Possibly the rule is symmetric with respect to some center columns. Observing example1: \nInput and output differ in only some rows: The difference in example1 output vs input: \nRow1: input \"0333330888880444440\", output same. \nRow2: input \"0300030800080404040\", output \"0300030800080404040\" same.\nRow3: input \"0300030800080444440\", output same.\nRow4: input \"0300030800080404040\", output same.\nRow5: input \"0333330888880444440\", output same.\nSo no differences in those rows? Wait, check: Actually, look at the lower part of example1. \nInput row7: \"0444440222220777770\". Output row7: \"0444440222220777770\" same.\nRow8: input \"0400040200020700070\". Output row8: \"0404040200020700070\": difference: at column positions? Let's index columns 0-indexed. \n\"0400040200020700070\": at columns: 0:0,1:4,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:4,6:2,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:2,11:7,12:0,13:0,14:7,15:0,16:0,17:70?

Let's re-read the examples:\n\nWe have three examples. Let's label them as E1, E2, E3, and then test input. The examples are given in text as lines, separated by newlines. The examples are similar, but with different dimensions.\n\nLet's re-read E1:\n\nE1 Input:\n```\n22202220222\n20202220202\n22202220222\n20202220202\n22202220222\n22202020202\n22202220222\n```\nE1 Output:\n```\n22202220222\n22202020202\n22202220222\n22202020202\n22202220222\n20202220202\n22202220222\n```\nSo E1 input and output: what changed? Let's compare row by row.\n\nE1 Input rows:\nRow0: 22202220222\nRow1: 20202220202\nRow2: 22202220222\nRow3: 20202220202\nRow4: 22202220222\nRow5: 22202020202\nRow6: 22202220222\n\nE1 Output rows:\nRow0: 22202220222\nRow1: 22202020202\nRow2: 22202220222\nRow3: 22202020202\nRow4: 22202220222\nRow5: 20202220202\nRow6: 22202220222\n\nSo what changed? Only row1 and row3 and row5? Let's check: The pattern of alternating rows? Let's compare row1: Input row1: \"20202220202\". Output row1: \"22202020202\". So the difference is that the first character changed from 2 to 2? Wait, let's check carefully: \"20202220202\" vs \"22202020202\". Maybe the second character changed? Let's compare positions:\nRow1: Input: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2\nRow1: Output: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\nWait, it's not exactly that. Let's compare character by character:\n\nFor row1:\nInput: 2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2\nOutput: 2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2\nLet's compare indices:\nIndex 0: both 2.\nIndex 1: input: 0, output: 2. So changed from 0 to 2.\nIndex 2: input: 2, output: 2. Fine.\nIndex 3: input: 0, output: 0? Actually no, compare row1's index 3: input has 0, output: 0? Wait, careful: They are both row1, but let's check: \"20202220202\" vs \"22202020202\". Actually, maybe I need to re-read:\nRow1 input: \"20202220202\"\nRow1 output: \"22202020202\"\nLet's index:\nIndex: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nInput: 2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2\nOutput: 2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2\n\nSo differences:\nAt index1: input 0 becomes output 2.\nAt index4: input 2 becomes output 2? Actually index4: input:2, output:2, so no.\nAt index5: input:2 becomes output:0, so index5 changed from 2 to 0.\nAt index6: input:2 becomes output:2, so no.\nAt index? Let's check index? \nLet's re-read: row1: input \"20202220202\". Let me re-read the entire row: Is it 11 characters? Count: \"20202220202\" is 11 characters maybe? But then row0 is 11 characters, so yes.\nWait, let's recalc: \"20202220202\" length: digits: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 equals 11 digits. And \"22202020202\" also 11 digits. So difference is index1 and index5? Let's check index1: input 0, output 2. Index5: input: digit at index5: In \"20202220202\", index: 0:2,1:0,2:2,3:0,4:2,5:2,6:2,7:0,8:2,9:0,10:2. And output \"22202020202\": index:0:2,1:2,2:2,3:0,4:2,5:0,6:2,7:0,8:2,9:0,10:2. So differences: index1: changed from 0 to 2, index5: changed from 2 to 0. But then row1 output becomes \"22202020202\". So what transformation is applied? Possibly toggling certain cells? Possibly swapping values if they are in a specific pattern? Let's check row3 input vs output in E1:\nRow3 input: \"20202220202\" (same as row1 input?) Actually row3 input: \"20202220202\" same as row1 input? And row3 output: \"22202020202\"? So it's the same transformation as row1? And row5 input: \"22202020202\" and row5 output: \"20202220202\". So row5 seems to be reversed swap relative to row1? Let's compare row5:\nRow5 input: \"22202020202\"\nRow5 output: \"20202220202\"\nWait, row5 input and row5 output: They are reversed relative to row1. Actually, row1 input was \"20202220202\" and row1 output \"22202020202\". Row5 input is the opposite \"22202020202\" and row5 output is \"20202220202\". So maybe the transformation is swapping two specific columns? Which indices changed? For row1, index1 changed from 0 to 2, index5 changed from 2 to 0. For row3, the same. And for row5, input \"22202020202\" becomes \"20202220202\", which is the reverse transformation: index1 changes from 2 to 0, and index5 changes from 0 to 2.\n\nLet's check row0: row0 input and output are identical (\"22202220222\"). So row0 remains same.\nRow2: input \"22202220222\" and output \"22202220222\" are same.\nRow4: same.\nRow6: same.\n\nSo transformation is applied only on some rows? Which rows? They seem to be odd-indexed rows: row1, row3, row5. But row5 got reversed transformation compared to row1. Wait, row1 and row3: They are both odd rows? Actually row1, row3, row5. But row5 transformation is different: row5 input \"22202020202\" -> output \"20202220202\". \nLet's check row1: input \"20202220202\" -> output \"22202020202\". So in row1, digit at index1 changed from 0 to 2, and digit at index5 changed from 2 to 0.\nIn row3, same pattern.\nIn row5, row5 input \"22202020202\" -> output \"20202220202\". So digit at index1 changed from 2 to 0, and digit at index5 changed from 0 to 2.\n\nObservation: It seems that in odd rows, two specific columns are toggled between 0 and 2, but which ones? They are columns 1 and 5 (0-indexed)? Check row1: col1: 0 becomes 2, col5: 2 becomes 0. Row3: col1: 0 becomes 2, col5: 2 becomes 0. And row5: col1: 2 becomes 0, col5: 0 becomes 2. So it looks like the transformation is toggling the bits at columns 1 and 5, but with a twist: For some rows, the order is swapped: for rows 1 and 3, the bit at col1 becomes 2 and bit at col5 becomes 0; for row5, it's the opposite.\n\nMaybe it's not \"odd rows\" but \"rows with a certain pattern in the context of the grid\"? Let's check E2.\n\nE2 Input:\n```\n222022202220222\n222020202020222\n222022202220222\n222020202020202\n222022202220222\n202020202020222\n222022202220222\n202022202020222\n222022202220222\n```\nAnd E2 Output:\n```\n222022202220222\n222022202020202\n222022202220222\n202022202020202\n222022202220222\n222020202020202\n222022202220222\n222020202220202\n222022202220222\n```\nLet's label rows 0-indexed:\n\nRow0: Input: \"222022202220222\", Output: \"222", "prompt_tokens": 795, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The given examples are from ARC tasks. We want to deduce transformation rule from these examples and then apply it to test input grid.\n\nWe have three examples. Let's try to describe them.\n\nE.g. 1: Board size is 16 rows x 16 columns? Let's check: Actually it's 16 rows? Wait, check count: The provided grid lines in Example 1: \"888888888888\" repeated? Actually it's \"16 rows\"? Count rows: There are 16 rows? Check: The provided string for E.g.1 Input is:\n\nRow1: \"888888888888\"\nRow2: \"886666888888\"\nRow3: \"886666888888\"\nRow4: \"886666666888\"\nRow5: \"886666666888\"\nRow6: \"883333333888\"\nRow7: \"883333333888\"\nRow8: \"883333333888\"\nRow9: \"883333333888\"\nRow10: \"883338833888\"\nRow11: \"888888888888\"\nRow12: \"888888888888\"\nRow13: \"888888888888\"\nRow14: \"888888888888\"\nRow15: \"888888888888\"\nRow16: \"888888888888\"\n\nI count 16 rows. And each row has 12 characters? Actually \"888888888888\" is 12 digits. So grid is 16x12.\n\nE.g. 1 Output is:\nRow1: \"888888888888\"\nRow2: \"866668888888\"\nRow3: \"866668888888\"\nRow4: \"866666668888\"\nRow5: \"866666668888\"\nRow6: \"888333333388\"\nRow7: \"888333333388\"\nRow8: \"888333333388\"\nRow9: \"888333333388\"\nRow10: \"888333883388\"\nRow11: \"888888888888\"\nRow12: \"888888888888\"\nRow13: \"888888888888\"\nRow14: \"888888888888\"\nRow15: \"888888888888\"\nRow16: \"888888888888\"\n\nObservations: The transformation seems to be \"flip\" horizontally? Check: Row2 input \"886666888888\" becomes output \"866668888888\". The digits changed from \"886666\" to \"866668\"? Let's compare: Maybe it's reversing the characters in each row? Let's check row2: \"886666888888\" reversed is \"888888668688\"? Actually not sure.\n\nMaybe it's not simply mirror horizontally because row2 input \"886666888888\" output \"866668888888\" is not reversal.\n\nLet's compare row2 input vs output:\nInput row2: 8 8 6 6 6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8\nOutput row2: 8 6 6 6 6 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nLet's align indices:\nIndex 0: input: 8, output: 8 => same maybe.\nIndex 1: input: 8, output: 6, so changed.\nIndex 2: input: 6, output: 6.\nIndex 3: input: 6, output: 6.\nIndex 4: input: 6, output: 6.\nIndex 5: input: 6, output: 8.\nIndex 6: input: 8, output: 8.\nIndex 7: input: 8, output: 8.\nIndex 8: input: 8, output: 8.\nIndex 9: input: 8, output: 8.\nIndex 10: input: 8, output: 8.\nIndex 11: input: 8, output: 8.\n\nSo the change is: The substring is \"886666\" becomes \"866668\". It looks like the transformation involves swapping the first two characters? Not sure.\n\nWait maybe each pattern is a \"symmetric\" transformation: The output seems to be a mirror of the input along a vertical axis. But then row2: input \"886666888888\" reversed is \"888888668688\"? Actually let's check: Reverse row2 \"886666888888\" becomes \"888888668688\". That doesn't equal output \"866668888888\". So not horizontal mirror.\n\nMaybe it's vertical mirror? Let's check: If we mirror column order, then row2 input becomes \"888888668688\" as computed. But output row2 is \"866668888888\", which is different. So not horizontal mirror.\n\nMaybe it's flipping along the diagonal? Possibly reading columns from bottom to top? Let's check column changes.\n\nLet's analyze differences row by row in Example 1.\n\nI see in the output rows, some digits seem to be \"flipped\" or \"rotated\" relative to the input. The digits that change are \"8\" sometimes become \"8\" and sometimes become \"6\"? Actually, look at row2: The first character remains 8. Then the second digit: originally 8 becomes 6. Then digits 6 remain 6, then digit 6 remains 6, then digit 6 remains 6, then digit 6 becomes 8? Then the rest remain 8.\n\nRow4 input: \"886666666888\"\nRow4 output: \"866666668888\"\nComparing: index0: 8 remains 8, index1: 8 becomes 6, index2-? Let's check: Actually row4 input: digits: 8,8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8. Output row4: 8,6,6,6,6,6,6,8,8,8,8,8. So the second digit becomes 6, and the 7th digit becomes 8. So pattern: maybe the leftmost digit remains constant, the digit immediately to the right of the leftmost digit is changed to be the same as the digit that appears at the symmetric position relative to the center of a block of contiguous similar digits? Perhaps the rule is: \"Replace the border of each contiguous region with its complementary digit, preserving the count?\" Alternatively, maybe it's a reflection of groups of digits along the center column.\n\nLet's examine row2: \"886666888888\". It might be segmented as: prefix \"88\", then \"6666\", then \"888888\". The output row2: \"866668888888\". It appears that the first \"8\" of the prefix remains, the second \"8\" becomes \"6\". And in the middle block \"6666\", maybe the leftmost digit remains 6, and the last digit becomes 8. Wait, check row4: \"886666666888\" vs output \"866666668888\". It seems pattern: In each row, the transformation swaps the first digit of a contiguous block of same digit with the last digit of that block? But then row6 input: \"883333333888\" and output: \"888333333388\". Check row6: input: 8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8; output: 8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8. So in row6 input, first block \"88\" becomes \"88\"? Actually, let's segment row6: Possibly segments: Leading block \"88\", then middle block \"3333333\", then trailing block \"888\". Output row6: \"88\", then \"3333333\", but with the leftmost digit of the middle block becomes 8? That doesn't hold.\n\nWait, let's re-read the examples carefully. The transformation might be something like \"rotate the grid 90 degrees\" or \"flip vertically/horizontally\" but then adjust digit values? Perhaps we need to compare Example 1 and Example 2.\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\nRow1: \"111111111111\"\nRow2: \"111111111111\"\nRow3: \"114111444111\"\nRow4: \"114111444111\"\nRow5: \"114444444111\"\nRow6: \"114444444111\"\nRow7: \"112222222111\"\nRow8: \"112222112111\"\nRow9: \"111111111111\"\nRow10: \"111111111111\"\nRow11: \"111111111111\"\nRow12: \"111111111111\"\nE.g. 2 Output:\nRow1: \"111111111111\"\nRow2: \"111111111111\"\nRow3: \"141114441111\"\nRow4: \"141114441111\"\nRow5: \"144444441111\"\nRow6: \"144444441111\"\nRow7: \"111222222211\"\nRow8: \"111222211211\"\nRow9: \"111111111111\"\nRow10: \"111111111111\"\nRow11: \"111111111111\"\nRow12: \"111111111111\"\n\nCompare row3: input \"114111444111\" becomes output \"141114441111\". Look at row3: split into segments: \"11\", \"4\", \"111\", \"444\", \"111\". Output: \"14\", \"111\", \"144\", \"1111\"? Wait, check: Input row3: digits: 1,1,4,1,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,1. Output row3: digits: 1,4,1,1,1,4,4,4,1,1,1,1. The transformation from input to output row3:", "prompt_tokens": 929, "completion_tokens": 2048}

But what is transformation rule? We need to analyze these examples. They are ARC problems that involve pattern transformation. The grid sizes might be different in each example. Let's check dimensions:\nFor e.g. 1, input grid lines: count them. They appear to be 20 lines? Let's count:\nLine1: \"0000002220022200222\" length 18? Actually count digits: \n\"0000002220022200222\" is 18 digits? Let's count: \"000000\" =6, then \"22200\" =5 digits? Wait, let me count carefully:\nWe see pattern: \"0000002220022200222\" \nCount: There are 18 digits? Let's count manually: characters: 0,0,0,0,0,0, 2,2,2,0,0,2,2,2,0,2,2,2? Let's count: Actually I'll count positions: \nPositions: \n1: 0\n2: 0\n3: 0\n4: 0\n5: 0\n6: 0\n7: 2\n8: 2\n9: 2\n10: 0\n11: 0\n12: 2\n13: 2\n14: 2\n15: 0\n16: 2\n17: 2\n18: 2\nYes, 18 digits. So grid is 18 columns wide (columns index 1 to 18). And how many rows? Count lines for e.g. 1: There are 20 rows? Let's count number of lines in e.g. 1 input: It shows:\nLine 1: \"0000002220022200222\"\nLine 2: \"0000002000020000200\"\nLine 3: \"0000022200222002220\"\nLine 4: \"0000022000220002200\"\nLine 5: \"0000000000000000000\"\nLine 6: \"3333333333333333333\"\nLine 7: \"3333333333333333333\"\nLine 8: \"3333333333333333333\"\nLine 9: \"3333333333333333333\"\nLine 10: \"0000000000000000000\"\nLine 11: \"0222002220022200000\"\nLine 12: \"0200002000020000000\"\nLine 13: \"2220022200222000000\"\nLine 14: \"2200022000220000000\"\nLine 15: \"0000000000000000000\"\nLine 16: \"0222002220000000000\"\nLine 17: \"0200002000000000000\"\nLine 18: \"2220022200000000000\"\nLine 19: \"2200022000000000000\"\nWait, that is 19 lines. Actually count again: Actually I see 19 lines? Let's recount: The provided example e.g. 1 input grid is:\n\nLine1: \"0000002220022200222\"\nLine2: \"0000002000020000200\"\nLine3: \"0000022200222002220\"\nLine4: \"0000022000220002200\"\nLine5: \"0000000000000000000\"\nLine6: \"3333333333333333333\"\nLine7: \"3333333333333333333\"\nLine8: \"3333333333333333333\"\nLine9: \"3333333333333333333\"\nLine10: \"0000000000000000000\"\nLine11: \"0222002220022200000\"\nLine12: \"0200002000020000000\"\nLine13: \"2220022200222000000\"\nLine14: \"2200022000220000000\"\nLine15: \"0000000000000000000\"\nLine16: \"0222002220000000000\"\nLine17: \"0200002000000000000\"\nLine18: \"2220022200000000000\"\nLine19: \"2200022000000000000\"\n\nYes, that's 19 rows. And output e.g. 1 has rows:\nLine1: \"0000008220028200228\"\nLine2: \"0000002000020000200\"\nLine3: \"0000022200222002220\"\nLine4: \"0000022000220002200\"\nLine5: \"0000000000000000000\"\nLine6: \"0000002220000000000\"\nLine7: \"0000008000000000000\"\nLine8: \"0000022200000000000\"\nLine9: \"0000022000000000000\"\nLine10: \"0000000000000000000\"\nLine11: \"0222002220022200000\"\nLine12: \"0200002000020000000\"\nLine13: \"8220028200228000000\"\nLine14: \"2200022000220000000\"\nLine15: \"0000000000000000000\"\nLine16: \"0222002220000000000\"\nLine17: \"0200002000000000000\"\nLine18: \"2220022200000000000\"\nLine19: \"8200028000000000000\"\n\nSo transformation is not simply a rotation or reflection because the numbers changed from 2's to 8's in some positions. Let's try to compare input and output positions.\n\nMaybe the rule is: For every contiguous block or maybe consider the grid as having rows that are \"mirrored\" horizontally or something. But let's analyze differences:\n\nLook at e.g. 1 row 1: input \"0000002220022200222\", output \"0000008220028200228\". Compare positions:\n- For row 1, columns:\ncol1-6: \"000000\" remains same.\ncol7: input 2 becomes output 8? Actually check: input row1: \ncol1:0, col2:0, col3:0, col4:0, col5:0, col6:0, col7:2, col8:2, col9:2, col10:0, col11:0, col12:2, col13:2, col14:2, col15:0, col16:2, col17:2, col18:2.\nOutput row1: \"0000008220028200228\". Let's index: col1 to 6: 0, then col7:8, col8:2, col9:2, col10:0, col11:0, col12:2, col13:8, col14:2, col15:0, col16:2, col17:2, col18:8.\nSo differences: col7 changed from 2 to 8, col13 changed from 2 to 8, col18 changed from 2 to 8. Similarly, row 1, col? \nWait, let me check: input row1: indexes: \n0-index: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:2,7:2,8:2,9:0,10:0,11:2,12:2,13:2,14:0,15:2,16:2,17:2.\nOutput row1: indexes: \n0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:8,7:2,8:2,9:0,", "prompt_tokens": 1097, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The digits changed: \"8\" became \"4\", \"8\" became \"4\", \"4\" remains \"4\", \"0\" remains \"0\", etc. Wait, let's compare: input row 2: 0 8 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output: 0 4 4 8 0 0 0 0 0 0. So it looks like digits in the second and third positions flipped? Actually, check: indices: first digit (index 0) remains 0. second digit: changed from 8 to 4. third digit: changed from 8 to 4. fourth digit: changed from 4 to 8. The rest remain same. So transformation: swap the two outer digits and then swap the inner pair? Let's check row 3: \"0484000000\" becomes \"0848000000\". Compare: input row 3: [0,4,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Output: [0,8,4,8,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So mapping: second digit: 4 becomes 8, third digit: 8 becomes 4, fourth digit: 4 becomes 8? Wait, check carefully: row 3: positions: 0: 0, 1: 4, 2: 8, 3: 4, so output row 3: 0,8,4,8,0,... So transformation: second digit and fourth digit swapped? Wait, check row 4 input: \"0884000000\" becomes \"0448000000\", which is symmetric to row 2 but reversed order? Let's check row 4: input: 0,8,8,4,0,... output: 0,4,4,8,... It is exactly same as row 2 output. Similarly, row 5: \"0000003220\" becomes \"0000002330\": compare: \"3220\" becomes \"2330\". So digits: The last 4 characters: positions 6,7,8,9: 3,2,2,0 become 2,3,3,0. So transformation: swap the first two and then change them? Wait, row 6: \"0000003320\" becomes \"0000002230\": last digits: 3,3,2,0 become 2,2,3,0. Row 7: \"0000003220\" becomes \"0000002330\": same as row 5. So it appears that transformation is swapping the first two digits among the last four digits? But wait, check row 9: \"0036300000\" becomes \"0063600000\": last four digits are \"3000\" become \"6000\"? But wait, positions: row 9 input: \"0036300000\", so digits: index 0:0,1:0,2:3,3:6,4:3,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0. Output: \"0063600000\", digits: index 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:6,4:3,5:6,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0. So transformation: the digits at positions 2 and 4 in input become positions 2 and 4 in output? Actually, let's re-read row 9: \nInput: \"0036300000\"\nOutput: \"0063600000\"\nMapping: index0: 0->0, index1: 0->0, index2: 3->? Actually, let's compare digit by digit:\nInput row 9: 0,0,3,6,3,0,0,0,0,0.\nOutput row 9: 0,0,0,6,3,6,0,0,0,0.\nSo what happened? It seems like the digit at index 2 (which is 3) moved to index 5? And the digit at index 4 (which is 3) moved to index 2? Wait, check row 10: Input: \"0036300000\" becomes \"0063600000\" same as row 9? Actually, row 10 input: \"0036300000\" becomes output: \"0063600000\". Wait, row 10 is same as row 9, but output row 10 is \"0066600000\". Let's re-read e.g.1 details: Actually, the given e.g.1 output rows:\nRow 9: \"0063600000\"\nRow 10: \"0063600000\" or \"0066600000\"? Let's re-read provided e.g.1 output: \nRow 9: \"0063600000\",\nRow 10: \"0063600000\",\nRow 11: \"0066600000\".\nWait, need to re-read carefully:\n\nE.g. 1 Input rows:\nRow 1: 0000000000\nRow 2: 0884000000\nRow 3: 0484000000\nRow 4: 0884000000\nRow 5: 0000003220\nRow 6: 0000003320\nRow 7: 0000003220\nRow 8: 0000000000\nRow 9: 0036300000\nRow 10: 0036300000\nRow 11: 0033300000\nRow 12: 0000000000\nRow 13: 0000000000\n\nE.g. 1 Output rows:\nRow 1: 0000000000\nRow 2: 0448000000\nRow 3: 0848000000\nRow 4: 0448000000\nRow 5: 0000002330\nRow 6: 0000002230\nRow 7: 0000002330\nRow 8: 0000000000\nRow 9: 0063600000\nRow 10: 0063600000\nRow 11: 0066600000\nRow 12: 0000000000\nRow 13: 0000000000\n\nLet's check row 9 transformation in detail:\nInput row 9: \"0036300000\". The digits: \nindex: 0:0, 1:0, 2:3, 3:6, 4:3, 5:0, 6:0, 7:0, 8:0, 9:0.\nOutput row 9: \"0063600000\". digits: index0:0,1:0,2:0,3:6,4:3,5:6,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0.\nSo what changed? The digit '3' at index 2 and the digit '3' at index 4 in the input, they are swapped with a '6'? Because output index2 is 0 and index5 is 6. But then where did the '6' come from? Actually, check: index3 in input is 6 and remains at index3 in output. So maybe the rule is: Swap the two leftmost non-zero digits in a certain region? Let's compare row 10: Input: \"0036300000\", output: \"0063600000\"? Actually, row 10 in e.g. 1 output is \"0063600000\" in provided text? Wait, re-read provided e.g. 1 output rows: row 9: \"0063600000\", row 10:", "prompt_tokens": 759, "completion_tokens": 2048}

But in E.g. 1, each line is 16 digits. So check: E.g. 1 line \"0000000000000000\" is 16 digits. So E.g. 2 lines \"00000000000000\" count digits: let's count: \"00000000000000\" - count zeros: There are 14 zeros? Actually, count manually: \"00000000000000\": each group of four: \"0000\", \"0000\", \"0000\", \"0000\". That is 16 digits. So each line is 16 digits. So E.g. 2 Input has 15 lines, and E.g.2 Output has 14 lines?

So 13 lines, while E.g. 3 Output: \nLine1: \"0050000700030\" (14 digits)\nLine2: \"0050000700030\"\nLine3: \"3323333233333\"\nLine4: \"0050000700030\"\nLine5: \"5555555255525\"\nLine6: \"0050000700030\"\nLine7: \"0050000700030\"\nLine8: \"0050000700030\"\nLine9: \"0050000700030\"\nLine10:\"0050000700030\"\nLine11:\"0050000700030\"\nLine12:\"7727777777727\"\nLine13:\"0050000700030\"\nSo E.g. 3 Output has 13 lines. So grid sizes vary. But the transformation rule might be something like \"mirror\" or \"rotational symmetry\" or \"reflective symmetry\" etc.\n\nI suspect it's a puzzle from ARC which is often solved by drawing lines from nonzero digits to match a pattern?

Not sure.\n\nWait, let me try to analyze Example 1. Looking at input grid, it seems that the non-zero numbers in input are \"3\", \"1\", \"0\", etc. Actually, input grid has digits: 0, 3, 1, 2, 8 maybe? Check row1: \"0000000000300\" has a \"3\" in the 10th column (if indexing columns from left). Row2: \"0000111100000\" has \"1\"s. Row3: \"0000100100000\" has a \"1\" in column 4? Actually, let's label coordinates: grid is 13x13 maybe? Actually, row0 length: 13 columns? Let's count: \"0000000000000\" has 13 zeros? Actually count digits: \"0000000000000\" count: 13 digits? Wait, count careful: \"0000000000000\" looks like 13 digits? Let's count: \"0000000000000\" is indeed 13 digits if each group is separated by space? There's no spaces though. Let's count: \"0000000000000\" count: 13 zeros? But then row1 \"0000000000300\" count: 13 digits? Let's count: \"0000000000300\" = 13 digits? Let's count: digits: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0. So yes, 13 columns. So grid is 13 rows x 13 columns.\n\nNow what is transformation? Look at output grid digits: They are mostly 3. But then some rows have a pattern \"3333222233333\" etc. It might be that the transformation rule is: For each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding input cell is non-zero, then find the nearest non-zero \"seed\" or something? Alternatively, maybe it's like a \"distance transform\" algorithm, where the output digit equals the Manhattan distance from a specific set of \"seeds\"? But then output is \"3\" in many places. But wait, output digits: They are 2, 3, and 8 in example 1. Possibly transformation rule: \"Replace each digit in input with a digit that is computed based on its neighbors.\" But then what about \"8\"? Possibly sum of neighbors? Let me try to see pattern differences.\n\nI see in Example 1, the output grid is almost entirely 3's except in a band in the middle. Compare row 2 input: \"0000111100000\" becomes output: \"3333222233333\". The middle part \"1111\" in input becomes \"2222\" in output. Similarly row 5: \"0020008010000\" becomes \"3328888823333\". So maybe the digits in input are not directly carried over; they are transformed.\n\nMaybe rule: Take the input grid, and then for each cell, output the count of certain features in its neighborhood? Alternatively, maybe the rule is: \"Sum the digits in a plus shape around each cell\" mod something? \n\nLet's check row 2: \"0000111100000\" => center digits are \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\". They become \"2\", \"2\", \"2\", \"2\" in output. Row 0: \"0000000000000\" becomes \"3333333333333\". So output is 3 everywhere on border? Possibly rule: if input cell is 0, output becomes 3. But then row2: input had 1's become 2's. And row 1: \"0000000000300\" becomes \"3333333333333\", meaning the cell that was 3 in input seems to produce a 3 in output. Also row 3: \"0000100100000\" becomes \"3333288233333\". The digit \"1\" at column? Let\u2019s index row3: \"0000100100000\": positions: digits: index0=0,1=0,2=0,3=0,4=1,5=0,6=0,7=1,8=0,9=0,10=0,11=0,12=0. And output row3: \"3333288233333\": digits: index0=3,1=3,2=3,3=3,4=2,5=8,6=8,7=2,8=3,9=3,10=3,11=3,12=3. So for input digits \"1\" became \"2\" for one of them, and \"1\" became \"8\" for the other one in same row. So transformation is not simply mapping 0 to 3 etc.\n\nMaybe rule: \"Replace each digit with a digit computed from the sum of its neighbors\"? Perhaps it's a rule that \"draws a diamond shape\" maybe like \"flood fill\" from boundaries with different seeds. Look at row 12 output: \"3333333333333\" but row 12 input is \"0000000000000\", so border becomes 3. Similarly, row 0 output is 3's, even though row0 input is 0's. So maybe border cells always become 3. Then inner cells come from something else.\n\nMaybe rule: \"For each cell, output the maximum value among the four neighbors plus the original cell value\"? Let's test row3, col4: In input, row3 col4 is 1. Its neighbors (row2 col4, row3 col3, row3 col5, row4 col4) what are they? row2 col4: from \"0000111100000\", col4 is 1? Actually, row2: digits: index0=0,1=0,2=0,3=0,4=1,5=1,6=1,7=1,8=0,9=0,10=0,11=0,12=0. So neighbors: row2 col4 = 1, row3 col3 = 0, row3 col5 = 0, row4 col4: row4 \"0011100110000\": index4 = 1 maybe? Let's check row4: \"0011100110000\": digits: index0=0,1=0, index2=1, index3=1, index4=1, index5=0, index6=0, index7=1, index8=1, etc. Wait, recalc row4: \"0011100110000\": characters: 0,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0. So index4=1. So maximum among neighbors is 1, plus maybe the center cell 1 gives 2. But output row3, col4 is 2, that fits if rule is \"center + max neighbor\"? But then row3, col7: input is 1. Its neighbors: row2 col7: from row2: \"0000111100000\", index7=1; row3 col6: input row3 col6 = 0; row3 col8: input row3 col8 = 0; row4 col7: row4: index7=1. So max neighbor is 1, plus cell value 1 equals 2, but output row3, col7 is 8, not 2. So not that.\n\nMaybe rule: \"If cell is 0, output 3. If cell is 1, then output 2 or 8 depending on its position relative to some structure\"? Look at row3: two 1", "prompt_tokens": 967, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Wait check: input \"577366677\" vs output \"577317777\". So looks like transformation on some digits.\n\nLet's align positions:\nLine1: Input: 8 9 5 5 9 4 8 8 4 5 7 7 3 6 6 6 7 7 1 3 7 7 5 4 8 8 9 5 5\nOutput: 8 9 5 5 9 4 8 8 4 5 7 7 3 1 7 7 7 7 1 3 7 7 5 4 8 8 9 5 5\nSo positions 12-15? Let's see more precisely:\nIndexing from 0:\n0:8,1:9,2:5,3:5,4:9,5:4,6:8,7:8,8:4,9:5,10:7,11:7,12:3,13:6,14:6,15:6,16:7,17:7,18:1,19:3,20:7,21:7,22:5,23:4,24:8,25:8,26:9,27:5,28:5.\nOutput:\n0:8,1:9,2:5,3:5,4:9,5:4,6:8,7:8,8:4,9:5,10:7,11:7,12:3,13:1,14:7,15:7,16:7,17:7,18:1,19:3,20:7,21:7,22:5,23:4,24:8,25:8,26:9,27:5,28:5.\nSo the difference is at positions 13-16? Actually, let me compare substring from position 12 onward:\nInput substring from pos12: \"366677\" vs output substring: \"177777\". Wait check, input: pos12=3, pos13=6, pos14=6, pos15=6, pos16=7, pos17=7. Output: pos12=3, pos13=1, pos14=7, pos15=7, pos16=7, pos17=7. So the difference is that the second digit in that group is changed from 6 to 1. But then the rest of the digits are changed? Let's check further:\nAfter that, input: \"137754884955\" vs output: \"137754884955\"? Actually, let's re-read the full line with segmentation: The substring \"366677\" becomes \"177777\"? Not exactly, because input: \"3 6 6 6 7 7\" and output: \"3 1 7 7 7 7\". So pattern: The first digit remains same (3), then the next digits become 7 except the first digit after 3 becomes 1? Let's check line 2:\nInput line 2: \"985849885477166697717745889485\"\nOutput line2: \"985849885477177997717745889485\"\nCompare substring from pos? Let's find difference:\nProbably similar pattern: the group \"166697\" becomes \"177997\"? Let's break it:\nInput line2: \"985849885477166697717745889485\"\nOutput: \"985849885477177997717745889485\"\nSo the difference is in the substring after \"985849885477\". Input substring: \"166697\" becomes output: \"177997\". So transformation: \"166697\" -> \"177997\". Compare digits: input: 1,6,6,6,9,7; output: 1,7,7,9,9,7. So pattern: the first digit remains same, then the next two digits become 7? Actually, input: 6,6,6 become output: 7,7,9? Not exactly. Let's try to align:\nMaybe it's a pattern in which some digits in the grid are replaced: maybe they are turning some digits into others.\n\nLet's check e.g. 1 line3: \nInput line3: \"552288177777766699777777718822\"\nOutput: \"552288177777779999777777718822\"\nSubstrings: original: \"777766699777777718822\"\nOutput: \"777779999777777718822\"\nSo the difference is in the middle: \"766699\" becomes \"79999\" but lengths differ? Let's count:\nInput: \"552288\" then \"177777\" then \"766699\" then \"777777\" then \"718822\"\nOutput: \"552288\" then \"177777\" then \"779999\" then \"777777\" then \"718822\"\nSo transformation: \"766699\" becomes \"779999\".

We want to deduce transformation rule that maps input grid to output grid.\n\nObservations:\n\nFor Example 1:\nInput grid: \nRow1: \"080\"\nRow2: \"808\"\nRow3: \"000\"\nOutput grid: \nRows:\n1: \"808808\"\n2: \"080080\"\n3: \"888888\"\n4: \"808808\"\n5: \"080080\"\n6: \"888888\"\n\nObservations: The input grid is 3 rows of 3 cells. The output grid is 6 rows of 6 cells. It appears that the transformation is to double each row, then double each cell? But not exactly: Let's check: The input row \"080\" becomes \"808808\"? Let's check: \"080\" -> might be rotated? Possibly not.\n\nWait, check: Input row \"080\" becomes \"808808\" in output row 1. Compare pattern: \"080\" output row 1: \"808808\". It might be that the top row is replaced by a pattern that is a \"mirroring\" or \"reflection\" of the input row's \"pattern\"? Let's check: \"080\" reversed is \"080\" as well. But \"808\" reversed is \"808\". But then \"000\" reversed is \"000\". That doesn't match.\n\nMaybe it's a scaling transformation. Notice that output grid is 6x6 and input grid is 3x3. Perhaps the transformation is to expand it by a factor of 2. But then each cell becomes a 2x2 block of the same value? But the outputs are not uniform blocks.\n\nWait, let's analyze. For example 1, input grid:\nRow1: 0 8 0\nRow2: 8 0 8\nRow3: 0 0 0\n\nOutput grid rows:\nRow1: 8 0 8 | 8 0 8? Actually, output row 1 is \"808808\" which can be split into two groups: \"808\", \"808\". \nRow2: \"080080\" which is \"080\" \"080\".\nRow3: \"888888\" which is \"888\" \"888\".\nRow4: \"808808\"\nRow5: \"080080\"\nRow6: \"888888\".\n\nIt seems like the output grid is double the size in both dimensions, but the pattern is not simply repeating each cell block. Let's try to see if there's a relation between input and output cell values. Perhaps the transformation rule involves some sort of \"reflection\" or \"mirroring\" of rows? Let's try to see: The output grid's top half is the same as bottom half. Actually, rows 1-3 are the same as rows 4-6. So the output grid is vertically mirrored, with the top half repeated. Also, horizontally, each row in output is repeated twice.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: \"Double the grid vertically and horizontally, then reflect horizontally?\" But the example 2: Input: two rows \"70\" and \"07\", output grid is 4 rows of 4 cells. Let's re-read Example 2:\n\nInput:\n70\n07\nOutput:\n0707\n7070\n0707\n7070\n\nLet's check: The input grid: Row1: \"70\", Row2: \"07\". The output grid: Each row is 4 cells. How can we get that? Possibly by taking the input grid, duplicating columns and rows, then maybe adding a twist? Let's try: If you double rows, you'll get \"70 70\" and \"07 07\". But the output rows are \"0707\", \"7070\", \"0707\", \"7070\". But wait, \"70 70\" is \"7070\", not \"0707\". So something else is happening.\n\nMaybe the transformation is: \"Rotate the grid 90 degrees\" or \"flip\" something.\n\nLet's consider example 3:\nInput:\n4000\n0444\n0040\n0400\nOutput:\n04440444\n40004000\n44044404\n40444044\n04440444\n40004000\n44044404\n40444044\n\nThe input grid is 4x4, the output grid is 8x8. And the pattern: The output grid appears to be arranged in two halves, each half is a repetition of the other? Check: The output grid's first 4 rows and last 4 rows are identical. And each row is repeated twice? Let's check: In output, row1: \"04440444\". Row2: \"40004000\". Row3: \"44044404\". Row4: \"40444044\". Then row5: \"04440444\" repeats row1, etc. Similarly, each row within the half: Actually, row1 and row2 are not identical. But the pattern: The output grid 8x8 is formed by repeating the 4x4 grid twice vertically and twice horizontally. But wait: Let's check: If you take the input grid and double it in both dimensions, you might get a grid where each cell is repeated in a 2x2 block. For example, if input is 4000, then doubling each cell in a 2x2 block would yield \"44 00 00\" But the output row1 is \"04440444\" which is 8 digits. Let's try: If we take each digit in the input and duplicate it horizontally and vertically, we would get a block of 4x4? But the output is 8x8 for a 4x4 input. Wait, let me recalc: In example 3, doubling each cell in a 2x2 block from a 4x4 input would yield an 8x8 grid. But then each cell's value would be constant over a 2x2 block. But in output, for instance, row1: \"04440444\" can be segmented as: \"04\", \"44\", \"04\", \"44\". So each pair of digits in row1 corresponds to one cell from the input? Let's check: The input row1 is \"4000\". If we double each cell in a 2x2 block, then the first cell (4) becomes \"44\", the second cell (0) becomes \"00\", then the third cell (0) becomes \"00\", fourth cell (0) becomes \"00\", so we would get \"44000000\" if we did that. But output row1 is \"04440444\". So that's not consistent.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is not a simple replication. Let's look at pattern differences between input and output digit positions.\n\nLet's re-read problem description: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule.\" The examples are likely meant to illustrate a particular pattern transformation rule.\n\nMaybe the rule involves \"symmetry\" and \"complement\" operations. In example 1, the input digits: 0 and 8. The output digits: they are 8, 0, 8, 8. And also 080 becomes 808808, which is like swapping the outer digits? Wait, note: \"080\" becomes \"808808\" in row1 of output. Look at row2: \"808\" becomes \"080080\". Row3: \"000\" becomes \"888888\". So what transformation is applied to each row? It might be that the transformation rule involves replacing 0 with 8 and 8 with 0 except possibly in certain positions. Let's check: In the first row input \"080\", if we flip each digit (swap 0 with 8) we would get \"808\" but then how do we get \"808808\"? That is \"808\" concatenated with \"808\". So the row is repeated, but with digits swapped? Let's test: For row2, input \"808\". Flipping each digit (swap 0 <-> 8) yields \"080\". And then if we double that, we get \"080080\", which matches row2 of output. For row3, input \"000\". Flipping 0 would yield ... But wait, if we flip 0, do we get 8? It appears in output row3 we get \"888888\". That implies that 0 becomes 8 when flipped. And then for row1, \"080\" becomes \"808\" if we swap each digit, but that is exactly what we see in each half. So maybe the rule is: For each input grid, transform each cell by swapping 0 and 8. Then double the grid in both dimensions.\n\nBut let's test with Example 2: Input: \"70\" becomes what? But then we see digits 7 and 0. But if we swap 0 and 8, then 7 remains 7, 0 becomes 8? But then row1", "prompt_tokens": 517, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Actually let's check each example) and output grid. We need to deduce transformation rule.\n\nLet's restate examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput grid:\nRow1: 000000000\nRow2: 008800000\nRow3: 088800400\nRow4: 008000000\nRow5: 000000000\nRow6: 000000400\nRow7: 000000000\nRow8: 000000000\nRow9: 000000000\n\nOutput grid:\nRow1: 088088\nRow2: 888888\nRow3: 080080\n\nSo in example 1, input is 9 row grid but output is 3 row grid. The transformation: It appears that we are reading the input grid and extracting some pattern. Let's look at row counts: input 9 rows, output 3 rows. Similarly, example 2: Input grid: 9 rows. Output: 3 rows. Example 3: Input grid: 9 rows, output grid: 9 rows? Wait, check example 3:\nE.g. 3 Input:\nRow1: 000000000\nRow2: 000004000\nRow3: 000000000\nRow4: 088800000\nRow5: 008000000\nRow6: 000000400\nRow7: 000000000\nRow8: 000400000\nRow9: 000000000\n\nAnd output grid:\nRow1: 000000000\nRow2: 888888888\nRow3: 080080080\n\nSo output grid is 3 rows, not 9. Wait check: The provided output has 3 rows, each row is 9 cells? But the provided output lines \"000000000\", \"888888888\", \"080080080\" are 9 columns each. Wait, check E.g.1 output: \"088088\" is 6 columns? Let's check the lengths: E.g. 1 Output lines: \"088088\" (6 characters) then \"888888\" (6 characters) then \"080080\" (6 characters). But then E.g. 2 output: \"080\" (3 characters), \"880\" (3 characters), \"088\" (3 characters). E.g. 3 output: \"000000000\" (9 characters), \"888888888\" (9 characters), \"080080080\" (9 characters). E.g. 4 output: \"008008008\" (9 characters), \"880880880\" (9 characters), \"880880880\" (9 characters). E.g. 5 output: \"088088088088\" (12 characters), \"880880880880\" (12 characters), \"080080080080\" (12 characters).\n\nSo outputs are grids with different dimensions. So what's the transformation rule? Possibly it is to extract a diagonal pattern or something about symmetry. Let's check positions of nonzero digits in the input grids.\n\nLet's analyze E.g.1:\nInput grid 9 x 9\nNonzero digits: \nRow2: columns: \"008800000\" => nonzero: '8'? Actually row2: \"008800000\" means first digit is 0, second digit 0, third digit 8, fourth digit 8, fifth digit 0, sixth digit 0, etc.\nRow3: \"088800400\": nonzero: columns: 1:0, 2:8, 3:8, 4:8, 5:0, 6:0, 7:4, 8:0, 9:0? Actually check: \"088800400\": \n- char1 = 0, char2 = 8, char3 = 8, char4 = 8, char5 = 0, char6 = 0, char7 = 4, char8 = 0, char9 = 0.\nRow4: \"008000000\": nonzero digits: col2:0? Actually \"008000000\": first char=0, second char=0, third char=8, rest zeros.\nRow6: \"000000400\": nonzero digit: col7=4.\nRow? Also row? Wait, let's re-read input properly:\n\nE.g.1 Input:\nRow1: 000000000\nRow2: 008800000\nRow3: 088800400\nRow4: 008000000\nRow5: 000000000\nRow6: 000000400\nRow7: 000000000\nRow8: 000000000\nRow9: 000000000\n\nSo, nonzero positions:\nRow2: col3, col4 are 8's.\nRow3: col2, col3, col4 are 8's, col7 is 4.\nRow4: col3 is 8.\nRow6: col7 is 4.\n\nSo the pattern: There are two main \"8\" clusters and two \"4\" positions. The output grid: 3 rows x 6 columns.\nMaybe the transformation rule is: take the top-left 3x? But then how many columns? \nMaybe the rule is to place the nonzero values along the main diagonal of a square matrix? But outputs have pattern like 088088, 888888, 080080. They have a pattern of alternating 0 and 8 or 4. \nWait, look at output E.g.1: \nRow1: 0 8 8 0 8 8\nRow2: 8 8 8 8 8 8\nRow3: 0 8 0 8 0 8\nThere is a 6-digit pattern. Notice that row2 is all 8's. The other rows have alternating 0 and 8, except one row starts with 0 and one row is all 8.\nCheck E.g.2:\nInput grid:\nRow1: 000000000\nRow2: 000000000\nRow3: 000040000\nRow4: 000000000\nRow5: 000000000\nRow6: 008000000\nRow7: 088000000\nRow8: 008800000\nRow9: 000000000\n\nNonzero positions:\nRow3: col4 is 4.\nRow6: col1 is 0? Actually \"008000000\": that string is \"008000000\", so digits: 0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow7: \"088000000\": digits: 0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow8: \"008800000\": digits: 0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nSo output grid E.g.2:\nRow1: 080\nRow2: 880\nRow3: 088\nSo output is 3 rows x 3 columns.\nPattern: row1: 0,8,0; row2: 8,8,0? Actually \"880\" row2: 8,8,0; row3: 0,8,8.\nIt looks like a rotation or reflection of the nonzero pattern.\n\nMaybe the transformation is: extract the \"skeleton\" of the input grid by taking the positions of the nonzero cells and then \"rotate\" or \"reflect\" them into a smaller grid. Wait, maybe it's like a \"diagonal extraction\" from the input grid? Let's check E.g.3:\nInput grid E.g.3:\nRow1: 000000000\nRow2: 000004000\nRow3: 000000000\nRow4: 088800000\nRow5: 008000000\nRow6: 000000400\nRow7: 000000000\nRow8: 000400000\nRow9: 000000000\n\nNonzero positions:\nRow2: col5 is 4. \nRow4: \"088800000\": digits: col1=0, col2=8, col3=8, col4=8, col5=0, col6=0, col7=0, col8=0, col9=0.\nRow5: \"008000000\": digit: col3 is 8.\nRow6: \"000000400\": digit: col7 is 4.\nRow8: \"000400000\": digit: col4 is 4.\nOutput grid E.g.3:\nRow1: 000000000 (9 cells)\nRow2: 888888888 (9 cells)\nRow3: 080080080 (9 cells)\n\nSo output grid dimensions 3 x 9. So different examples have different output dimensions.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: count the number of nonzero cells in each row and then form a pattern? \nLet's check: For E.g. 1, input grid is 9 rows, but output grid is 3 rows. For E.g.2, output grid is 3 rows. For E.g.3, output grid is 3 rows. For E.g.4, output grid is 3 rows x 9 columns? Actually E.g.4: Input grid is 9 rows, output grid has 3 rows each of length 9. E.g.5: Input grid 9 rows, output grid is 3 rows each of length 12. So output rows count seems to be always 3 in these examples? Except E.g.1 output had 3 rows, but column count varied: E.g.1 had 6 columns, E.g.3 had", "prompt_tokens": 719, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Actually, examine: The provided input \"855\" appears twice in the output row 7? Wait, row 7 output is \"000855855\"? That is 9 digits. It is \"000\" + \"855\" + \"855\"? Let's check row 8: \"000888888\": That equals \"000\" + \"888\" + \"888\". Row 9: \"000599599\": equals \"000\" + \"599\" + \"599\". So what might be pattern? In e.g. 1, row 1: \"000000996\" equals \"000000\" + \"996\". But wait, in e.g. 1, row1 is \"000000996\", but input row \"996\" is in row1? But then row 2: \"000000388\" equals \"000000\" + \"388\", and row 3: \"000000833\" equals \"000000\" + \"833\". But then the remaining rows are zeros. So how is the placement of input rows? Let\u2019s compare e.g. 1: Input rows appear in rows 1,2,3? But then e.g. 2: They appear in rows 7,8,9?

Wait, examine e.g.3 row 1: \"000717000\": It's 9 digits, with input \"717\" in the middle three digits? E.g.3 row 2: \"000177000\", row 3: \"000717000\". Then row 4: \"717000000\": that is input row \"717\" in the left block? Row 5: \"177000000\", row 6: \"717000000\". Then row 7,8,9 are again \"000717000\", \"000177000\", \"000717000\".\n\nSo e.g.3: It seems the output is a 9x9 grid, and the input 3 rows are arranged in some pattern. Let's compare e.g.4:\nInput:\n327\n227\n557\n\nOutput:\nRow1: \"327000000\"\nRow2: \"227000000\"\nRow3: \"557000000\"\nRow4: \"000000000\"\nRow5: \"000000000\"\nRow6: \"000000000\"\nRow7: \"000000000\"\nRow8: \"000000000\"\nRow9: \"000000000\"\n\nSo in e.g.4, the input rows appear in the first three rows of the output.\n\nE.g. 5:\nInput:\n166\n516\n555\n\nOutput:\nRow1: \"166000000\"\nRow2: \"516000000\"\nRow3: \"555000000\"\nRow4: \"000166000\"\nRow5: \"000516000\"\nRow6: \"000555000\"\nRow7: \"000000000\"\nRow8: \"000000000\"\nRow9: \"000000000\"\n\nSo e.g.5: The input rows appear in rows 1-3 and then rows 4-6, with the original input rows repeated in the top block and then shifted to the right? Actually, row1: \"166000000\" and row4: \"000166000\" differ by a cyclic shift?\nWait, row1: \"166000000\" - the digits \"166\" are at beginning. row4: \"000166000\" - the digits \"166\" are in the middle.\n\nE.g.6:\nInput:\n442\n222\n242\n\nOutput:\nRow1: \"442442000\"\nRow2: \"222222000\"\nRow3: \"242242000\"\nRow4: \"000000000\"\nRow5: \"000000000\"\nRow6: \"000000000\"\nRow7: \"000442000\"\nRow8: \"000222000\"\nRow9: \"000242000\"\n\nSo e.g.6: The first three rows: \"442442000\" etc: It looks like they are concatenating the input row with itself? Because \"442\" concatenated with \"442\" gives \"442442\", then appended with \"000\". And then rows 7-9 are similar but with prefix \"000\". But then e.g.2: rows 7-9: \"000855855\" etc: that is \"000\" + the input row + the input row. E.g.3: rows 1-3: \"000717000\": That is \"000\" + input row + \"000\", while rows 4-6: \"717000000\": That is input row + \"000000\". And rows 7-9: again \"000717000\".\n\nSo what's the pattern? The transformation rule seems to be a 3x3 input is expanded to a 9x9 output. The transformation appears to place copies of the input in different \"blocks\" of the output grid depending on the input values maybe?\n\nLet's re-read the examples description: \"The input grid is a 3x3 grid, the output grid is a 9x9 grid. The transformation rule is hidden. The examples are multiple pairs.\"\n\nObserving e.g.1: The output grid has the input rows in the top block? Actually, e.g.1: rows 1-3 are \"000\" + input row + \"000\"? But in e.g.1 row1 is \"000000996\", which is 6 zeros then 996, not \"000\" at beginning then 996 then \"000\". Let's count digits: \"000000996\" is 9 digits. It splits as \"000000\" + \"996\". So the input row \"996\" appears at the end, not in the middle. For e.g.1: The input rows appear at the end of the rows: row1: \"000000996\", row2: \"000000388\", row3: \"000000833\". And then rows 4-9 are zeros. So e.g.1: the input rows are appended to the right end of the row, preceded by 6 zeros. But then e.g.2: the input rows appear in rows 7-9, but with prefix \"000\" and then the input row repeated twice? Actually, row7: \"000855855\" -> if we split as \"000\" + \"855\" + \"855\". So maybe the rule is to place the input grid into a 9x9 grid in one of four positions: top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right? Let's check e.g.3: It has three blocks:\nBlock 1 (top-left 3 rows): rows 1-3: \"000\" + input row + \"000\". \nBlock 2 (middle-left 3 rows): rows 4-6: input row + \"000000\".\nBlock 3 (bottom-left 3 rows): rows 7-9: \"000\" + input row + \"000\".\nWait, but", "prompt_tokens": 721, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Or maybe it's like a \"slide\" transformation where numbers get shifted.\n\nWait, let's check details: Look at E.g. 1, row 4:\nInput row 4: 1143215724613572461357246135\nOutput row 4: same string.

Let's try to segment: \"114235724\" is 10 characters, then \"60000006\" is 8 characters? Actually, count: \"114235724\" has length 10, then \"60000006\" has length 8, then \"1357246135\" length 10? Actually, let's count: 10+? Wait, the total length of row 5 is 30 maybe? Let me count digits: \"1142357246000000613572461357\". Count digits: 1-1-1-2-3-5-7-2-4 - that's 9 digits? Let's count properly:\n\"114235724\" is 9 digits? Actually, check: \"1\", \"1\", \"4\", \"2\", \"3\", \"5\", \"7\", \"2\", \"4\" that's 9 digits.

Actually string \"0011100000\": col1=0, col2=0, col3=1, col4=1, col5=1, col6=0, etc.\nRow3: \"0000006000\": digit 6 at col7.\nRow4: \"6600006600\": digits: col1=6, col2=6, col5=6. Actually \"6600006600\": let's check: positions: col1=6, col2=6, col3=0, col4=0, col5=0, col6=0, col7=6, col8=0, col9=0, col10=0.\nRow5: \"6600000000\": digits at col1=6, col2=6.\nRow6: \"0011100000\": same as row2.\nRow7: \"0111100000\": digits: col2=1? Wait, \"0111100000\": col1=0, col2=1, col3=1, col4=1, col5=1, col6=0, rest zeros.\nRow8: \"0000000000\": zero row.\nRow9: \"0000000000\": zero row.\nRow10: \"0000000000\": zero row.\n\nNow, output:\nRow1: \"0000000000\"\nRow2: \"0000000000\"\nRow3: \"0000000000\"\nRow4: \"0000000000\"\nRow5: \"0000000000\"\nRow6: \"6000100000\"\nRow7: \"6601110000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"6600111000\"\nRow10: \"6601111000\"\n\nObserving transformation: The \"1\" digits from top rows appear later rows. The \"6\" digits appear shifted left and right.\n\nMaybe rule: The transformation might be \"flip vertically\" then \"rotate\"? But output row order: The highest row row1 becomes row? Actually, let's check positions: In input, row1 had a \"1\" at col4. In output, row10 has \"1\" at col? Wait, check output:\nRow6: \"6000100000\": has \"6\" at col1, \"0\" at col2, \"0\" at col3, \"0\" at col4, \"1\" at col5, then zeros. \nRow7: \"6601110000\": has \"6\" at col1, \"6\" at col2, \"0\" at col3, \"1\" at col4, \"1\" at col5, \"1\" at col6.\nRow9: \"6600111000\": \"6\" at col1, \"6\" at col2, \"0\" at col3, \"0\" at col4, \"1\" at col5, \"1\" at col6, \"1\" at col7? Actually, let's count: \"6600111000\": digits: col1=6, col2=6, col3=0, col4=0, col5=1, col6=1, col7=1, col8=0, col9=0, col10=0.\nRow10: \"6601111000\": \"6\" at col1, \"6\" at col2, \"0\" at col3, \"1\" at col4, \"1\" at col5, \"1\" at col6, \"1\" at col7, then 0's.\n\nIt seems that the positions of certain digits are permuted. Let's try to map coordinate positions from input to output.\n\nMaybe it's a block manipulation: There are two disjoint clusters in input? Perhaps transformation rule: \"invert the colors\" might be consistent with ARC tasks sometimes. But this task: \"Analyze the provided examples\" then \"determine the transformation rule\" and then \"apply to test input\".\n\nI suspect the transformation rule might be: \"Reflect the entire grid along a diagonal\" but then I'm not sure.\n\nLet's check E.g. 2:\n\nEg. 2 Input:\nRows:\n1: 0000000000\n2: 0000000000\n3: 0333300333\n4: 0330000000\n5: 0330444000\n6: 0000044000\n7: 0000040040\n8: 0000000040\n9: 0000000440\n10:0000000000\n\nOutput:\n1: 0000000000\n2: 0000000000\n3: 0000000000\n4: 0000004000\n5: 0000004000\n6: 3330044000\n7: 0000000000\n8: 3333044400\n9: 3300004400\n10:3300004000\n\nObservations: In input, row3 is \"0333300333\". In output, row6 is \"3330044000\" (notice digits \"3\", \"3\", \"3\", \"0\", \"0\", \"4\", \"4\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\"). Row4 input \"0330000000\" becomes row8 output \"3333044400\"? There's rearrangement.\n\nMaybe rule: It might be splitting the grid into two halves or something. Look at digit \"3\": originally in row3 input, they appear at col2, col3, col4, col5, col6 (maybe?) Actually check row3: \"0333300333\". Positions: col1=0, col2=3, col3=3, col4=3, col5=3, col6=0, col7=0, col8=3, col9=3, col10=3. In output, row6 and row7+? Actually, row6: \"3330044000\" has 3's at col1, col2, col3 then zeros then \"444000\" maybe not.\n\nMaybe rule: \"color inversion\" but digits are not complementary? Wait, maybe each example corresponds to a rule that involves \"reflection\" of specific groups relative to the center. They might be mapping coordinates: x -> something.\n\nLet's check Eg. 3:\n\nEg. 3 Input:\n1: 0000000000\n2: 8800004000\n3: 8000444400\n4: 8880004000\n5: 0000000000\n6: 0000044440\n7: 0008800000\n8: 0088880000\n9: 0000000000\n10:0000000000\n\nOutput:\n1: 0000000000\n2: 0000000000\n3: 0000000000\n4: 0000000000\n5: 0880000000\n6: 8888044440\n7: 0000000000\n8: 8800000400\n9: 8000044440\n10", "prompt_tokens": 885, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's denote them row by row, note positions that changed. I'll re-read the lines carefully:\n\nRow 1: input: \"000000000000000000000\", output: same. So row1 unchanged.\nRow 2: input: \"000002222222000000000\", output: \"000002222222000000000\". unchanged? Actually check: input \"000002222222000000000\", output \"000002222222000000000\"  Wait, check carefully: Input row2: \"000002222222000000000\", Output row2: \"000002222222000000000\"? Actually in provided output, row2 is exactly same. Actually wait, look at provided output row2: \"000002222222000000000\" Yes.\nRow 3: input: \"000002000502000000000\", output: \"000002888882000000000\". Differences: \"000002\" same then \"000\" remains? Let's check carefully: Input row3: \"000002000502000000000\". Output row3: \"000002888882000000000\". So pattern: \"000002\" then \"888\" vs \"000\" then \"502\"? Let's check: Input: digits: \"0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"? Possibly there is pattern replacement: \"502\" becomes \"888\". Wait, let's find differences in digits:\nSegment: input row3: \"000002 000502000000000\"? Actually, let's count columns: 20 characters. Actually, check carefully: The grid is 20 columns. Row3 input: \"000002000502000000000\". Count: \n0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:2, 6:0,7:0,8:0,9:5,10:0,11:2, 12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:0.\nOutput row3: \"000002888882000000000\". Count:\n0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:2,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:2, 12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:0.\nSo difference: The segment from column 6 to column 10 changed from \"00050\" to \"88888\" except last digit remains \"2\"? Wait, let's compare: Input columns: \ncol6:0, col7:0, col8:0, col9:5, col10:0,\nOutput: col6:8, col7:8, col8:8, col9:8, col10:8, and then col11 in input is 2, output col11 is 2. So pattern: a group of five consecutive digits \"00050\" become \"88888\". But then what does that mean? Perhaps the rule: Replace groups of numbers with a certain transformation? \nWe also see in row 4: input \"000222080002000000000\", output \"000222888882000000000\". Compare row4:\nInput row4: \"000222080002000000000\". Output row4: \"000222888882000000000\". So similarly, segment \"080002\" becomes \"888882\"? Let's check: input row4: columns:\n\"000222\" then \"080002\" then \"000000000\"? Actually, let's count: row4 input: \"000222080002000000000\". Break into groups: \"000222\" (first 6 digits), then \"080002\" (next 6 digits?) Actually count: digits: 0,0,0,2,2,2, 0,8,0,0,0,2, then \"000000000\". Wait, let's carefully count row4 input:\n\"000222080002000000000\" (20 characters)\nIndices:\n0:0,1:0,2:0,3:2,4:2,5:2, 6:0,7:8,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:2, 12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:0.\nOutput row4: \"000222888882000000000\", indices:\n0:0,1:0,2:0,3:2,4:2,5:2, 6:8,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:8,11:2, then same tail \"000000000\".\nSo pattern: The segment \"080002\" turned into \"888882\". Compare: input segment digits: [0,8,0,0,0,2] becomes [8,8,8,8,8,2]. So rule: Except the first and last digit remain same? Actually, check: In row3: segment \"000502\" becomes \"888882\"? Let's recalc: row3 segment \"000502\" digits: 0,0,0,5,0,2 becomes 8,8,8,8,8,2. In row4: \"080002\" becomes 8,8,8,8,8,2. So it seems that rule: In a contiguous block that has first digit and last digit possibly remain same? Let's check row5: input \"000200000222000000000\", output \"000288888222000000000\". Let's break row5 input: \"000200000222000000000\". Count columns: digits: \"000200000222000000000\". Compare with output: \"000288888222000000000\". So the difference: It becomes \"000288888222000000000\". So segment \"200000222\" becomes \"288888222\"? Let's check: input row5: \nSegment: \"000200000222000000000\". Possibly break into parts: \"0002\" then \"0000222\" then \"000000000\". Actually, let's align columns: Row5 input: columns:\n0:0,1:0,2:0,3:2,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:2,11:2,12:2, then rest zeros.\nOutput row5: \"000288888222000000000\". Compare digits: \ncol0:0, col1:0, col2:0, col3:2, col4:8, col5:8, col6:8, col7:8, col8:8, col9:8, col10:2, col11:2, col12:2, then zeros.\nSo what changed? The block \"200000222\" (starting at col3? Actually, check: row5 input: at col3 we have 2, then col4:0, col5:0,", "prompt_tokens": 1449, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The input grid is 16 rows by 16 columns (each row is 16 digits). The transformation is not a full copy of some selected rows? Let's see rows that changed.\n\nRow 3 in input (0-indexed 2) is \"001010020033300\", output row 3 is \"000000300000000\". row 4 input \"001110222003000\", output row 4 is \"000003330000000\". row 5 input \"000000000000000\", output row 5 is \"000000300000000\". row 6 input \"555555555555555\", output row 6 is \"000001110000000\". row 7 input \"000000000000000\", output row 7 is \"000001010000000\". row 8 input \"000001110000000\", output row 8 is \"000001110000000\". row 9 input \"000000000000000\", output row 9 is \"000000000000000\".\n\nWait, let's check row numbering: The input is 16 rows, but the output is 10 rows. So it appears that the transformation reduces from a 16x16 grid to a 10x16 grid. Possibly the transformation extracts a specific region from input grid and then modifies it. Let's check coordinates. Possibly the transformation picks out rows 3-8 and columns 3-8? Not sure.\n\nLet's check e.g. 1: The output rows are:\n\nOutput row 1: \"000000000000000\" (row 0 output?) Actually, let's list rows with index:\n\ne.g.1 Output rows:\n\nRow0: \"000000000000000\"\nRow1: \"000000000000000\"\nRow2: \"000000300000000\"\nRow3: \"000003330000000\"\nRow4: \"000000300000000\"\nRow5: \"000001110000000\"\nRow6: \"000001010000000\"\nRow7: \"000001110000000\"\nRow8: \"000000000000000\"\nRow9: There's no row 9, because we have 10 rows total.\n\nWait, count: Actually, the provided e.g.1 Output lines are:\n1. 000000000000000\n2. 000000000000000\n3. 000000300000000\n4. 000003330000000\n5. 000000300000000\n6. 000001110000000\n7. 000001010000000\n8. 000001110000000\n9. 000000000000000\n\nSo output grid is 9 rows (not 10). Let me re-read e.g. 1 output: It says \"E.g. 1 Output:\" followed by 9 lines? Wait, the sample provided in the question: \nE.g. 1 Output:\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000300000000\n000003330000000\n000000300000000\n000001110000000\n000001010000000\n000001110000000\n000000000000000\n\nThat's 9 lines. But the input has 16 lines. So transformation seems to extract some subgrid from input, likely the centered \"object\" in the middle? Perhaps the transformation rule is: \"Take the bottom-most black square from the left part of the grid, and then mirror the pattern?\" Not sure.\n\nLet's analyze coordinates. Consider e.g. 1: Input grid rows (with indices 0 to 15, columns 0 to 15). The output grid rows are 9 rows, presumably corresponding to rows 2 to 10 of input? Let's see: Output row 2 is \"000000300000000\". In the input, row 2 is \"001010020033300\". So maybe the pattern \"300\" came from columns 6-8? Because \"300\" appears at index 6 if we count? Let's check: \"001010020033300\". The substring \"300\" at index 6? Actually, let's check: \"001010020033300\": indices: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:0,4:1,5:0,6:0,7:2,8:0,9:0,10:3,11:3,12:3,13:0,14:0,15:0. So \"300\" appears at indices 12-14? Actually \"300\" is \"3,0,0\". Let's see: The substring \"300\" appears at index 10? Wait, I need to re-read carefully.\n\nI will annotate row 2:\nRow index 2: \"001010020033300\"\nLet's index columns: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:0,4:1,5:0,6:0,7:2,8:0,9:0,10:3,11:3,12:3,13:0,14:0,15:0. Wait, but then \"0333\" appears from index 8? Let's re-read: Actually, the row is \"001010020033300\". I need to break it carefully:\n\n\"00\" then \"1010\" then \"02\" then \"003330\". Let me check: \"001010020033300\" length 16.\nIt might be segmented as: \"00\" (col0-1), \"1010\" (col2-5), \"02\" (col6-7), \"003330\" (col8-13), \"00\" (col14-15). Not sure.\n\nMaybe it's easier: I see digits: 0,0,1,0,1,0,0,2,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0.\nSo the digits are: index:0:0, 1:0, 2:1, 3:0, 4:1, 5:0, 6:0, 7:2, 8:0, 9:0, 10:3, 11:3, 12:3, 13:0, 14:0, 15:0.\nNow in output row \"000000300000000\", digits: index:0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:3,7:0,8:0,9:0, ... rest zeros.\nSo the \"3\" came from column 6? Not sure.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to take a certain central block from the input grid and then reflect it vertically or horizontally. Let's check e.g. 1: Which rows in the input become non-zero in output? Output rows that are non-zero: row2 has \"300\" starting at column 6? Actually, row2 in output \"000000300000000\" has \"300\" starting at column 6? Because indices 0-5 are 0, index6 is 3, index7 is 0, index8 is 0.\nRow3 output \"000003330000000\" has \"333\" starting at column 6? Because digits: index6:3, index7:3, index8:3.\nRow4 output \"000000300000000\" again \"300\" at col6.\nRow5 output \"000001110000000\" has \"111\" (three ones) starting at col6.\nRow6 output \"000001010000000\" has \"101\" starting at col6.\nRow7 output \"000001110000000\" has \"111\" starting at col6.\nRow8 output \"000000000000000\" is all zeros.\n\nSo pattern: The transformation seems to take the middle 3 columns of each row from a particular vertical band of the input. They appear to be taken from column indices 6-8 of the input? Because in many examples, the non-zero parts always appear in columns 6-8. But check e.g. 1: In row2, the non-zero part is \"300\", and in row3 it's \"333\". But where do these come from in the input? Let's inspect input row2: \"001010020033300\". The central 3 columns (columns 6,7,8) are: column6 = \"0\", column7 = \"2\", column8 = \"0\". That would yield \"", "prompt_tokens": 1101, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's re-read the problem statement. It says:\n\"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\"\n\nWe are provided three example pairs: e.g. 1, e.g. 2, e.g. 3, and then a test input grid. I need to deduce transformation rule from these examples.\n\nLet me list them clearly:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\nRow1: \"1034\"\nRow2: \"0021\"\nRow3: \"2140\"\nRow4: \"0312\"\nOutput:\nRow1: \"1234\"\nRow2: \"3421\"\nRow3: \"2143\"\nRow4: \"4312\"\n\nI need to observe differences between input and output. Let's denote grid as matrix. Let me denote positions as (row, col) with index starting with row 0. Let's rewrite them in grid coordinates for example 1:\n\nInput grid 1:\nRow0: digits: 1,0,3,4\nRow1: 0,0,2,1\nRow2: 2,1,4,0\nRow3: 0,3,1,2\n\nOutput grid 1:\nRow0: 1,2,3,4\nRow1: 3,4,2,1\nRow2: 2,1,4,3\nRow3: 4,3,1,2\n\nObservations: It seems like the transformation is not a simple rotation because row0 remains \"1,0,3,4\" becomes \"1,2,3,4\". Only the second digit changed from 0 to 2, third digit remains same, fourth digit remains same? Let's check further rows: row1 input \"0021\" becomes output \"3421\". That means digits: input: [0,0,2,1] output: [3,4,2,1]. Row2: input \"2140\" becomes output \"2143\". So row2: the fourth digit changed from 0 to 3. Row3: input \"0312\" becomes output \"4312\". That means row3: first digit changed from 0 to 4.\n\nMaybe pattern: It might be that the transformation is to replace zeros with something? But then row0, second digit was 0 replaced with 2. Row1, first digit 0 replaced with 3, row2, fourth digit 0 replaced with 3, row3, first digit 0 replaced with 4. But then row0 second digit replaced 0 with 2, row1 first digit replaced 0 with 3, row2 fourth digit replaced 0 with 3, row3 first digit replaced 0 with 4. Could it be that the rule is to fill the zeros with a digit that is the sum of the row and column indices plus maybe some offset? Let's check positions:\n- For e.g. 1: (0,1): row0 col1 is 0 and becomes 2. (0,1) sum? 0+1=1 maybe plus 1? That equals 2? Wait check: row1: (1,0): 0 becomes 3, 1+0=1 plus 2 equals 3? Row2: (2,3): 0 becomes 3, 2+3=5? 5? That doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe rule is to reflect digits along diagonal? Wait, let me re-read.\n\nI think we need to compare all examples. Let's check e.g. 2:\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\nRow0: \"0423\"\nRow1: \"4102\"\nRow2: \"0340\"\nRow3: \"3014\"\nOutput:\nRow0: \"1423\"\nRow1: \"4132\"\nRow2: \"2341\"\nRow3: \"3214\"\n\nObservations: In e.g. 2, look at row0: input \"0423\" becomes output \"1423\". So digit in row0 col0: 0 becomes 1. Row0 col1: 4 remains 4? Actually check: row0 input \"0423\", output \"1423\". So only first digit changed. Row1: input \"4102\" becomes output \"4132\". Change: row1 col3: 2 becomes 2? Actually check: row1 input \"4102\" becomes output \"4132\": digit at col0 remains 4, col1 remains 1, col2 remains 0, col3 changed from 2 to 2? Actually, wait: \"4102\" -> \"4132\": the difference is the third digit: originally 0, now 3, and the fourth digit: originally 2, now 2. Let me re-read carefully:\n\nE.g. 2 output: \"1423\" \"4132\" \"2341\" \"3214\". Let's align indices:\nRow0: input \"0423\", output \"1423\": only the first digit changed from 0 to 1.\nRow1: input \"4102\", output \"4132\": The difference: second digit: input 0 becomes 3 in output. Actually check: \"4102\" vs \"4132\": compare digit by digit:\ncol0: 4 vs 4, col1: 1 vs 1, col2: 0 vs 3, col3: 2 vs 2.\nRow2: input \"0340\", output \"2341\": differences: col0: 0 becomes 2, col1: 3 remains 3? Actually check: \"0340\" vs \"2341\": col0: 0->2, col1: 3->3, col2: 4->4, col3: 0->1.\nRow3: input \"3014\", output \"3214\": difference: col0: 3->3? Actually \"3014\" vs \"3214\": col0: 3 vs 3, col1: 0->2, col2: 1->1, col3: 4->4.\n\nSo pattern: In e.g. 2, the differences are in positions (row0, col0), (row1, col2), (row2, col0), (row3, col1). Compare with e.g. 1: differences were (row0, col1), (row1, col0), (row2, col3), (row3, col0). E.g. 3:\n\nE.g. 3 Input:\nRow0: \"3021\"\nRow1: \"1000\"\nRow2: \"4302\"\nRow3: \"0143\"\nOutput:\nRow0: \"3421\"\nRow1: \"1234\"\nRow2: \"4312\"\nRow3: \"2143\"\n\nLet's align differences:\nRow0: input \"3021\", output \"3421\": difference at col0: 3->? Actually check: \"3021\" vs \"3421\": col0: 3 vs 3? Actually, no difference in row0? Let's re-read: \"3021\" vs \"3421\": col0: '3' remains '3'? Wait, compare digits: input row0 \"3021\": digits: 3,0,2,1; output row0 \"3421\": digits: 3,4,2,1. So difference at col1: 0 becomes 4.\nRow1: input \"1000\", output \"1234\": differences: row1: digits: input: 1,0,0,0; output: 1,2,3,4. So differences at col1, col2, col3.\nRow2: input \"4302\", output \"4312\": difference: row2: digits: input: 4,3,0,2; output: 4,3,1,2. So difference at col2: 0 becomes 1.\nRow3: input \"0143\", output \"2143\": difference: row3: digits: input: 0,1,4,3; output: 2,1,4,3. So difference at col0: 0 becomes 2.\n\nSo, across examples, the transformation seems to be replacing some zeros with non-zero digits. Let's check: In e.g. 1, the differences: row0 col1: originally 0 becomes 2; row1 col0: originally 0 becomes 3; row2 col3: originally 0 becomes 3; row3 col0: originally 0 becomes 4.\nIn e.g. 2, differences: row0 col0: originally 0 becomes 1; row1 col2: originally 0 becomes 3; row2 col0: originally 0 becomes 2; row3 col1: originally 0 becomes 2.\nIn e.g. 3, differences: row0 col1: originally 0 becomes 4; row1 col1, col2, col3: originally 0 become 2, 3, 4 respectively; row2 col2: originally 0 becomes 1; row3 col0: originally 0 becomes 2.\n\nSo, it is not simply substitution of zeros with a constant digit. In each example, the non-zero digits in output seem to be a permutation of {1,2,3,4}. The grid seems to be 4x4, and each row in output is a permutation of digits 1,2,3,4 (except in e.g. 1 row2: \"2143\"", "prompt_tokens": 505, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Actually let's check: Input row1: positions: index 0:0, 1:8, 2:8, 3:1, 4:8, 5:8, 6:0, 7:8, 8:8, 9:8, 10:1, 11:1, 12:1, 13:1, 14:1, 15:1, 16:1, 17:1, 18:0.\nOutput row1: \"0881110881880111880\": digits: index0 0, index1 8, index2 8, index3 1, index4 1, index5 1, index6 0, index7 8, index8 8, index9 1, index10 8, index11 8, index12 0, index13 1, index14 1, index15 1, index16 8, index17 8, index18 0.\nCompare digit by digit:\n- Index 0 same, 0 vs 0.\n- Index 1:8 equal.\n- Index 2:8 equal.\n- Index 3: input 1, output 1.\n- Index 4: input 8, output 1 (8 becomes 1) changed.\n- Index 5: input 8, output 1 (8 becomes 1)\n- Index 6: input 0, output 0.\n- Index 7: input 8, output 8.\n- Index 8: input 8, output 8.\n- Index 9: input 8, output 1 (8 becomes 1)\n- Index 10: input 1, output 8 (1 becomes 8) swapped?\n- Index 11: input 1, output 8 (1 becomes 8)\n- Index 12: input 1, output 0 (1 becomes 0)\n- Index 13: input 1, output 1 (1 remains 1)\n- Index 14: input 1, output 1 (1 remains 1)\n- Index 15: input 1, output 1 (1 remains 1)\n- Index 16: input 1, output 8 (1 becomes 8)\n- Index 17: input 1, output 8 (1 becomes 8)\n- Index 18: input 0, output 0.\n\nSo the changes: some digits are swapped between 1 and 8? In row1, 8's become 1's and 1's become 8's, but not all. For instance, index4 and index5 changed from 8 to 1, index9 changed from 8 to 1, index10 and index11 changed from 1 to 8, index12 changed from 1 to 0, index16 and index17 changed from 1 to 8. Wait, but then row2 input \"0811180811110111110\" vs output \"0811110811180111180\". Let's compare:\nRow2 input: \"0811180811110111110\": digits: 0,8,1,1,1,8,0,8,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0.\nRow2 output: \"0811110811180111180\": digits: 0,8,1,1,1,1,0,8,1,1,1,8,0,1,1,1,8,8,0.\nComparing: index0 same, index1 same, index2 same, index3 same, index4 same, index5: input 8 vs output 1 (8->1), index6: 0 same, index7: 8 same, index8: input 1 vs output 1, index9: input 1 vs output 1, index10: input 1 vs output 1, index11: input 1 vs output 8 (1->8), index12: input 0 vs output 0, index13: input 1 vs output 1, index14: input 1 vs output 1, index15: input 1 vs output 1, index16: input 1 vs output 8 (1->8), index17: input 1 vs output 8 (1->8), index18: input 0 vs output 0.\nSo pattern: Some digits changed from 8->1 and 1->8, but some digits remain the same. What about row3 input \"0111110111110111110\" vs output \"0111110111110111110\": no change. Row4: input \"0811180111110811110\" vs output \"0111110111110111110\": changed first digit from 0? Wait, row4: input: \"0811180111110811110\": digits: 0,8,1,1,1,8,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,1,1,1,0; Output row4: \"0111110111110111110\": digits: 0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0.\nLet's compare: index0: input 0, output 0; index1: input 8, output 1, so 8 becomes 1; index2: input 1 unchanged; index3: input 1 unchanged; index4:", "prompt_tokens": 1485, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We have three examples and then a final test input. Let's read the examples.\n\nWe have three example pairs:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n```\n0000000000\n0000000000\n0000000000\n0055050000\n0050050000\n0050050000\n0055550000\n0000000000\n0000000000\n0000000000\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0000000000\n0000000000\n2222200000\n0055250000\n0052250000\n0052250000\n0055550000\n0000000000\n0000000000\n0000000000\n```\n\nObserving transformation differences:\n- The input grid is 10x10.\nWe see digits '0' and '5'. In output, some digits changed to '2' and '5' appear.\nLet's examine row transformations:\n\nFor E.g. 1, Input grid lines:\nRow 0: all zeros. Output row0: same zeros.\nRow 1: all zeros.\nRow 2: \"0000000000\" becomes \"2222200000\"? Wait, check: The output row2 is \"2222200000\". But input row2 is \"0000000000\". So why row2 changed? Actually, let\u2019s re-read carefully:\nE.g. 1:\n- Input, row0: \"0000000000\" becomes output row0: \"0000000000\". \n- Input, row1: \"0000000000\" becomes output row1: \"0000000000\".\n- Input, row2: \"0000000000\" becomes output row2: \"2222200000\".\n- Input, row3: \"0055050000\" becomes output row3: \"0055250000\".\n- Input, row4: \"0050050000\" becomes output row4: \"0052250000\".\n- Input, row5: \"0050050000\" becomes output row5: \"0052250000\".\n- Input, row6: \"0055550000\" becomes output row6: \"0055550000\".\n- Input, row7: \"0000000000\" remains same.\n- Input, row8: \"0000000000\" remains same.\n- Input, row9: \"0000000000\" remains same.\n\nObserving differences:\nRow2 changed: originally \"0000000000\" becomes \"2222200000\". So it seems some pattern: maybe turning '0's in a specific region into '2's if they are in the central area? But row2 is not originally region with 5's? Let\u2019s check rows where 5's appear: rows 3 to 6 have segments \"0055050000\" etc. They have changed: row3: \"0055050000\" becomes \"0055250000\". Compare: In row3, input: \"0055050000\" and output: \"0055250000\". The difference is that the third digit from left: originally is '5'? Let's check:\nWe have row3: \"0055050000\". Let's label indices: index0:0, index1:0, index2:5, index3:5, index4:0, index5:5, index6:0, index7:0, index8:0, index9:0.\nOutput row3: \"0055250000\": index0:0, index1:0, index2:5, index3:5, index4:2 instead of 0, index5:5, then rest zeros.\nRow4: \"0050050000\" becomes \"0052250000\": differences: index4 becomes 2.\nRow5: \"0050050000\" becomes \"0052250000\": differences: index4 becomes 2.\n\nAlso row2: \"0000000000\" becomes \"2222200000\": differences: indices 0-4 become '2'?\nWait, check row2: \"0000000000\", then output: \"2222200000\". So indices 0-4 become 2, indices 5-9 remain 0.\n\nRow? Let's check E.g. 2.\nE.g. 2 Input grid:\nRow0: \"0000000000\"\nRow1: \"0000000000\"\nRow2: \"0000000000\"\nRow3: \"0005055000\"\nRow4: \"0005005000\"\nRow5: \"0005005000\"\nRow6: \"0005005000\"\nRow7: \"0005555000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\nE.g. 2 Output grid:\nRow0: \"0000000000\"\nRow1: \"0000000000\"\nRow2: \"0000222222\"\nRow3: \"0005255000\"\nRow4: \"0005225000\"\nRow5: \"0005225000\"\nRow6: \"0005225000\"\nRow7: \"0005555000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nLet's compare differences:\nRow2: \"0000000000\" becomes \"0000222222\". So indices 3 to 7 become 2? Actually, \"0000222222\", positions: index0=0, index1=0, index2=0, index3 becomes 2, index4=2, index5=2, index6=2, index7=2, index8=2, index9=2? Wait, count: \"0000222222\" is 10 digits? Let's count: \"0000222222\": digits: index0:0, index1:0, index2:0, index3:0? Wait, check: \"0000222222\" if we group: \"0000\" then \"22222\" then \"2\"? That doesn't match. Let's count manually: \"0000222222\" - \n- There are 10 characters.\nDigit by digit:\n- Index0: '0'\n- Index1: '0'\n- Index2: '0'\n- Index3: '0'\n- Index4: '2'\n- Index5: '2'\n- Index6: '2'\n- Index7: '2'\n- Index8: '2'\n- Index9: '2'\nSo row2 changes indices 4-9 become 2. But previous example row2 changed indices 0-4 become 2. So the pattern might be different per example, might be based on location relative to the 5's region.\n\nLet's check row3 in E.g.2:\nRow3: \"0005055000\" becomes \"0005255000\". Compare: difference at index? Let's index row3: \"0005055000\": digits: 0,0,0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0.\nOutput: \"0005255000\": digits: 0,0,0,5,2,5,5,0,0,0.\nSo index 4 becomes 2. Row4: \"0005005000\" becomes \"0005225000\": difference: index4 becomes 2, index? Actually, let's check row4: \"0005005000\": digits: 0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0.\nOutput row4: \"0005225000\": digits: 0,0,0,5,2,2,5,0,0,0.\nSo row4: index4 becomes 2 and index5 becomes 2.\nRow5: \"0005005000\" becomes \"0005225000\": same changes.\nRow6: \"0005005000\" becomes \"0005225000\": same changes.\nRow7 remains same.\n\nE.g. 3 Input:\n```\n0000000000\n0000000000\n0505500000\n0500500000\n0500500000\n0555500000\n0000000000\n0000055050\n0000050050\n0000055550\n```\nE.g. 3 Output:\n```\n0000000000\n0022222222\n0525500000\n0522500000\n0522500000\n0555500000\n2222222200\n0000055250\n0000052250\n0000055550\n```\nLet's analyze row by row:\n\nRow0: \"0000000000\" -> \"0000000000\" unchanged.\nRow1: \"0000000000\" -> \"0022222222\": so row1 all become 2 except first digit remains 0? Actually, \"0022222222\": index0:0, indices 1 to 9: 2.\nRow2: \"0505500000\" -> \"0525500000\": difference: index? Let's index: row2: digits: 0,5,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0. Output: \"0525500000\": digits: 0,5,2,5,5,0,0,0,0,0. So index2 becomes 2.\nRow3: \"0500500000\" -> \"0522500000\": original: 0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0; output: 0,5,2,2,5,0,0,0,0,0 so indices 2 and 3 become 2.\nRow4: \"0500500000\" -> \"0522500000\": same change.\nRow5: \"055550", "prompt_tokens": 771, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Count digits: \nI count: \"11 0110 1101 1011 011\" no, let's count: Possibly each row is 18 digits long? Wait, let's count manually: \n\"1\" \"1\" \"0\" \"1\" \"1\" \"0\" \"1\" \"1\" \"0\" \"1\" \"1\" \"0\" \"1\" \"1\" \"0\" \"1\" \"1\" \"0\" \"1\" \"1\"? That would be 20 digits.

The transformation seems to turn some patterns into new ones. There is a pattern: The grid is composed of blocks separated by rows of zeros. In E.g. 1, we see the grid is 20 rows, where rows 1-2 are identical, then row3 is zeros, then rows4-5 are identical, then row6 is zeros, then rows7-8 have a \"2\" in a certain place, then row9 zeros, then rows10-11 same as original, row12 zeros, rows13-14 same, row15 zeros, rows16-17 same, row18 zeros, rows19-20 same. Wait, let me re-read the structure:\nE.g. 1 Input:\n\nRow1: 11011011011011011011\nRow2: 11011011011011011011\nRow3: 00000000000000000000\nRow4: 11011011011011011011\nRow5: 11011011011011011011\nRow6: 00000000000000000000\nRow7: 11011022011011011011\nRow8: 11011022011011011011\nRow9: 00000000000000000000\nRow10: 11011011011011011011\nRow11: 11011011011011011011\nRow12: 00000000000000000000\nRow13: 11011011011011011011\nRow14: 11011011011011011011\nRow15: 00000000000000000000\nRow16: 11011011011011011011\nRow17: 11011011011011011011\nRow18: 00000000000000000000\nRow19: 11011011011011011011\nRow20: 11011011011011011011\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n\nRow1: 11011022011011011011\nRow2: 11011022011011011011\nRow3: 00000000000000000000\nRow4: 11011022011011011011\nRow5: 11011022011011011011\nRow6: 00000000000000000000\nRow7: 22022022022022022022\nRow8: 22022022022022022022\nRow9: 00000000000000000000\nRow10: 11011022011011011011\nRow11: 11011022011011011011\nRow12: 00000000000000000000\nRow13: 11011022011011011011\nRow14: 11011022011011011011\nRow15: 00000000000000000000\nRow16: 11011022011011011011\nRow17: 11011022011011011011\nRow18: 00000000000000000000\nRow19: 11011022011011011011\nRow20: 11011022011011011011\n\nObserving differences: In E.g. 1, the transformation changes some rows from \"11011011011011011011\" to \"11011022011011011011\" in rows 1-2 become \"110110220...\" in output, and rows 4-5 also become \"110110220...\", rows 7-8 become \"22022022022022022022\", etc. In addition, row 7 input was \"11011022011011011011\" already. But in output row 7 is \"22022022022022022022\". So it seems the transformation rule might be \"increase every other block\" or \"add a certain value to some cells\" or \"replace certain pattern with a different pattern\". Let's analyze pattern: The original input digits are 1s and 0s and sometimes 2s appear. The output digits are 1s, 2s, and 0s. It looks like the rule is adding 1 to some cells possibly. Check row 1: Input row1: 11011011011011011011. Output row1: 11011022011011011011. Compare column by column:\n- Column 1: input \"1\", output \"1\": no change.\n- Column 2: input \"1\", output \"1\": no change.\n- Column 3: input \"0\", output \"0\": no change.\n- Column 4: input \"1\", output \"1\": no change.\n- Column 5: input \"1\", output \"1\": no change.\n- Column 6: input \"0\", output \"0\": no change.\n- Column 7: input \"1\", output \"1\": no change.\n- Column 8: input \"1\", output \"1\": no change.\n- Column 9: input \"0\", output \"0\": no change.\n- Column 10: input \"1\", output \"1\": no change.\n- Column 11: input \"1\", output \"1\": no change.\n- Column 12: input \"0\", output \"", "prompt_tokens": 1207, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Compare input and output line by line differences:\n\nLine1: same. Line2: same. Line3: same. Line4: same.\n\nLine5: Input: 001201021002001208021, Output: 001208021002001208021.\nComparing: input: \"001201021002001208021\", output: \"001208021002001208021\".\nDifference: positions? Wait, what changed? Let's check: first 3 digits \"001\" remain same. Then next digits: input \"201\" vs output \"208\"? Let's check carefully:\nInput: 001201021002001208021\nBreak into segments maybe \"001 201 021 002 001 208 021\". Output: 001 208 021 002 001 208 021.\nSo difference: \"201\" changed to \"208\". Similarly, line6: input: 111211121112111288821, output: 111288821112111288821.\nBreak segments: maybe \"111 211 121 112 111 288 821\" vs \"111 288 821 112 111 288 821\". So the pattern: It seems that in these rows, the segment in columns corresponding to the \"middle block\" (the third block? Actually, let's check line 5: It might be that the transformation affects the \"center\" of the grid? But the grid is not square in these examples? Actually, let's count digits: Each line has length 21 digits? Actually, 21 digits per line in E.g. 1. Let\u2019s count: \"001201021002001201021\" is 21 digits. They are arranged in a 21x? Actually count rows: There are 21 rows. So maybe the grid is 21x21? But wait, no: Each line is 21 digits. And there are 21 rows. So it's a square 21x21 grid.\n\nBut then look at changes: In E.g. 1, the transformation seems to be applied to certain rows? Look at rows 5,6,7, then skip some, then rows 17,18,19? But output: row5 becomes \"001208021002001208021\". Row6 becomes \"111288821112111288821\". Row7 is same as row5? Actually, check row7: Input row7: \"001201021002001208021\", Output row7: \"001208021002001208021\". So row5 and row7 changed similarly. Then row17: Input: \"001201021002001201021\", Output: \"001208021002001208021\". Row18: Input: \"111211121112111211121\", Output: \"111288821112111288821\". Row19: Input: \"001201021002001201021\", Output: \"001208021002001208021\".\n\nSo pattern: It seems that in some rows, the segment \"201\" becomes \"208\" and \"288\" becomes \"288\"? Wait, let's check row6: \"111211121112111288821\", output \"111288821112111288821\". The transformation seems to be that in a specific block, the digits change from 1 to 8? But not exactly. Let's analyze by columns.\n\nMaybe the rule involves a pattern in the middle column or row. Alternatively, maybe it involves a pattern of \"flip\" or \"rotate\" certain digits by adding 7 (like 1 becomes 8, 0 becomes 8? But not consistent). Let's examine row5: \"001201021002001201021\" vs \"001208021002001208021\". The difference: The substring \"201\" changed to \"208\" in two occurrences. Which occurrences? Let's check indices: The string \"001201021002001201021\". If we index positions 1-indexed: positions: 1-3: \"001\", positions 4-6: \"201\", positions 7-9: \"021\", positions 10-12: \"002\", positions 13-15: \"001\", positions 16-18: \"201\", positions 19-21: \"021\". In output: \"001208021002001208021\". The changed segments: positions 4-6 become \"208\" instead of \"201\", and positions 16-18 become \"208\" instead of \"201\". So it seems that in row5, the segments corresponding to the second and sixth segments (if we break into 7 segments of 3 digits) changed the last digit from 1 to 8. And row6: \"111211121112111288821\": segments: 1-3: \"111\", 4-6: \"211\", 7-9: \"121\", 10-12: \"112\", 13-15: \"111\", 16-18: \"288\", 19-21: \"821\". In output, segments: 1-3: \"111\", 4-6: \"288\", 7-9: \"821\", 10-12: \"112\", 13-15: \"111\", 16-18: \"288\", 19-21: \"821\". So transformation: segment 2 becomes \"288\" instead of \"211\", and segment 7 becomes \"821\" instead of \"121\"? Wait, check: Actually, row6 input: \"111211121112111288821\". Let's re-read carefully:\nRow6 input: \"111211121112111288821\". I will segment into 3-digit groups: \"111\", \"211\", \"121\", \"112\", \"111\", \"288\", \"821\". And output row6: \"111288821112111288821\". So segments: group1 remains \"111\". Group2: \"211\" becomes \"288\". Group3: \"121\" becomes \"821\". Group4: \"112\" remains \"112\". Group5: \"111\" remains \"111\". Group6: \"288\" remains \"288\". Group7: \"821\" remains \"821\".\n\nSo row5 changed groups 2 and 6 by adding 7 to the last digit: For group2: \"201\" becomes \"208\" (last digit changed 1->8) and group6: \"201\" becomes \"208\". Row6 changed groups 2 and 3 (and possibly group ? Let's check row6: Actually, segments: group2 \"211\" becomes \"288\" (last digit 1 becomes 8) and group3 \"121\" becomes \"821\" (first digit 1 becomes 8?) Not so consistent.\n\nWait, let's try to find pattern: Could it be that the rule is to \"", "prompt_tokens": 1679, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The examples are not trivial, but we are given several examples. We need to analyze. The problem statement: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" So we have e.g. 1 input and e.g. 1 output, e.g. 2 input and output, e.g. 3 input and output, etc. We need to deduce the rule from these examples.\n\nLet's denote these examples as E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, then test input at the end. The pattern might be described by some transformation: possibly a reduction in grid shape, e.g. from 12 rows of 11 columns in E1 input? Let's check: E1 input has 15 lines? Wait, check E1: \"E.g. 1 Input:\" shows:\n22202202202\n20000222000\n02222022022\n20122200820\n00200202000\n12200280002\n00000020222\n00212000280\n02001222028\n02022022200\n20020002020\n21222228220\n22202002002\n00202022220\n\nSo E.g. 1 input is 14 lines? Actually count lines: There are 14 lines given in E.g. 1 Input. Each line length: \"22202202202\" length=11, so grid is 14x11. The output E.g. 1 Output is 5 lines of \"22200\", \"22002\", \"20002\", \"22202\", \"22222\", each of which is length 5. So the transformation from a grid of size 14x11 to a grid of size 5x5. \n\nE.g. 2 input is 4 lines. Lines: \"20000200022\", \"22002002020\", \"21020000280\", \"00000000200\". Each line length: 11. And output E.g. 2 Output is \"0200002\", which is a single line? Wait, check E.g. 2 output: \"0200002\" is a single line of length 7? Wait, but maybe we misinterpret. Possibly the outputs are arrays of numbers? Let's check all examples:\n\nE.g. 1 Input: It shows 14 rows (I'll count them carefully): \n1) 22202202202\n2) 20000222000\n3) 02222022022\n4) 20122200820\n5) 00200202000\n6) 12200280002\n7) 00000020222\n8) 00212000280\n9) 02001222028\n10) 02022022200\n11) 20020002020\n12) 21222228220\n13) 22202002002\n14) 00202022220\n\nOutput E.g. 1 Output: 5 rows:\n1) 22200\n2) 22002\n3) 20002\n4) 22202\n5) 22222\n\nSo, transformation: input grid 14x11 becomes output grid 5x5. E.g. 2 Input: There are 4 rows, each 11 columns. Output E.g. 2 Output: \"0200002\" is a single row of length 7. Wait, check: \"0200002\" length = 7. So transformation: 4x11 input to single row of length 7? That is odd. E.g. 3 Input: There are 5 rows, each 10 columns maybe? Let's check: \"2200220220\" length = 10, \"1020802000\" length = 10, \"2200020002\" length = 10, \"2020012008\" length = 10, \"2200220220\" length = 10. Output E.g. 3 Output: \"020\" (line1) and \"200\" (line2). So transformation: 5x10 input to 2x? But output lines \"020\" and \"200\" are length 3. So 2 rows of 3 columns.\nE.g. 4 Input: There are 7 rows, each row length: \"202200020022\" length=12, \"201202080202\" length=12, \"122228200020\" length=12, \"200022202200\" length=12, \"221022282022\" length=12, \"200202022200\" length=12. Output E.g. 4 Output: 3 rows, each \"2020\", \"2222\", \"0222\". So transformation: 7 rows x 12 columns to 3 rows x 4 columns.\nE.g. 5 Input: There are 9 rows, each row length: \"120200082002\" length=12, \"120202080002\" length=12, \"102202280022\" length=12, \"220000220022\" length=12, \"022000002220\" length=12, \"022220000022\" length=12, \"020200202022\" length=12, \"200200222000\" length=12. Output E.g. 5 Output: 3 rows, each \"202000\", \"202020\", \"022022\". So transformation: 9x12 to 3x6.\n\nWe are asked to apply the rule to the test input grid. Let's count test input grid rows: \nTest Input:\n20102022820000\n22200002200002\n01022028200002\n02100000822022\n20202022022200\n01220008022222\n20002200202220\n22221002008022\n00002002200022\n\nCount rows: There are 9 rows (line count: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9). Each row length: Let's check: first row \"20102022820000\" length: count digits: \"20 1020228 20000\"? Let's count: characters: 1:2, 2:0, 3:1, 4:0, 5:2, 6:0, 7:2, 8:2, 9:8, 10:2, 11:0, 12:0, 13:0, 14:0? Let's count carefully: \"20102022820000\" if I count: \n2 (1), 0 (2), 1 (3), 0 (4), 2 (5), 0 (6), 2 (7), 2 (8), 8 (9), 2 (10), 0 (11), 0 (12), 0 (13), 0 (14). So test input grid is 9 rows and 14 columns.\n\nNow look at transformation sizes in examples:\nE.g. 1: Input: 14 rows x 11 columns? Wait, re-check E.g. 1: 14 rows, 11 columns output: 5 rows x 5 columns. E.g. 2: Input: 4 rows x 11 columns, output: 1 row x 7 columns. E.g. 3: Input: 5 rows x 10 columns, output: 2 rows x 3 columns. E.g. 4: Input: 7 rows x 12 columns, output: 3 rows x 4 columns. E.g. 5: Input: 9 rows x 12 columns, output: 3 rows x 6 columns.\n\nTest input: 9 rows x 14 columns. So we need to guess the transformation rule from these examples. Possibly the transformation rule might be reading some values at intersections, maybe summing, maybe taking diagonals? It might be taking some columns and rows. Look at dimensions change: E.g. 1: from 14x11 to 5x5. E.g. 2: from 4x11 to 1x7. E.g. 3: from 5x10 to 2x3. E.g. 4: from 7x12 to 3x4. E.g. 5: from 9x12 to 3x6.\n\nMaybe the output dimensions are computed as: Output rows = (input rows + input columns)/? Let's try to see pattern in e.g.1: 14 rows, 11 columns. Output is 5 rows, 5 columns. e.g.2: 4 rows, 11 columns, output is 1 row, 7 columns. e.g.3: 5 rows, 10 columns, output is 2 rows, 3 columns. e.g.4: 7 rows, 12 columns, output is 3 rows, 4 columns. e.g.5: 9 rows, 12 columns, output is 3 rows, 6 columns.\nMaybe the transformation rule involves taking the sum of digits along diagonals? Alternatively, it might be a pattern extraction from the input grid: maybe count transitions between 0 and 1? But digits are not binary? They are digits from 0 to 2 maybe? Actually, digits are in {0,1,2} maybe. They are not necessarily binary. They are 0,1,2. \n\nMaybe the transformation rule is about \"rotation\" or \"flip\" or \"morphological operations\" or \"edge detection\"? The numbers in the outputs are sequences of digits that appear to be like \"2\", \"0\", etc. The outputs in examples e.g. 1", "prompt_tokens": 729, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The hidden transformation rule is applied to a given grid from the input examples such that the output grid is produced. We are given several examples (E.g. 1 through E.g. 4) and then a \"Test Input\" grid. The given pair of examples: The E.g. 1, etc. They are given as two sets of grids: One set is the \"input\", and then the corresponding \"output\" that has been produced. However, the provided text: \"E.g. 1 Input:\" followed by several rows representing input. Then \"E.g. 1 Output:\" followed by several rows representing output.\n\nWe need to deduce the transformation rule from the examples. Let's re-read carefully.\n\nWe have examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput grid:\nLine 1: 02200 \nLine 2: 22220 \nLine 3: 00220 \nLine 4: 00220 \nLine 5: 44444 \nOutput grid:\nLine 1: 33330 \nLine 2: 33333 \nLine 3: 00333 \nLine 4: 33330\n\nExample 2:\nInput grid:\nLine 1: 22222 \nLine 2: 00020 \nLine 3: 02022 \nLine 4: 22222 \nLine 5: 44444 \nOutput grid:\nLine 1: 33333 \nLine 2: 33030 \nLine 3: 33033 \nLine 4: 33333\n\nExample 3:\nInput grid:\nLine 1: 00000 \nLine 2: 02220 \nLine 3: 02000 \nLine 4: 22202 \nLine 5: 44444 \nOutput grid:\nLine 1: 33003 \nLine 2: 33333 \nLine 3: 33303 \nLine 4: 33333\n\nExample 4:\nInput grid:\nLine 1: 02002 \nLine 2: 02202 \nLine 3: 00022 \nLine 4: 00220 \nLine 5: 44444 \nOutput grid:\nLine 1: 33303 \nLine 2: 33333 \nLine 3: 00033 \nLine 4: 03330\n\nTest Input:\nLine 1: 02222\nLine 2: 00020\nLine 3: 02000\nLine 4: 22202\nLine 5: 44444\nLine 6: 00100\nLine 7: 00001\nLine 8: 10011\nLine 9: 00001\n\nWait, note: The examples are 5 lines for input and 4 lines for output. But test input has 5+? Let's check: Actually in examples, the input has 5 rows, and output has 4 rows. But now the Test Input has 9 rows. Wait, re-read: The text \"E.g. 1 Input\" shows 5 rows? Let's double-check:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n\"02200\" \n\"22220\" \n\"00220\" \n\"00220\" \n\"44444\"\nThen E.g. 1 Output has 4 rows:\n\"33330\"\n\"33333\"\n\"00333\"\n\"33330\"\n\nSo input grid is 5 rows, output grid is 4 rows.\nBut then E.g. 2 Input:\n\"22222\"\n\"00020\"\n\"02022\"\n\"22222\"\n\"44444\"\nE.g. 2 Output:\n\"33333\"\n\"33030\"\n\"33033\"\n\"33333\"\n\nSimilarly, E.g. 3 and E.g. 4. So pattern: The input grid is 5 rows and the output grid is 4 rows. But now the Test Input is 9 rows. Wait, original text \"Test Input:\" lists 9 rows. But then final line \"00001\" is the 9th row. So maybe the test input is not 5 rows but 9 rows. But then the examples are different. Wait, check again: The given text \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then \"02200\" etc. But the provided examples have five lines. But then the \"Test Input:\" has nine lines. Possibly the structure is: The first 5 rows are the \"source\" grid and the last 4 rows are the \"other\" grid? Or is it that the entire input is 9 rows, but we need to apply transformation rule that might involve a combination of rows? Let's check: In each example, the input has 5 rows and output has 4 rows. But in the test input, there are 9 rows. Possibly the test input is composed of two parts: a top part and a bottom part. Let's re-read the statement: \"The user will provide several pairs of example input grids and their corresponding output grids.\" So each example pair is separate. Then \"Finally, a single test input grid is provided.\" Possibly the test input grid is arranged like the input grid in the examples? But the examples show 5 rows input and 4 rows output. However, the test input grid has 9 rows, not 5. Maybe the test input grid is provided as a single grid with 9 rows? But then what is the transformation rule? Possibly the rule is: Remove the last row (or remove a row) from the input grid, and then apply some transformation. But then the output examples: In E.g. 1, input is 5 rows, output is 4 rows. So rule: \"The bottom row is not copied to the output.\" In E.g. 2, input 5 rows, output is 4 rows. In E.g. 3, input 5 rows, output is 4 rows. In E.g. 4, input 5 rows, output is 4 rows. So maybe the rule is always to remove the bottom row. But then test input has 9 rows. Perhaps the test input is not 5 rows but 9 rows. Perhaps the test input grid is composed of 5 rows of pattern and then additional rows? Let's check: Test Input lines:\n1: 02222\n2: 00020\n3: 02000\n4: 22202\n5: 44444\n6: 00100\n7: 00001\n8: 10011\n9: 00001\n\nI see: There are two distinct parts: first 5 rows seem to be identical to one of the examples? Compare row 1: \"02222\" vs E.g. 1 row 1: \"02200\". Not exactly, but similar? Let's check: E.g. 1 input: row1 \"02200\", test input row1 \"02222\". Row2: In E.g. 1: \"22220\", test input row2: \"00020\". Row3: E.g. 1: \"00220\", test input row3: \"02000\". Row4: E.g. 1: \"00220\", test input row4: \"22202\". Row5: E.g. 1: \"44444\", test input row5: \"44444\". So test input rows 1-5 are similar to E.g. 1 except row1 difference (02222 vs 02200), row2 (00020 vs 22220), row3 (02000 vs 00220), row4 (22202 vs 00220). And then additional rows: row6: \"00100\", row7: \"00001\", row8: \"10011\", row9: \"00001\". Perhaps the structure is: The input grid is composed of two parts: a \"pattern\" part (first 5 rows) and a \"target\" part (last 4 rows) that need to be transformed? But wait, the examples: They had 5 rows input and 4 rows output. The test input has 9 rows. Possibly the test input is a concatenation of two grids: one grid that is the \"template\" and one grid that is the \"mask\" or something. Alternatively, maybe the rule is: The transformation takes the upper part of the grid (first 5 rows) and produces a 4-row output by some operation on these 5 rows, and then the remaining rows (6th to 9th) are the \"filler\" that should be processed similarly? Alternatively, maybe the test input is simply a larger grid with 9 rows, and the output grid should also have 9 rows? But the examples show a reduction from 5 rows to 4 rows. Wait, check the examples: They are given as \"E.g. 1 Input:\" followed by 5 lines, and then \"E.g. 1 Output:\" followed by 4 lines. So the pattern is: The output grid is the input grid with the bottom row removed, but then modified numbers: All 2's become 3's? Let's inspect each example.\n\nE.g. 1 Input vs Output:\nInput:\nRow1: 02200 -> Output: 33330. Compare positions:\n- In input, digits are 0,2,2,0,0. In output, digits are 3,3,3,3,0.\nRow2: Input 22220 -> Output: 33333. \nRow3: Input 00220 -> Output: 00333.\nRow4: Input 00220 -> Output: 33330.\nRow5 is \"44444\" and is not included in output.\nSo what transformation? Possibly rule: Remove last row from input, then replace all 2", "prompt_tokens": 618, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We need to deduce rule transformation from examples.\n\nLet's re-read the examples:\n\nE.g. 1 Input: \nLine1: 52525251\nLine2: 25252521\nLine3: 52525251\nLine4: 25252521\nLine5: 52525251\nLine6: 25252521\nLine7: 52525251\nLine8: 11111111\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nLine1: 25252525\nLine2: 52525252\nLine3: 25252525\nLine4: 52525252\nLine5: 25252525\nLine6: 52525252\nLine7: 25252525\nLine8: 52525252\n\nObservations: The transformation appears to be swapping rows? Let's check: Input rows? Actually, let us compare each row input and output:\n\nInput:\nRow1: 52525251, Output: 25252525\nRow2: 25252521, Output: 52525252\nRow3: 52525251, Output: 25252525\nRow4: 25252521, Output: 52525252\nRow5: 52525251, Output: 25252525\nRow6: 25252521, Output: 52525252\nRow7: 52525251, Output: 25252525\nRow8: 11111111, Output: 52525252\n\nI see pattern: In rows 1-7, we have alternating pattern. In input, row1 is \"5 2 5 2 5 2 5 1\" and output is \"2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5\". It appears that the digits alternate except last digit becomes something. Let's check row2: Input row2: \"2 5 2 5 2 5 2 1\", output: \"5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2\". So it looks like the transformation is simply swapping the two alternating digits? Maybe it's \"swap the two colors\" a bit.\n\nWait, let's re-check row1: Input row1: \"5 2 5 2 5 2 5 1\" and output row1: \"2 5 2 5 2 5 2 5\". It seems that the pattern is: every digit gets swapped with the digit that is \"complement\" if it's in a pattern. But note: 5 and 2 are swapped? But then the last digit: input row1 last digit is 1, output row1 last digit is 5. So not exactly swap. Let's check more carefully row8: Input row8: \"1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\", output row8: \"5 2 5 2 5 2 5 2\". So output row8 is not same as row1.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: subtract each cell's digit from 7? Let's check: In row1: digits: 5,2,5,2,5,2,5,1. If we do 7 - digit: then we get: 7-5=2, 7-2=5, 7-5=2, 7-2=5, 7-5=2, 7-2=5, 7-5=2, 7-1=6. That would not equal output row1: [2,5,2,5,2,5,2,6]. But the output is 25252525, not 25252526. So not that.\n\nMaybe transformation is: flip color of row? Let's check differences: In row1, output is the complement of input? Not exactly, because output row1: 2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5. Input row1: 5,2,5,2,5,2,5,1. Compare positions: The first digit: 5 becomes 2. Second digit: 2 becomes 5. Third digit: 5 becomes 2. Fourth digit: 2 becomes 5. Fifth digit: 5 becomes 2. Sixth digit: 2 becomes 5. Seventh digit: 5 becomes 2. Eighth digit: 1 becomes 5. So it appears that the rule is: for every cell, if the cell is 5, change it to 2, if cell is 2, change it to 5. But then what about the 1? That becomes 5. But wait, the output row1 last digit: Input was 1, output is 5. That might be explained if maybe the rule is: if the input is not 5 or 2, then replace it with the digit that is not present? But then row8: all digits are 1, but output row8 is \"5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2\", so it's not simply a swap of two digits. Perhaps the transformation rule is: if the input grid is colored with two colors, then output is the complementary color pattern. Maybe the rule is: if the grid has two colors (5 and 2) then swap them. But row8: all digits are 1, but output row8 is pattern of 5 and 2. That suggests that if the row is uniform (all ones), then we fill it with the alternating pattern that is complementary to the coloring of the top cells? But then row1 is \"5,2,5,2,5,2,5,1\" becomes \"2,5,2,5,2,5,2,5\" i.e. the last digit becomes changed to the opposite of what? In fact, row1: positions 1,3,5,7 are 5, and positions 2,4,6 are 2, and position 8 is 1. Output row1: positions 1,3,5,7 are 2, positions 2,4,6 are 5, and position 8 is 5. So it seems that the transformation is: if cell is 5, then output 2; if cell is 2, then output 5; and if cell is 1, then output 5? But then row2: Input row2: \"2,5,2,5,2,5,2,1\", output row2: \"5,2,5,2,5,2,5,2\". So it seems that the rule is: replace all occurrences of 1 with 5, and swap 5 and 2. But then what about the second example: E.g. 2 \nInput and output. Let's analyze E.g. 2:\nE.g. 2 Input:\nRows:\nRow1: 63576357635888888888 (20 digits?)

{"task_id": "50aad11f", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus:free", "raw_response": "We are given ARC puzzles. There are provided examples: E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3. The transformation rule is hidden. And they are provided as sequences of lines representing grids. The first input example, E.g. 1 input and output. They are not necessarily same grid shape? Wait: Let's re-read the problem description carefully:\n\nTask: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" And then it says: \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then \"000000000\" etc. It lists multiple lines. And then \"E.g. 1 Output:\" etc.\n\nWait, careful: The provided text lists several \"E.g. 1\", \"E.g. 2\", \"E.g. 3\" examples. They are sample puzzles. They are not necessarily related. They are separate examples. We need to deduce the transformation rule from the examples. But then \"Test Input:\" is provided. But which example's rule? Possibly the transformation rule is common if ARC puzzles have similar rules.\n\nI need to analyze each example separately to see if we can deduce a transformation rule.\n\nWe have three examples:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n```\n000000000\n006000000\n066660800\n000600000\n006600000\n000000000\n000000000\n000666000\n000600010\n006660000\n000060000\n000000000\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0800\n8888\n0080\n0880\n0111\n0100\n1110\n0010\n```\nObserving: The input grid is 12 lines, each line 9 characters? Wait, check: \"000000000\" is 9 characters. Then \"006000000\" is 9 characters, etc. So input grid is 12 rows x 9 columns.\n\nOutput for E.g. 1 is:\n```\n0800\n8888\n0080\n0880\n0111\n0100\n1110\n0010\n```\nThat output grid is 8 rows x 4 columns.\n\nSo transformation: from a 12x9 grid to an 8x4 grid. That is a reduction. Possibly the rule is to extract some subregions and then perform some mapping of digits? But then E.g. 2: Input grid: lines are 12 lines, each is 15 characters? Let's check: \"00000000000000\" is 15 characters, repeated lines. So input grid is 12x15. Output for E.g. 2 is:\n```\n00030200\n03330200\n33002222\n03330020\n```\nSo output grid is 4 rows x 8 columns. So different output shapes.\n\nE.g. 3: Input grid: Looks like lines are \"000000000000000000\" which is 20 characters. There are 13 lines. Output for E.g. 3 is:\n```\n010003004004\n111133004444\n011003000440\n010033330044\n```\nSo output grid for E.g. 3 is 4 rows x 16 columns.\n\nWe have three examples, each with different input and output sizes. The transformation rule might be \"counting connected groups of non-zero digits\" or \"sum of digits\" or \"pattern extraction\" or \"mirror\" or \"rotate\" or \"shift\" etc.\n\nLet's try to identify patterns.\n\nLooking at E.g. 1:\nInput:\nRow by row with coordinates (r, c) where r=0..11, c=0..8.\nNon-zero digits appear: digits: 6, 8, 0, 1 maybe? Let's see:\n\nWe have input rows:\nRow0: 000000000 all zeros.\nRow1: 006000000: non-zero: digit '6' at col2 maybe? Actually, let's index columns from 0:\nRow1: \"0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0\"\nSo there's a '6' at col2.\n\nRow2: \"066660800\": digits: row2: 0 6 6 6 6 0 8 0 0. So digits: '6' at col1, col2, col3, col4, then '8' at col6.\nRow3: \"000600000\": '6' at col3.\nRow4: \"006600000\": '6' at col2 and col3? Actually \"006600000\": so digits: '6' at col2 and col3.\nRow5: \"000000000\" no non-zero.\nRow6: \"000000000\" no non-zero.\nRow7: \"000666000\": three '6's at col3, col4, col5.\nRow8: \"000600010\": digits: '6' at col3, '1' at col8.\nRow9: \"006660000\": digits: '6's at col2, col3, col4.\nRow10: \"000060000\": digit '6' at col4.\nRow11: \"000000000\" no non-zero.\n\nSo non-zero digits: 6 appears often, 8 appears once, 1 appears once.\n\nOutput:\nRows:\nRow0: \"0800\"\nRow1: \"8888\"\nRow2: \"0080\"\nRow3: \"0880\"\nRow4: \"0111\"\nRow5: \"0100\"\nRow6: \"1110\"\nRow7: \"0010\"\n\nNow, how might the transformation be done? Possibly count contiguous groups of non-zero digits in the input, or maybe sum of positions? The output grid is 8x4. Possibly each cell in output corresponds to a particular region in the input grid. Observing the output, there are digits 0, 8, 1. They are present in the input as well (6, 8, 1) but note that output uses 8 and 1, and also new digit 0. But input had 6's, not 8's, except row2 has an 8. Also row8 had a 1. So transformation might be mapping 6 to 8 and 1 remains 1, and possibly other digits get 0.\n\nI see output: row0 \"0800\" has 8 in first column. Row1 \"8888\" has all 8's. Row2 \"0080\" has 8 in last column. Row3 \"0880\" has 8 in second and third columns. Row4 \"0111\" all ones, row5 \"0100\" a one in second column, row6 \"1110\" three ones then 0, row7 \"0010\" one at third column.\n\nMaybe the rule is to \"rotate\" the input grid? Or maybe the rule is to \"project\" some pattern from the input grid onto a smaller grid where each cell's value is determined by counting the number of certain digits in a subregion of the input grid.\n\nI look at the dimensions: input is 12x9, output is 8x4. Ratio? 12/8=1.5, 9/4=2.25. Not a simple tiling ratio.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Find connected components of non-zero cells in the input, then create a minimal bounding box around them and then fill it with a new digit that is the majority digit in that component, with some exceptions?\" Not sure.\n\nI need to compare structure between input and output. Perhaps the transformation is \"mirror\" along the diagonal? But output grid is smaller shape.\n\nMaybe it's \"reduction\" by taking the \"skeleton\" of the input pattern. Possibly the rule is: \"Replace each maximal rectangle of contiguous non-zero digits with a single digit, and then place that digit in the center of the rectangle in the output grid\"? But then the output grid is 8x4, which is not the same count as the number of rectangles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is \"count the number of non-zero digits in each row segment and then map counts to digits\"? Check row sums in input? But output row \"0800\": sum of row0 in input is 0, so maybe 0 remains 0. Row1: sum is 6 => maybe 6 becomes 8? Row2: sum is 6+6+6+6+8=32, but output \"0080\" has 8 in last column, but that doesn't match sum 32.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise and then crop\"? Let's check: if we rotate the input e.g. 1, we get 9x12 grid. That doesn't match output which is 8x4.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Extract the positions of the non-zero digits and then perform a transformation on their coordinates\"? For instance, look at the positions of non-zero digits in input e.g. 1:\nCoordinates for 6's:\nRow1, col2.\nRow2: col1,2,3,4.\nRow3: col3.\nRow4: col2,3.\nRow7: col3,4,5.\nRow8: col3.\nRow9: col2,3,4.\nRow10: col4.\nRow8: also has a '1' at col8.\nRow2: has an '8' at col6.\n\nNow output digits: They are 8 and 1. Possibly mapping: 6 -> 8, and 8 or 1 remain? But then why output \"8888\" row1", "prompt_tokens": 793, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The first row is identical in input and output. Second row is identical. Third row is identical. Fourth row is identical. Fifth row: Input: \"243204323200888702\". Output: \"243204328200888702\".

Let's compare: char by char:\n\nRow 5 input: 2 4 3 2 0 4 3 2 3 2 0 0 8 8 8 7 0 2? Wait, count digits: Actually the sample string \"243204323200888702\" is length 18 maybe? Let's check: Actually input has 12 rows, each row seems to be 18 characters? Possibly 12x18 grid. Let's check: \"220703270270327003\" is row 1. Count digits: 18 digits?

There are three examples E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, then final test input.\n\nLet's look at E.g. 1.\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n```\n00000000000\n01111001110\n01111001110\n01111001110\n01111000000\n00000000000\n00111110000\n00111110000\n00111110000\n00111110000\n00111110000\n00111110000\n```\nWait careful: Actually sample input lines count: It says E.g. 1 Input:\n```\n00000000000\n01111001110\n01111001110\n01111001110\n01111000000\n00000000000\n00111110000\n00111110000\n00111110000\n00111110000\n00111110000\n00111110000\n```\nWait, count rows: Actually there are 12 rows? Wait let's recalc:\n1: \"00000000000\" (10 columns) \n2: \"01111001110\" (12 columns?) Actually check: \"01111001110\" is 11 characters? Let's count: \"0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0\". That's 11 characters. But then row 1 \"00000000000\" has 10? Wait let's re-read provided sample carefully:\n\nThe E.g. 1 Input lines:\nLine1: 00000000000 -> count: 10 digits.\nLine2: 01111001110 -> count: 11 digits? Let's count: 0,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0 = 11 digits.\nLine3: 01111001110 -> 11 digits.\nLine4: 01111001110 -> 11 digits.\nLine5: 01111000000 -> count: 0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0? Actually \"01111000000\" appears to be 11 digits? Let's count: 0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0 = 11 digits.\nLine6: 00000000000 -> 10 digits? Actually \"00000000000\" is 10 digits.\nLine7: 00111110000 -> count: 0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0? Actually 11 digits\nLine8: 00111110000 -> 11 digits.\nLine9: 00111110000 -> 11 digits.\nLine10: 00111110000 -> 11 digits.\nLine11: 00111110000 -> 11 digits.\nLine12: 00111110000 -> 11 digits.\n\nSo the grid dimensions are inconsistent? Wait, maybe the first line is actually 11 digits but with a leading zero missing? It might be a formatting issue. Let's re-read examples carefully.\n\nMaybe the examples are not necessarily rectangular? Or maybe we don't need exact dimensions. But then E.g. 1 Output:\n```\n00000000000\n01111001110\n01221001210\n01221001110\n01111000000\n00000000000\n00111110000\n00122210000\n00123210000\n00123210000\n00122210000\n00111110000\n```\nComparing Input and Output, we see differences in some rows. Let's compare row by row.\n\nFor E.g. 1, compare row 1: Input \"00000000000\" vs Output \"00000000000\" - no change.\nRow2: Input \"01111001110\" vs Output \"01111001110\" - no change.\nRow3: Input \"01111001110\" vs Output \"01221001210\". So row3 changed.\nRow4: Input \"01111001110\" vs Output \"01221001110\". Row3 and row4 changed. \nRow5: Input \"01111000000\" vs Output \"01111000000\" unchanged.\nRow6: Input \"00000000000\" vs Output \"00000000000\" unchanged.\nRows 7-12: They are similar pattern with changes in the middle digits.\n\nLet's try to detect pattern in row3 of E.g.1:\nInput row3: \"01111001110\"\nOutput row3: \"01221001210\"\nMapping positions? Write indices (starting from 0):\nInput: positions: 0:0, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:0, 6:0, 7:1, 8:1, 9:1, 10:0.\nOutput: positions: 0:0, 1:1, 2:2, 3:2, 4:1, 5:0, 6:0, 7:1, 8:2, 9:1, 10:0.\nSo changes: index2 changed from 1 to 2, index3 changed from 1 to 2, index4 changed from 1 to 1? Actually check carefully: \nIndices: \n- index0: remains 0\n- index1: remains 1\n- index2: was 1 becomes 2\n- index3: was 1 becomes 2\n- index4: was 1 becomes 1? But output shows \"01221001210\", so character at index4 is \"1\"? Let's recalc: Actually, \"01221001210\", let's index:\n0:0, 1:1, 2:2, 3:2, 4:1, 5:0, 6:0, 7:1, 8:2, 9:1, 10:0.\nSo indeed index2 becomes 2, index3 becomes 2, index4 remains 1.\nBut then look at row4:\nInput row4: \"01111001110\" and output row4: \"01221001110\". So indices: \n0:0,1:1,2:2,3:2,4:1,5:0,6:0,7:1,8:1,9:1,10:0.\nSo row3 and row4 have similar pattern modifications: indices 2 and 3 become 2 instead of 1. \nWait, but then row? Let's check row7 in E.g.1:\nInput row7: \"00111110000\"\nOutput row7: \"00111110000\" (line 7 of output is \"00111110000\", check sample: Actually given sample: row7 of output is \"00111110000\"? Let's re-read the provided sample E.g. 1 Output:\nLine1: 00000000000\nLine2: 01111001110\nLine3: 01221001210\nLine4: 01221001110\nLine5: 01111000000\nLine6: 00000000000\nLine7: 00111110000\nLine8: 00122210000\nLine9: 00123210000\nLine10: 00123210000\nLine11: 00122210000\nLine12: 00111110000.\nSo row7 remains unchanged.\nRow8: Input \"00111110000\" becomes \"00122210000\". That means: \"00111110000\" -> \"00122210000\". Compare indices:\nInput: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0? Wait need to count: \"00111110000\" is 11 digits? Let's check: \"00\" then \"1111\" then \"10000\"? Actually count: if we assume each is 11 digits. Let's index row8:\nIndices: 0:0, 1:0, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 7:0, 8:0, 9:0, 10:0.\nOutput row8: \"00122210000\": indices: 0:0, 1:0, 2:1?, Actually output row8: \"00122210000\", let's index: 0:0, 1:0, 2:1, 3:2, 4:2, 5:2, 6:1, 7:0, 8:0, 9:0, 10:0.\nSo transformation: indices 3,4,5 changed from 1 to 2? Actually check: originally row8: indices: 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1. But output: index2 remains 1, index3 becomes 2, index4 becomes 2, index5 becomes 2, index6 becomes 1.\nRow9: Input \"00111110000\" -> Output \"00123210000\": indices: input: 0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0; output: \"00123210000\": indices: 0:0,1:0,2:1,3:2,4:3,5:2,6", "prompt_tokens": 970, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The task is to deduce the transformation rule from example pairs.\n\nLet's re-read the examples:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n0005000\n0005000\n0005000\n0005000\n0005000\n0000000\n0000000\n0000000\n0000000\n0000000\n0000000\n0000000\n0000000\n0000000\n\nSo there are 14 lines? Let's check: lines: 1st line \"0005000\", then 2nd line \"0005000\", then 3rd \"0005000\", then 4th \"0005000\", then 5th \"0005000\", then 6th \"0000000\", then 7th \"0000000\", then 8th \"0000000\", then 9th \"0000000\", then 10th \"0000000\", then 11th \"0000000\", then 12th \"0000000\", then 13th \"0000000\", then 14th \"0000000\". So grid size: 14 rows, each row length 7 columns.\n\nOutput:\n8885660\n8885600\n8885600\n8885000\n8885000\n8880000\n8880000\n8800000\n8800000\n8000000\n8000000\n0000000\n0000000\n0000000\n\nObserving example: The input has a block of rows from row1 to row5 with \"0005000\". Then rows 6 to 14 are all zeros.\n\nThe output replaced these with numbers: row1 becomes \"8885660\", row2 \"8885600\", row3 \"8885600\", row4 \"8885000\", row5 \"8885000\", then row6 \"8880000\", row7 \"8880000\", row8 \"8800000\", row9 \"8800000\", row10 \"8000000\", row11 \"8000000\", row12 \"0000000\", row13 \"0000000\", row14 \"0000000\".\n\nObserving digits: The first digit of row1 is \"8\", then \"8\", then \"8\", then \"8\", then \"8\", then \"5\", then \"6\", then \"0\". In row2: \"8\", \"8\", \"8\", \"5\", \"6\", \"0\", \"0\". In row3: \"8\", \"8\", \"8\", \"5\", \"6\", \"0\", \"0\". In row4: \"8\", \"8\", \"8\", \"5\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\". In row5: \"8\", \"8\", \"8\", \"5\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\". Then row6: \"8\", \"8\", \"8\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\". Row7: \"8\", \"8\", \"8\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\". Row8: \"8\", \"8\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\". Row9: \"8\", \"8\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\". Row10: \"8\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\". Row11: \"8\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\". Then rows 12, 13, 14 remain \"0000000\".\n\nObserving pattern: The input's \"5\" (the digit \"5\") in column 4? Let's see: input rows 1-5: \"0005000\". Actually \"0005000\" positions: columns: \ncol1: 0, col2: 0, col3: 0, col4: 5, col5: 0, col6: 0, col7: 0.\nSo the \"5\" is at column index 4 (if counting from 1) or index 3 if zero-indexing. \n\nNow output rows: For rows 1 to 5, the output has digits \"8885...\" changed. Let's check: row1: digits: 8,8,8,5,6,0.\nRow2: 8,8,8,5,6,0,0.\nRow3: 8,8,8,5,6,0,0.\nRow4: 8,8,8,5,0,0,0.\nRow5: 8,8,8,5,0,0,0.\nRow6: 8,8,8,0,0,0,0.\nRow7: 8,8,8,0,0,0,0.\nRow8: 8,8,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow9: 8,8,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow10: 8,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow11: 8,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRows 12-14 remain zeros.\n\nObserving transformation: It appears that the transformation deals with \"folding\" or \"propagating\" the 5 along diagonals downward? Wait, let's inspect more carefully.\n\nLook at first example: Input: a block of 5 rows with a \"5\" in column 4, then below that all zeros. The output: They filled many rows with numbers. It seems the transformation \"replicates\" the digit \"5\" and \"8\" pattern downward and right, maybe like a diagonal propagation. Notice the pattern: The output rows start with \"888\" then a \"5\", then sometimes \"6\" then zeros. Possibly the rule: The \"5\" digit is replaced by a pattern that extends diagonally downward and to the right, with the numbers decreasing by 1 as they move down the diagonal? Let's see: In row1, we see \"8885 6 0\" (maybe the \"5\" is at column 4, and then a \"6\" appears at column6? In row2, we see \"8885 6 0 0\". In row3, same as row2. In row4 and row5, we see \"8885 0 0 0\". Then row6 and row7: \"8880 0 0 0 0\". Then row8 and row9: \"88 0 0 0 0 0\". Then row10 and row11: \"8 0 0 0 0 0 0\". \n\nWait, let's re-read carefully the output of Example 1:\n\nRows:\n1: \"8885660\"\n2: \"8885600\"\n3: \"8885600\"\n4: \"8885000\"\n5: \"8885000\"\n6: \"8880000\"\n7: \"8880000\"\n8: \"8800000\"\n9: \"8800000\"\n10: \"8000000\"\n11: \"8000000\"\n12: \"0000000\"\n13: \"0000000\"\n14: \"0000000\"\n\nI see the following pattern: The non-zero output appears in rows 1 to 11. They seem to be \"filled\" from top-left corner to some extent. It might be that the transformation is taking the location of the \"5\" in the input (which is at (row i, col j)) and then \"drawing\" an \"L\" shape or something that extends to the top-left corner from that \"5\" and then \"propagates\" downward. Let's examine Example 2:\n\nE.g. 2:\nInput:\n00500000  (row1)\n00500000  (row2)\n00500000  (row3)\n00500000  (row4)\n00000000  (row5)\n00000000  (row6)\n00000000  (row7)\n00000000  (row8)\n00000000  (row9)\n00000000  (row10)\n00000000  (row11)\n\nOutput:\n88560000\n88560000\n88500000\n88500000\n88000000\n88000000\n80000000\n80000000\n00000000\n00000000\n00000000\n\nObserving input: The \"5\" is in column 4 (0-indexing: col3 if count from 0? Actually, let's count: \"00500000\" digits: positions: 0:0, 1:0, 2:5, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0,6:0,7:0?) Wait let's count: \"00500000\" length=8. The digits: index0:0, index1:0, index2:5, index3:0, index4:0, index5:0, index6:0, index7:0. So the \"5\" is at column 3 (if we number columns starting 1, then it's the 3rd column, which is index2 if 0-indexed). \nNow output: row1 becomes \"88560000\" (8,8,5,6,0,0,0,0). row2: same \"88560000\". row3: \"88500000\". row4: \"88500000\". row5: \"88000000\". row6: \"88000000\". row7: \"80000000\". row8: \"80000000\". row9:", "prompt_tokens": 793, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Wait check E.g. 4 output: \"332\" and \"222\". So it appears that each sample has a 2x3 output grid. But the input grids are larger. Let's check dimensions:\nE.g. 1 Input: It appears to be 10 lines of digits. They are all length 20? Actually, count digits: \"8888888888888888888\" has 20 digits. So input grid is 10x20. Output grid is 2 rows x 3 columns. Similarly, E.g. 2: Input grid: 10 rows of 10 digits each. Output grid: 2 rows of 3 digits each. E.g. 3: Input grid: 10 rows of 14 digits? Actually count: \"11111111111111\" is 14 digits, and there are 10 rows. Output grid: 2 rows of 3 digits each. E.g. 4: Input grid: 15 rows of 15 digits? Actually count: \"888888888888888\" is 15 digits, and there are 15 rows? Actually, check E.g. 4 input: It has 15 rows? Let's count: \"888888888888888\" is row 1, row2 is similar, row3 is \"882222888888888\", etc, then output grid: \"332\" and \"222\" but that's only 2 rows and 3 columns. So output grid is always 2x3. Wait, but I must re-read: \"E.g. 1 Output:\" then two lines: \"333\" and \"320\". So output grid is 2 rows, each with 3 characters. Also E.g. 2: \"332\" and \"200\", E.g. 3: \"333\" and \"220\", E.g. 4: \"332\" and \"222\". So the outputs are always 2x3 grids.\n\nWhat is the transformation? Possibly it might be extracting the most frequent digit in some positions? Let's analyze the digits in each example.\n\nI hypothesize that the transformation rule may be: \"Count the number of distinct colored regions or number of certain digits in the grid, then output a 2x3 representation with counts of something.\"\n\nLet's analyze E.g. 1: Input grid digits: There are digits: 8 and 3 and 2 maybe. Let's check E.g. 1 input: The grid is 10x20. The digits used are: 8's, 3's, and 2's? Actually, look: \"8888888888888888888\" (all 8's) in the first row, second row: \"3333338888882222888\" row 2 has 3's, 8's, 2's? Actually, row2: starts with 333333, then 888888, then 2222888? Let's count: row2: \"3333338888882222888\". It has 6 3's, then 6 8's, then \"2222888\"? Wait, let me recount: The digits: \"333333\" (six 3's), \"888888\" (six 8's), \"2222888\" (??? Actually count: after the six 8's, we see \"2222888\". The substring \"222\" then \"888\"? Actually, \"2222888\" is 3 2's followed by 3 8's? Let's count properly: The entire row is 20 digits. It is: \"333333\" (positions 1-6), then \"888888\" (7-12), then \"2222888\" (positions 13-20)? But that would be 8 digits, but we need 8 digits for positions 13-20 equals 8 digits, so \"2222888\" is 8 digits, but that doesn't match the pattern because we already had 6+6 = 12 digits, so remaining digits are 8. But \"2222888\" is 8 digits. It has three 2's and five 8's? Wait, let's count: \"2222888\" digits: first three: 2,2,2, then next four: 2,8,8,8? That would be 3+4=7 digits, not 8. Let's recalc: Actually, \"2222888\" if broken: maybe it's \"222\" then \"2888\"? That would be 3+4=7. Alternatively, maybe it's \"222\" then \"888\"? That gives 3+3=6, but then total becomes 6+6+6=18, not 20. Let me re-read the given text carefully.\n\nThe provided text for E.g. 1 Input is:\n8888888888888888888\n3333338888882222888\n8888888888888888888\n8833333333888888888\n8888888888888888888\n8888888888888833338\n8888833388888888888\n8888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888\n8888888888888888888\n\nMaybe I miscounted. Actually, count digits for each row: The first row is \"8888888888888888888\". How many 8's? Count visually: It might be 20 digits.\nRow2: \"3333338888882222888\". Count digits: \"333333\" = 6, then \"888888\" = 6, then \"2222888\" = 8 digits? Let's count: \"2222888\": if I group as \"2222\" and \"888\", that would be 4+3=7, no.\nMaybe I'll count manually: The string \"3333338888882222888\": I'll count positions:\n1:3\n2:3\n3:3\n4:3\n5:3\n6:3\n7:8\n8:8\n9:8\n10:8\n11:8\n12:8\n13:2\n14:2\n15:2\n16:2? Actually, let's check: after the 6 8's, we have \"2222888\". I suspect it's \"2222\" then \"888\"? That would be", "prompt_tokens": 794, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check columns: each row has 25 digits? Actually count \"0000000000000000000000000\" is 25 zeros? Let's count: \"0000000000000000000000000\" count digits: 25 zeros. Yes.\n\nNow the output for E.g. 1 Output:\nIt is similar grid but changed digits in some places. Let's compare input vs output:\n\nInput:\nRow 1: 0000000000000000000000000 becomes output: 2222222222000000000000000. That is row 1: first 9 digits become 2's? Actually count: output row 1: \"2222222222000000000000000\". How many 2's? Let's count: \"2222222222\" then \"0000000000000000\"? Let's count digits: It is a 25-digit row. In output row 1: first 10 digits? Let's count: \"2222222222\" is 10 digits, then \"0000000000000000\" is 15 digits? Wait, 10+15 = 25.\nCheck row 2: same: \"2222222222000000000000000\".\nRow 3: input: \"0044444400000000000000000\" becomes \"2244444422000000000000000\". Compare: Instead of starting with \"00\", now it's \"22\" then \"4444444\" then \"22000000000000000\" wait, I'll compare carefully.\n\nLet's denote rows:\nFor example 1: We see two distinct regions: one region in the top part and one region in the bottom part.\n\nThe top part of input (rows 1 to 8?) Actually let's see: The first block in input, rows 1-8: They are like pattern with a central plus shape? Actually, let me check:\nRows 1-2: are all zeros. But output row 1-2 becomes all 2's except last digits? Actually, output row 1: \"2222222222\" then zeros.\nRow 3: input \"0044444400000000000000000\" becomes output \"2244444422000000000000000\". So what changed? The first two digits \"00\" became \"22\"? And the last two digits \"00\" became \"22\"? Let's check row 3: original: \"00 444444 0000000000000000\" but output: \"22 444444 2200000000000000\". So the \"00\" at beginning became \"22\" and the \"00\" at end became \"22\". Let's check row 4: input \"0042444400000000000000000\" becomes output \"2242444422000000000000000\". So again, the first two digits \"00\" become \"22\", and the last two digits \"00\" become \"22\". Row 5: input \"0044444400000000000000000\" becomes \"2244444422000000000000000\". Row 6: similar. Row 7: input \"0044424400000000000000000\" becomes \"2244424422000000000000000\". Row 8: \"0044444400000000000000000\" becomes \"2244444422000000000000000\". Then row 9 and 10 and 11 and 12 and 13 and 14 and 15 are zeros remain zeros? Let's check row 9: input \"0000000000000000000000000\" becomes output \"2222222222000000000000000\". Wait, row 9 in output is \"2222222222000000000000000\". But row 9 in input is zeros. So it seems that the transformation is not just replacing zeros with twos, because then row 9 should become all twos, but output row 9 is \"2222222222\" then zeros. Let's check row 10: input row 10 is zeros, output row 10 is \"2222222222000000000000000\". So rows 9 and 10 got a similar transformation as rows 1 and 2. But wait, then row 11: input row 11 is zeros, output row 11 is zeros. Wait, check: Actually, output row 11: \"0000000000000000000000000\" exactly.\nSo it seems the transformation applies to certain blocks, not entire grid uniformly.\n\nLet's look at bottom part: The bottom part in input starts at row 16: \"0000000000000444444440000\" becomes output row 16: \"0000000000000111111111111110\". Wait, check row 16: input \"0000000000000444444440000\", output \"0000000000000111111111111110\". So what changed? The \"4444444\" part becomes \"1111111\" but then extra digits? Let's check row 17: input \"0000000000000444144440000\" becomes output \"0000000000000111444444441110\". So the inner pattern \"444144444\" becomes \"111144444444111\"? Wait, let's check carefully: row 16: input: \"000000000000\" then \"4444444\" then \"0000\"? Actually, let me split each row into segments. Possibly the transformation rule involves \"extracting\" the inner block and then replacing 4's with 1's and 0's remain 0's, and then also putting a border of 1's or 2's? Let's compare row 16 in example 1:\nInput row 16: \"0000000000000444444440000\"\nCount digits: There are 16 digits at start? Actually, it's 25 digits total. Let's mark positions: The first 12 digits are \"000000000000\", then \"4444444\" then \"0000\"? Wait, let me count: \"000000000000\" is 12 zeros, then \"4444444\" is 7 digits? Because 12+7=19, then \"0000\" is 4, total = 12+7+4=23, not 25. Let's count carefully:\nThe given string \"0000000000000444444440000\" length? Count: There are 25 characters total. Let's count manually: \"000000000000\" that's 12 zeros, then \"4444444\" is 7 characters (since \"4444444\" count digits: 4,4,", "prompt_tokens": 2240, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Observe that in all examples, the transformation involves removing specific patterns in certain positions.\n2. Notice that the patterns being removed appear consistently in the input examples.\n3.

Compare each row:\n\nRow1: input: \"033933000000000\", output: \"033933000000000\" - same.\nRow2: input: \"033333039330000\", output: \"033333039330000\" - same.\nRow3: input: \"093393033390000\", output: \"093393033390000\" - same.\nRow4: input: \"000000093930000\", output: \"000000093930000\" - same.\nRow5: input: \"000000033330000\", output: \"000000033330000\" - same.\nRow6: input: \"339000000000000\", output: \"339000000000000\" - same.\nRow7: input: \"933003930003393\", output: \"933000000003393\". So row7 changed: \"933003930003393\" changed to \"933000000003393\". Which columns changed? It might be that the middle block \"03930\" becomes \"00000\"?\nLet's check row7: input row7: \"933003930003393\". Let\u2019s index columns: columns: \n0: 9, 1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 3, 6: 9, 7: 3, 8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 0, 11: 3, 12: 9, 13: 3, 14: 3, 15: 3? Wait count: that string length is 16. Let's check properly:\n\"933003930003393\" length? Count characters: 9,3,3,0,0,3,9,3,0,0,0,3,9,3,3,3? Actually, I'll re-read row7 input: \"933003930003393\". It might be 15 chars? Let's check: Actually, counting: \"9(1) 3(2) 3(3) 0(4) 0(5) 3(6) 9(7) 3(8) 0(9) 0(10) 0(11) 3(12) 9(13) 3(14) 3(15) 3(16)\" so it's 16 digits. Now output row7: \"933000000003393\". Compare:\nInput: 933 003 930 003393? Wait, let's align columns: \nRow7: input: \"933003930003393\"\n         indices: 0 1 2|3 4|5 6 7|8 9 10|11 12 13|14 15? Let's try splitting: maybe not.\nLet's compare positions: \nRow7 input: positions: \n0: 9,1: 3,2: 3, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 3, 6: 9, 7: 3, 8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 0, 11: 3, 12: 9, 13: 3, 14: 3, 15: 3.\nRow7 output: \"933000000003393\": \npositions: 0: 9,1: 3,2: 3, 3: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 0, 7: 0, 8: 0, 9: 0, 10: 0, 11: 3, 12: 9, 13: 3, 14: 9, 15: 3.\nSo what changed: column 5 input=3 changed to 0, column6 input=9 changed to 0, column7 input=3 changed to 0, column8 input=0 remains 0, column9 input=0 remains 0, column10 input=0 remains 0, but then column14: input=3 changed to 9 possibly? Wait, let's recalc column by column:\n- col0: input 9 -> output 9 (unchanged)\n- col1: input 3 -> output 3\n- col2: input 3 -> output 3\n- col3: input 0 -> output 0\n- col4: input 0 -> output 0\n- col5: input 3 -> output 0 (changed)\n- col6: input 9 -> output 0 (changed)\n- col7: input 3 -> output 0 (changed)\n- col8: input 0 -> output 0\n- col9: input 0 -> output 0\n- col10: input 0 -> output 0\n- col11: input 3 -> output 3\n- col12: input 9 -> output 9\n- col13: input 3 -> output 3\n- col14: input 3 -> output 9 (changed)\n- col15: input 3 -> output 3, but then wait, output row7 should have 16 digits. Actually, check row7 output: \"933000000003393\" count digits: 9,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,9,3,9,3. Yes, that fits.\nSo differences: in row7, some digits in the middle became zero, and one digit at col14 became 9. Let's check row8:\nRow8: input: \"393003390009333\", output: \"393000000009333\". Similarly, differences: from col? Let's index row8:\nInput: \"393003390009333\"\nIndices: 0: 3,1: 9,2: 3,3: 0,4: 0,5: 3,6: 3,7: 9,8: 0,9: 0,10: 0,11: 9,12: 3,13: 3,14: 3,15: 3.\nOutput: \"393000000009333\" \nIndices: 0:3,1:9,2:3,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:9,12:3,13:3,14:3,15:3.\nSo differences row7 and row8: column5,6,7 changed to 0 in both rows, but row8 col? Actually, check row8: col5 input=3-> becomes 0, col6 input=3-> becomes 0, col7 input=9-> becomes 0. And no change at col14.\nRow9: input: \"333000000003393\", output: \"333000000003393\" (unchanged)\nRow10: input: \"933000000003933\", output: \"933000000003933\" (unchanged)\nRow11: input: \"339033393003393\", output: \"339033393003393\" (unchanged)\nRow12: input: \"000093933003339\", output: \"000093933003339\"\nRow13: input: \"000033333009333\", output: \"000033333009333\"\nRows 14,15 unchanged.\n\nSo in E.g. 1, only rows 7,8 changed. And the transformation seems to zero out a middle block? Not sure.\n\nLet's check E.g. 2 differences: \nE.g. 2 Input:\nRow1: \"033300000000000\" -> Output: \"033300000000000\" unchanged.\nRow2: Input: \"093900333330000\" -> Output: \"093900000000000\".

So difference is that digit '0' at col3 becomes '2'? But let's check pattern:\nRow4: \"0000200000\"\nRow5: \"0000020000\"\nRow6: \"0000002300\"\nRow7: \"0000003330\"\nRow8: \"0000002300\"\nRow9: \"0000020000\"\nRow10:\"0003200000\"\nRow11:\"0033300000\"\nRow12:\"0003000000\"\nRow13:\"0000000000\"\n\nLet's check differences:\n- Row3: input \"0030000000\" -> output \"0032000000\": So the digit at index 3 is changed from '0' to '2'. Possibly it's the \"center\" digit of a pattern?\n- Row4: input \"0000000000\" -> output \"0000200000\": digit at index 4 becomes '2'? Actually check: row4: \"0000200000\". The digit at index 4? Wait, it's \"0000200000\" means: indices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:2, then zeros. \n- Row5: input \"0000000000\" -> output \"0000020000\": so digit at index 5 becomes '2'? Wait, row5: \"0000020000\": The digit '2' at index? Actually, let's index: row5: \"0000020000\", the '2' is at index 5? Actually, check: \"0000020000\": digits: 0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0. So yes, index 5 becomes '2'? But earlier row3 had index 3 changed to 2. So pattern: row3 changed digit at col3 becomes 2; row4 changed digit at col4 becomes 2; row5 changed digit at col5 becomes 2. Row6: input \"0000000300\" -> output \"0000002300\": changed digit at index? \"0000000300\" vs \"0000002300\": difference: at index 6? Let's check: \"0000000300\": digits: index0-0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=0, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0, index7=3, index8=0, index9=0; but output \"0000002300\": digits: index0-0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=0, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0, index7=2, index8=3, index9=0. Wait check: \"0000002300\" actually has digits: positions: 0,0,0,0,0,0,2,3,0,0. So the difference is that the '3' is shifted one to the right? Let's re-read: Actually, row6 input \"0000000300\" vs output \"0000002300\": the digit '3' originally at col? Wait, I'll re-check the digits:\nRow6 input: \"0000000300\". Counting: indices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:3,8:0,9:0. \nRow6 output: \"0000002300\". Counting: indices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:2,7:3,8:0,9:0.\nSo the difference: the '3' stays at index 7, but there's an extra '2' inserted at index 6. So maybe rule: Insert a digit to the left of a digit 3? Let's check row7: input \"0000003330\" -> output \"0000003330\": unchanged. Row8: input \"0000000300\" -> output \"0000002300\": same as row6? Actually row8 input \"0000000300\" becomes \"0000002300\": same pattern as row6.\nRow9: input \"0000000000\" -> output \"0000020000\": digit at index 5 becomes 2. Row10: input \"0003000000\" -> output \"0003200000\": changed from \"0003000000\" to \"0003200000\": difference: the \"0\" at index? \"0003000000\": digits: index0:0,1:0,2:0,3:3,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0; output \"0003200000\": digits: index0:0,1:0,2:0,3:3,4:2,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0; so the difference: the digit 0 at index 4 becomes 2? But wait, pattern: row3 had change at col3. Row4: change at col4, row5: change at col5, row9: change at col5. But row10: change at col4 becomes 2. Let's check row11: input \"0033300000\" -> output \"0033300000\": unchanged. Row12: input \"0003000000\" -> output \"0003000000\": unchanged. Row13: input \"0000000000\" -> output \"0000000000\": unchanged.\n\nLet's check also row7: \"0000003330\" remains same. So pattern: In some rows, a \"0\" is replaced by \"2\" at a certain column, and sometimes an extra \"2\" is inserted before a \"3\"? Let's re-read: In row3, originally \"0030000000\", becomes \"0032000000\". So pattern: If row index is 3, maybe the third element? Let's check row4: \"0000000000\" becomes \"0000200000\": digit at index 4 changed to 2. row5: \"0000000000\" becomes \"0000020000\": digit at index 5 changed to 2. row9: \"0000000000\" becomes \"0000020000\": digit at index 5 changed to 2.\nAlso row10: \"0003000000\" becomes \"0003200000\": digit at index 4 changed to 2. So pattern might be: In rows that have a \"3\" in them, sometimes the digit immediately to the left of that \"3\" becomes 2. Let's check row2: \"0333000000\" remains \"0333000000\", no change. Row3: \"0030000000\" has a \"3\" at col2? Actually, row3: \"0030000000\": digits: index0:0, index1:0, index2:3, index3:0, etc. And output becomes \"003200", "prompt_tokens": 1003, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Apply this rule to the test input grid.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1],\n  [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n  [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n  [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n  [0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n  [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n  [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],\n  [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],\n  [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0],\n  [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 3557, "completion_tokens": 1233}

The input is a pair of examples (E.g.1, E.g.2) and then a test input grid which we need to transform. The description says: \"provided input and output examples, deduce transformation rule.\" The examples show transformation from a grid of 0's and 1's to one with 0's, 1's, 8's and sometimes 1 replaced with 8. Wait, let's re-read the examples carefully.\n\nWe have two examples provided.\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput E.g.1 is a grid of size maybe 24x30? Actually count columns and rows: The first example lines: they are given as lines. Let's count rows: Let me count them:\n\nE.g.1 Input grid lines:\n\nLine 1: \"0000000000000000000000000000\" length = 30? Actually count digits: \"0000000000000000000000000000\" count: maybe 30 digits? Let me count properly: The first line \"0000000000000000000000000000\". Count groups: \"000000\" (6) + \"000000\" (6) = 12, then \"000000\" (6) = 18, so maybe it's 24? Let's count manually: Actually I'll count manually: \"0000000000000000000000000000\" is 30 zeros? Wait, note: \"0000000000000000000000000000\" I'll count: It might be 30 digits if no spaces. The second line \"0011111110000000000111111110\" count: that's 30 digits as well maybe. Actually number digits: \"0000\" (4), \"11111\" (5) but this is ambiguous. Let's count carefully: The first line: \"0000000000000000000000000000\". I'll count: positions: maybe it's 30 digits. But anyway not crucial.\n\nE.g. 1 output grid: It has many occurrences of \"8\". There's also \"1\", \"0\", and \"8\" which is new. And some numbers, like \"800\", \"888\" etc. In the transformation, the original grid had ones in some shape. Let's inspect E.g.1 Input and Output.\n\nI'll try to deduce pattern. Let me list coordinates for E.g.1 input grid visually, but it's large. Possibly the transformation is: \"draw a filled rectangle around the border of the figure\" or \"spread out the original 1's and fill the interior with 8's\" or something.\n\nCheck E.g.1: Input grid (E.g.1):\n\nLine numbers (I'll number them row0 to row23 maybe):\n\nRow0: \"0000000000000000000000000000\" (all zeros)\nRow1: \"0011111110000000000111111110\"\nRow2: \"0010000010000000000100000010\"\nRow3: \"0000000010000000000100000000\"\nRow4: \"0010000010000000000100000010\"\nRow5: \"0011111110000000000111111110\"\nRow6: \"0000000000000000000000000000\"\n\nSo the top part seems to be 7 rows (0 to 6) and then a gap of some rows. Then row7: \"0000000000001110111110000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000001000000010000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000001000000010000000\"\nRow10: \"0000000000001000000010000000\"\nRow11: \"0000000000001000000010000000\"\nRow12: \"0000000000001000000010000000\"\nRow13: \"0000000000001111111110000000\"\nRow14: \"0000011111100000000000000000\"\nRow15: \"0000010000100000000000000000\"\nRow16: \"0000010000100000000000000000\"\nRow17: \"0000010000100000000000000000\"\nRow18: \"0000010000100000000111111000\"\nRow19: \"0000010000100000000100001000\"\nRow20: \"0000011111100000000100001000\"\nRow21: \"0000000000000000000100001000\"\nRow22: \"0000000000000000000111111000\"\nRow23: \"0000000000000000000000000000\"\n\nNow compare E.g.1 Output grid:\n\nRow0: \"0000000000000008000000000000\". Compare row0 input: \"0000000000000000000000000000\". Only difference: the substring \"000\" becomes \"800\"? Let's check: row0 output is \"0000000000000008000000000000\". Look at position: maybe 16th column (0-indexed) is 8? Because there's \"800\" inserted in the middle maybe.\nRow1: \"0011111110000008000111111110\" vs input row1 \"0011111110000000000111111110\". So substitution: in the middle, originally \"000000\" becomes \"000000800\" maybe.\nRow2: \"0018888810000008000188888810\" vs input row2 \"0010000010000000000100000010\". So pattern: The ones become 8's? Let's compare:\n\nInput row2: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 ... Actually let's align: \nRow2 input: \"0010000010000000000100000010\"\nRow2 output: \"0018888810000008000188888810\"\nSo mapping: The digit \"1\" in input becomes \"8\" in output, sometimes with additional digit \"8\" appended? And also some \"0\" become \"8\"? Compare column by column.\n\nRow2 input: digits: \nindex:0:0,1:0,2:1,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:1,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:0,17:0,18:0,19:0,20:1,21:0,22:0,23:0,24:0,25:0,26:0,27:0,28:1,29:0 maybe.\n\nRow2 output: \"0018888810000008000188888810\". Let's check segments: \"00188888\" then \"1\" then \"00000080\" then \"0188888810\". It appears that there is a \"1\" in the input that becomes \"8\" in output sometimes replaced by 8's in a block. Also note row2 output has a block \"888\" in the middle. \n\nRow3: \"8888888810000008000188888888\" vs input row3 \"0000000010000000000100000000\". So row3: input had a single '1' at column 6 maybe, and now becomes \"88888888\" at left block.\n\nLet's check row3 input further:\n\"0000000010000000000100000000\"\nMaybe there's a \"1\" at position 7? Wait, let's count positions: if row length is 30 maybe:\nRow3: \"0000000010000000000100000000\"\nBreak into segments: \"00000000\" (8 zeros) then \"1\" then \"00000000\" (8 zeros) then \"0\" then \"100000000\"? No, let me recalc: It might be 30 columns. Actually, count digits: The string \"0000000010000000000100000000\" count: 8 zeros + 1 = 9, then \"00000000\" = 8, then \"0\" = 1, then \"100000000\" = ? I need to count carefully. Let me count: \"0000000010000000000100000000\"\nI can count manually: digits: \n0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nSo positions: index0-7: 0, index8: 1, index9-16: 0, index17: 1, index18-? Actually wait, check: after index8: \"1\", then what remains? \"00000000\" is 8 zeros, then \"0\" then \"100000000\" but that doesn't match.\nLet's try to segment row3 output: \"8888888810000008000188888888\". It has left block \"88888888\" (8 digits) then \"1\" then \"00000080\" then \"0188888888\" (10 digits maybe). So likely transformation is not simply 1->8 everywhere. It appears that some positions become 8, some remain 0 or 1, and sometimes extra 8's are inserted.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: \"Fill in the interior of the shape with 8's, while preserving the boundary with 1's\" But then row2 input: \"0010000010000000000100000010\" becomes \"0018888810000008000188888810\". Notice that in the output, some ones become 8's", "prompt_tokens": 1675, "completion_tokens": 2048}

It's 9x9 grid. Looking at transformation:\n- In input, there are some 4's and some 4's and one 1? Wait: There is one 414 row third row: \"414444444\". In output, row 3 becomes \"414444444\" same but then row 4 becomes \"441444444\" instead of \"444444444\". So what changed? Let's check differences row by row:\nRow 1: Input: \"444444444\", Output: \"444444444\" (no change).\nRow 2: Input: \"444444444\", Output: \"444444444\" (no change).\nRow 3: Input: \"414444444\", Output: \"414444444\" (no change).\nRow 4: Input: \"444444444\", Output: \"441444444\" changed: The fourth row: originally \"444444444\", changed to \"441444444\", that means one of the digits changed: the 4 at column 4 becomes 1, because \"441444444\" is: index positions: first three characters: \"444\", then \"1\", then \"44444\". So transformation: the digit was 4 replaced by 1.\nRow 5: Input: \"444444444\", Output: \"444144444\": That is similar: in row 5, column 4 becomes 1, because there's \"444144444\": columns: 1:4,2:4,3:4,4:1, 5:4,6:4,7:4,8:4,9:4. So row5's digit at column4 changed from 4 to 1.\nRow 6: Input: \"444444444\", Output: \"444414444\": That means column 5 becomes 1: Actually \"444414444\": positions: 1:4,2:4,3:4,4:4,5:1,6:4,7:4,8:4,9:4. So row6: at column5 changed from 4 to 1.\nRow 7: Input: \"444444444\", Output: \"444441444\": That means column 6 becomes 1: \"444441444\": digits: positions: 1:4,2:4,3:4,4:4,5:4,6:1,7:4,8:4,9:4.\nRow 8: Input: \"444444144\", Output: \"444444144\": no change. Row 9: Input: \"444444444\", Output: \"444444444\": no change.\n\nSo pattern: The transformation is that certain cells with '4' are replaced by '1' in output. The positions of transformation: row4 col4, row5 col4, row6 col5, row7 col6. But wait, check row3: originally \"414444444\" remains unchanged. But row3 already had a 1. So maybe rule is: In each row, if there is a 4 that is adjacent to a 1? Or maybe rule is: choose a diagonal pattern of ones. Let's check the pattern coordinates:\n\nFor row4, the changed cell is at column4 (0-indexed: row3, col3) but there is a 1 in row3 col1? Actually, let's write indexes with 0-indexing. Let's denote rows index from 0 to 8, columns index from 0 to 8.\n\nRow3: originally \"414444444\", so cell (3,0)=4, (3,1)=1, (3,2)=4, so the 1 in row3 is at column1. But row3 did not change. But row4 changed cell (4,? Actually careful: row numbering: row0=1st row, row1=2nd, row2=3rd, row3=4th, row4=5th, row5=6th, row6=7th, row7=8th, row8=9th). Let me re-index:\nGiven grid rows: I'll index them as row0 to row8.\nRow0: input: \"444444444\", output same.\nRow1: same.\nRow2: input: \"414444444\", output same.\nRow3: input: \"444444444\", output: \"441444444\". So in row3, column? In \"441444444\", the changed digit is at index 3? Let's check: \"441444444\", characters: index0: '4', index1: '4', index2: '1', index3: '4'? Wait, let's re-read exactly: \"441444444\". How many characters? 9 characters.\nIndices: 0:4, 1:4, 2:1, 3:4, 4:4, 5:4, 6:4, 7:4, 8:4.\nSo changed digit is at col2 changed from 4 to 1. But wait, but the example said \"441444444\" but then earlier I assumed col3 changed to 1? Let's re-read the example carefully. The given example 1:\nInput:\nRow1: \"444444444\"\nRow2: \"444444444\"\nRow3: \"414444444\"\nRow4: \"444444444\"\nRow5: \"444444444\"\nRow6: \"444444444\"\nRow7: \"444444444\"\nRow8: \"444444144\"\nRow9: \"444444444\"\n\nOutput:\nRow1: \"444444444\"\nRow2: \"444444444\"\nRow3: \"414444444\"\nRow4: \"441444444\"\nRow5: \"444144444\"\nRow6: \"444414444\"\nRow7: \"444441444\"\nRow8: \"444444144\"\nRow9: \"444444444\"\n\nSo row numbering: line count. Let me index lines:\nLine1: \"444444444\" (unchanged)\nLine2: \"444444444\" (unchanged)\nLine3: \"414444444\" (unchanged)\nLine4: \"444444444\" becomes \"441444444\"\nLine5: \"444444444\" becomes \"444144444\"\nLine6: \"444444444\" becomes \"444414444\"\nLine7: \"444444444\" becomes \"444441444\"\nLine8: \"444444144\" remains same.\nLine9: \"444444444\" remains same.\n\nSo if I consider row indices starting 0:\nRow0: unchanged.\nRow1: unchanged.\nRow2: unchanged.\nRow3: changed: \"444444444\" becomes \"441444444\". Which digit changed? Compare positions: In row3, the difference between input and output: \"444444444\" vs \"441444444\". The difference is at the third digit? Let's compare character by character:\nRow3 input: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4. \nRow3 output: 4 4 1 4 4 4 4 4 4.\nSo changed cell is column index 2 (0-indexed).\nRow4: input row4: \"444444444\" becomes \"444144444\". Compare: digits: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 vs 4 4 4 1 4 4 4 4 4, so changed cell is column index 3.\nRow5: input row5: \"444444444\" becomes \"444414444\". Compare: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 vs 4 4 4 4 1 4 4 4 4, so changed cell is column index 4.\nRow6: input row6: \"444444444\" becomes \"444441444\". Compare: digits: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 vs 4 4 4 4 4 1 4 4 4, so changed cell is column index 5.\nRow7: \"444444144\" unchanged.\nRow8: unchanged.\n\nSo pattern: On rows 3,4,5,6 (0-indexed) the transformation happens. The changed column in each row is: row3: col2, row4: col3, row5: col4, row6: col5. So pattern: The changed cell is moving along a diagonal: row3 col2, row4 col3, row5 col4, row6 col5. And note that row2 had a 1 at col1, row8 has a 1 at col7? Row8 input is \"444444144\" actually row8: \"444444144\" characters: positions:\nRow8: \"444444144\": digits: 4,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4. So row8 already had a 1 at col6. And row3 output: \"414444444\"", "prompt_tokens": 1184, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We need to deduce rule from examples and then apply to test input.\n\nLet's analyze given examples.\n\nExample 1:\nInput 1 is 10 rows, each 10 characters digits? Actually, they are strings of digits \"5\" and \"0\" apparently. Let's look at sample:\n\nE.g. 1 Input (10 rows, each row is 10 characters, digits \"5\" and \"0\"). \n\nRow input 1:\n1. \"5555505555\"\n2. \"5555555555\"\n3. \"5555555555\"\n4. \"5055505555\"\n5. \"5555005555\"\n6. \"5055055555\"\n7. \"5055055555\"\n8. \"5555555505\"\n9. \"5055005505\"\n10. \"5555555505\"\n\nCorresponding output:\n1. \"5555535555\"\n2. \"5555555555\"\n3. \"5555555555\"\n4. \"5155535555\"\n5. \"5555235555\"\n6. \"5155255555\"\n7. \"5155255555\"\n8. \"5555555545\"\n9. \"5155235545\"\n10. \"5555555545\"\n\nWe need to find a mapping rule. Let's denote cells as 5's and 0's, but output digits are 5,1,3,4, etc. They are not binary. They are digits in string. The transformation is not plain binary inversion, but some arithmetic transformation. Could it be some counting or pattern fill?\n\nLet's analyze row by row differences.\n\nObserving Example 1:\n\nRow 1: \"5555505555\" -> \"5555535555\"\nComparing row 1: The input is \"5555505555\", output is \"5555535555\". So what changed? The difference is at index 5? Let's check positions indexing from left 0 to 9:\nRow1 input: 5,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5.\nRow1 output: 5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5. So the 6th character changed from 0 to 3. Possibly rule: if a zero is adjacent to some other zeros? Possibly rule: count number of zeros in a row? Let's check row 1: count zeros: there is exactly one zero at index 5. Then output digit is maybe \"3\"? But then row 2? Row2: \"5555555555\" -> \"5555555555\", no zeros, so no change. Row3: same.\n\nRow4: Input: \"5055505555\" -> Output: \"5155535555\". Let's check row4: Input: digits: 5,0,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5? Wait recalc row4: input row4 is \"5055505555\". Actually, let me recount row4: It is \"5 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 5 5\"? Let's check string: \"5055505555\": digits: index0=5, index1=0, index2=5, index3=5, index4=5, index5=0, index6=5, index7=5, index8=5, index9=5.\nOutput row4: \"5155535555\": digits: index0=5, index1=1, index2=5, index3=5, index4=5, index5=3, index6=5, index7=5, index8=3, index9=5.\nSo differences: index1 changed from 0 to 1, index5 changed from 0 to 3, index8 changed from 5 to 3? Wait, we see: row4 input: \npositions: \n0:5, \n1:0, \n2:5, \n3:5, \n4:5, \n5:0, \n6:5, \n7:5, \n8:5, \n9:5.\nOutput row4: \n0:5, \n1:1, \n2:5, \n3:5, \n4:5, \n5:3, \n6:5, \n7:5, \n8:3, \n9:5.\nSo differences: at index1: 0 -> 1, at index5: 0 -> 3, at index8: 5 -> 3. So not all zeros change; index8 was originally 5 but changed to 3. Why? Let's check row5:\nRow5: Input \"5555005555\" -> output \"5555235555\". Let's check row5: input: digits: 5,5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5. Output: \"5555235555\": digits: 5,5,5,5,5,2,3,5,5,5,5. Differences: index5: 0 -> 2, index6: 0 -> 3. So pattern: maybe conversion of zeros to some digits based on counting zeros or possibly based on positions relative to adjacent zeros.\n\nLet's check row6: Input \"5055055555\" -> output \"5155255555\". Row6: input digits: \"5,0,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,5,5\"? Wait, let's count: \"5055055555\": indices: 0:5, 1:0, 2:5, 3:5, 4:0, 5:5, 6:5, 7:5, 8:5, 9:5, 10? Actually, 10 characters only. Let me recalc: \"5055055555\" is 10 characters: positions: \n0:5, 1:0, 2:5, 3:5, 4:0, 5:5, 6:5, 7:5, 8:5, 9:5.\nOutput row6: \"5155255555\": digits: \n0:5, 1:1, 2:5, 3:5, 4:2, 5:5, 6:5, 7:5, 8:5, 9:5.\nSo differences: index1: 0 -> 1, index4: 0 -> 2.\nRow7: Input \"5055055555\" (again) -> output \"5155255555\" (again). So same as row6.\nRow8: Input \"5555555505\" -> output \"5555555545\". Let's check row8: input: \"5555555505\": digits: positions: \n0:5, 1:5, 2:5, 3:5, 4:5, 5:5, 6:5, 7:5, 8:0, 9:5. \nOutput: \"5555555545\": digits: \n0:5, 1:5, 2:5, 3:5, 4:5, 5:5, 6:5, 7:5, 8:4, 9:5.\nSo difference: index8: 0 -> 4.\nRow9: Input \"5055005505\" -> output \"5155235545\". Let's check row9: input: \"5055005505\": digits: \n0:5, 1:0, 2:5, 3:5, 4:0, 5:0, 6:5, 7:5, 8:0, 9:5.\nOutput: \"5155235545\": digits: \n0:5, 1:1, 2:5, 3:5, 4:2, 5:3, 6:5, 7:5, 8:4, 9:5.\nDifferences: index1: 0 -> 1, index4: 0 -> 2, index5: 0 -> 3, index8: 0 -> 4.\nRow10: Input \"5555555505\" -> output \"5555555545\". Compare row10: input \"5555555505\": digits: \n0:5, 1:5, 2:5, 3:5, 4:5, 5:5, 6:5, 7:5, 8:0, 9:5.\nOutput: \"5555555545\": digits:\n0:5, 1:5, 2:5, 3:5, 4:5, 5:5, 6:5, 7:5, 8:4, 9:5.\nDifference: index8: 0 -> 4.\n\nObserving differences: The outputs sometimes have digits other than 0 and 5. They are 1,2,3,4, etc. They seem to be increments maybe relative to the count of consecutive zeros? Let me check row1: There's one zero at position 5, and it becomes 3. Row2: no zeros, no changes. Row3: same.\nRow4: there are two zeros: positions 1 and 5. They become 1 and 3 respectively. Row5: two zeros: positions", "prompt_tokens": 771, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The transformation rule is unknown. I need to analyze examples and deduce transformation rule. I'll re-read description: \"The user will provide several pairs of example input grids and their corresponding output grids. They represent a hidden transformation rule.\" There are 3 example pairs provided and then a test input. Let me re-read the examples:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n060007\n000400\n200090\n003000\n000500\n100080\nOutput:\n647\n239\n158\n\nE.g. 2:\nInput:\n000700800\n040000000\n000000000\n000002000\n000000001\n500000000\n003000600\n000090000\n000000000\nOutput:\n478\n521\n396\n\nE.g. 3:\nInput:\n200100\n000007\n030090\n005000\n000600\n400080\nOutput:\n217\n359\n468\n\nTest Input:\n000000900\n500006000\n000000000\n000000080\n000001000\n004000000\n000000000\n030200000\n000000007\n\nWe need to deduce transformation rule from examples. Let's re-read more carefully.\n\nThe provided examples are grids, possibly with numbers? They are strings like \"060007\", \"000400\", etc. They look like they have no spaces maybe? Let me check structure:\nFor E.g. 1: There are 6 rows. The rows have length 6? Actually E.g. 1 input lines:\n1st line: \"060007\" (6 characters) but it appears they are not uniform? Actually count: \"060007\" is 6 digits, \"000400\" is 6 digits, \"200090\" is 6 digits, \"003000\" is 6 digits, \"000500\" is 6 digits, \"100080\" is 6 digits. So input grid is 6x6.\nOutput for E.g. 1 is 3 rows and each row is 3 digits: \"647\", \"239\", \"158\". So transformation from 6x6 to 3x3.\n\nE.g. 2: Input has 9 rows, each row is 9 digits? Let's check: \"000700800\" is 9 digits, \"040000000\" is 9 digits, etc. So transformation from 9x9 grid to 3 rows of 3 digits? Actually output E.g. 2 is \"478\" then \"521\", then \"396\". So transformation from 9x9 to 3x3.\nE.g. 3: Input has 6 rows, each row is 6 digits? Actually check: \"200100\" (6 digits), \"000007\" (6 digits), \"030090\" (6 digits), \"005000\" (6 digits), \"000600\" (6 digits), \"400080\" (6 digits). So transformation from 6x6 to 3x3.\n\nSo pattern: all examples have square grids of even size? Actually 6 and 9? Wait, but 6 and 9 are not even, they are even numbers? 6 is even, 9 is odd. But maybe rule: The output grid is half the dimension? In E.g. 1, input 6 rows become output 3 rows, each row length 6 becomes 3 columns. Similarly E.g. 2: input 9 rows become output 3 rows, with 9 columns become 3 columns maybe? And E.g. 3: input 6 rows become output 3 rows. That is a consistent pattern: output grid is exactly one third of the input grid in both dimensions? Wait check: 6 rows input -> 3 rows output, 6 columns input -> 3 columns output. Similarly for 9x9 input -> 3x3 output. So it seems the transformation rule is: reduce the grid by summing sub-squares? Possibly take each 2x2 block? No: 6/2 = 3, 9/3 = 3, so rule: maybe divide grid into 3x3 blocks of equal size. But 6/3=2, so each block is 2 rows by 2 columns. Wait, check: For e.g. 1: input 6x6, if we divide into 3 blocks in vertical and 3 blocks in horizontal, each block is 2x2. But then output grid is 3x3, and each cell in output grid is computed from a corresponding 2x2 block? But then what's the transformation? Possibly sum of the digits in a 2x2 block? Let's check E.g. 1: we have 6 rows and 6 columns, divided into 3 blocks of 2 rows each and 3 blocks of 2 columns each. So each block is 2x2. Now which 2x2 block corresponds to output cell? Let me denote input grid as grid with indices row, column. Then output cell (i, j) corresponds to block starting at row 2*i, col 2*j in base indexing from 0? But let's test: For E.g. 1, output cell top-left is \"6\". That should come from block (0,0): rows0-1, columns0-1. Input block (0,0): row0: \"0 0 0 0 0 7\"? Wait, careful: The grid is 6 columns wide, so columns 0 and 1 of row0 \"0\" and \"0\"? Let's denote rows as string indexes:\nRow0: \"060007\" => digits: col0=0, col1=6, col2=0, col3=0, col4=0, col5=7.\nRow1: \"000400\" => digits: col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=4, col4=0, col5=0.\nRow2: \"200090\" => digits: 2,0,0,0,9,0.\nRow3: \"003000\" => digits: 0,0,3,0,0,0.\nRow4: \"000500\" => digits: 0,0,0,5,0,0.\nRow5: \"100080\" => digits: 1,0,0,0,8,0.\n\nNow, if we divide into blocks of 2 rows and 2 columns, then block positions:\nBlock (0,0): rows0-1, cols0-1 = \nRow0: [0,6]\nRow1: [0,0]\nSum = 0+6+0+0 = 6, matches output top-left cell \"6\". Next, block (0,1): rows0-1, cols2-3 = \nRow0: [0,0]\nRow1: [0,4]\nSum = 0+0+0+4 = 4, but output top-middle is \"4\"? Actually output top row is \"647\". Wait \"647\": first row digits: first cell =6, second =4, third =7. So yes block (0,1) gives 4.\nBlock (0,2): rows0-1, cols4-5 = \nRow0: [0,7]\nRow1: [0,0]\nSum = 0+7+0+0 =7. So top row blocks sums: 6, 4, 7 -> corresponds to output \"647\". Now check second output row \"239\". That is output row1. It should come from blocks in rows 2-3.\nBlock (1,0): rows2-3, cols0-1:\nRow2: [2,0]\nRow3: [0,0]\nSum = 2+0+0+0 = 2, but output digit is \"2\" in second row first column.\nBlock (1,1): rows2-3, cols2-3:\nRow2: [0,0]\nRow3: [3,0]\nSum = 0+0+3+0 = 3, matches output second row second digit \"3\".\nBlock (1,2): rows2-3, cols4-5:\nRow2: [9,0]\nRow3: [0,0]\nSum = 9+0+0+0 = 9, but output digit is \"9\"? But expected second row third digit is \"9\"? Actually output row2 is \"239\", so second row second digit is \"3\"? Let me re-read output row2: It's \"239\", so second row digits: first digit is 2, second is 3, third is 9. So block (1,2) computed sum=9, matches.\nThird output row \"158\" from block rows 4-5.\nBlock (2,0): rows4-5, cols0-1:\nRow4: [0,0]\nRow5: [1,0]\nSum = 0+0+1+0 = 1, matches.\nBlock (2,1): rows4-5, cols2-3:\nRow4: [0,5]\nRow5: [0,0]\nSum = 0+5+0+0 = 5, matches.\nBlock (2,2): rows4-5, cols4-5:\nRow4: [0,0]\nRow5: [8,0]\nSum = 0+0+8+0 = 8, but expected third row third digit is \"8\"? But output row3 is \"158\" so third digit is 8, correct.\n\nSo E.g. 1", "prompt_tokens": 547, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The test input grid follows the same pattern, so apply the same transformation rule.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[\n    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,", "prompt_tokens": 1968, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The transformation rule is hidden. We are given multiple examples. Our job is to analyze the provided examples and deduce the transformation rule, then apply it to a final test input grid.\n\nWe are provided with example grids with apparently same dimensions? Let's re-read the examples:\n\nFirstly, the problem statement says: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" We are provided with examples with provided input and output. The examples are numbered E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3. They are grids represented as text with lines. They have rows separated by newline. They are not necessarily same dimensions. We must deduce transformation rule from the examples.\n\nLet's re-read examples in detail:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nLine 1: \"000000000000000000\"\nLine 2: \"028220118811110000\"\nLine 3: \"088220118811110000\"\nLine 4: \"028880881111880000\"\nLine 5: \"028220881111880000\"\nLine 6: \"000000000000000000\"\nLine 7: \"011111111111111110\"\nLine 8: \"011111111111111110\"\nLine 9: \"011111111111111110\"\nLine 10: \"011111111111111110\"\nLine 11: \"011111111111111110\"\nLine 12: \"011111111111111110\"\nLine 13: \"011111111111111110\"\nLine 14: \"011111111111111110\"\nLine 15: \"000000000000000000\"\nLine 16: \"000000000000000000\"\nLine 17: \"000000000000000000\"\n\nSo the input grid is 17 rows by 20 columns? Let's count columns: each line has 20 characters? Actually, let's count first line: \"000000000000000000\" -> 20 digits? Wait, count: \"0\" repeated 20 times? Let's check: \"000000000000000000\" has 20 digits because the problem statement \"000000000000000000\" appears in many examples. But then \"028220118811110000\" is 20 characters as well. So input grid is 17 rows x 20 columns? Let's check number of rows: There are 17 lines, so grid is 17 x 20. But then E.g. 1 output has:\n\"1111181111111111\"\n\"1111881111111111\"\n\"1111188811111111\"\n\"1111181111111111\"\n\"1811111111111811\"\n\"8811111111118811\"\n\"1888111111111888\"\n\"1811111111111811\"\n\nSo output grid is 8 rows by 16 columns? Wait check: first output line \"1111181111111111\" has 16 digits? Actually count: \"1111181111111111\" has length: there are 16 digits. Because \"11111\" then \"8\" then \"1111111111\"? Let's count: \"1111181111111111\": count digits: maybe it's 16 digits.\n\nLet's count: \"11111\" is 5, then \"8\" is 1, then \"1111111111\" is 10, total 5+1+10=16. So output for E.g. 1 is 8 rows x 16 columns. So rule seems to be: given a grid, the output grid has dimensions that are roughly half the input grid sizes? Let's check E.g. 2 Input:\n\"000000000000000000\"\n\"028203383300000000\"\n\"088808333800000000\"\n\"028203383300000000\"\n\"000000000000000000\"\n\"033333333333333300\"\n\"033333333333333300\"\n\"033333333333333300\"\n\"033333333333333300\"\n\"033333333333333300\"\n\"033333333333333300\"\n\"033333333333333300\"\n\"033333333333333300\"\n\"033333333333333300\"\n\"000000000000000000\"\n\"000000000000000000\"\n\nThat is 18 rows x 20 columns? Let's count: first line 20 digits, second line is 20 digits. The number of rows: count lines: They are 18 rows. Output for E.g. 2:\n\"333333383333333\"\n\"333333888333333\"\n\"333333383333333\"\n\"383333333333383\"\n\"888333333333888\"\n\"383333333333383\"\n\"333333383333333\"\n\"333333888333333\"\n\"333333383333333\"\n\nThat is 9 rows output, each line 15 digits? Let's check: \"333333383333333\" count digits: count: \"333333\" is 6, then \"8\" then \"333333\" is 6, then \"3\"? Actually, let's count properly:\n\"333333383333333\" -> Count digits: there are 15 digits. So output grid is 9 rows x 15 columns. E.g. 3 Input:\n\"000000000000000\"\n\"282044884400000\"\n\"822044884400000\"\n\"888088448800000\"\n\"000088448800000\"\n\"000000000000000\"\n\"000444444444000\"\n\"000444444444000\"\n\"000444444444000\"\n\"000444444444000\"\n\"000444444444000\"\n\"000444444444000\"\n\"000000000000000\"\n\"000000000000000\"\n\"000000000000000\"\n\nCount rows: how many lines? Let's count: lines: first row: \"000000000000000\" is 15 digits? Actually, count: \"000000000000000\" length: 15? Actually, check: \"000000000000000\" -> 15 digits? Let's see: \"000000000000000\" should be 15 if there are 15 zeros. Let's count manually: \"000000000000000\" -> that is 15 zeros. But then second line \"282044884400000\" is 15 digits? Count: \"282044884400000\" -> maybe 15 digits. Actually, let's check: \"282044884400000\" count digits: 15 digits? Let's count: 2,8,2,0,4,4,8,8,4,4,0,0,0,0,0 = 15 digits. So input grid for E.g. 3 is 15 rows x 15 columns. And output for E.g. 3:\n\"444484444\"\n\"444844444\"\n\"444888444\"\n\"484444484\"\n\"844444844\"\n\"888444888\"\n\nSo output grid for E.g. 3 is 6 rows x 9 columns? Let's check: \"444484444\" count: 9 digits. So pattern: Input grid size is reduced by half or something? Let's check dimensions: E.g. 1 input: 17 rows x 20 columns, output: 8 rows x 16 columns. E.g. 2 input: 18 rows x 20 columns, output: 9 rows x 15 columns. E.g. 3 input: 15 rows x 15 columns, output: 6 rows x 9 columns.\n\nMaybe the rule is: take the middle part of the grid, and remove the outer border rows and columns. Maybe not exactly: In E.g. 1, if we remove outer border rows, maybe we take rows 2 to 15? That would be 14 rows, but output is 8 rows. Alternatively: maybe the transformation is \"compress\" the input grid into a smaller grid. Let's check specific patterns.\n\nObserving E.g. 1: Look at the input grid structure. There are two regions: one region at the top part (rows 1-6) and one region at the bottom part (rows 7-14) separated by blank rows? There is a blank row at row 16 and row 17? Actually, input E.g. 1 has rows:\nRows 1-6: top part is mostly zeros, but rows 2-5 have some pattern digits like 2 and 8 and 1 and 1 and 0? Let's re-read input E.g. 1:\nRow1: zeros.\nRow2: \"028220118811110000\"\nRow3: \"088220118811110000\"\nRow4: \"028880881111880000\"\nRow5: \"028220881111880000\"\nRow6: zeros.\nRow7: \"011111111111111110\"\nRow8: same\nRow9: same\nRow10: same\nRow11: same\nRow12: same\nRow13: same\nRow14: same\nRow15: zeros.\nRow16: zeros.\nRow17: zeros.\n\nOutput E.g. 1:\nRow1: \"1111181111111111\"\nRow2: \"1111881111111111\"\nRow3: \"1111188811111111\"\nRow4: \"1111181111111111\"\nRow5: \"1811111111111811\"\nRow6: \"8811111111118811\"\nRow7: \"1888111111111888\"\nRow8: \"1811111111111811\"\n\nMaybe the transformation involves merging two parts", "prompt_tokens": 1066, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's re-read e.g. 1 input and output:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n1488888888\n3288888888\n8800001000\n8801000000\n8800000101\n8800000000\n8800100100\n8800000100\n8801001000\n8800000001\n\nOutput:\n1488888888\n3288888888\n8800004000\n8801000000\n8800000404\n8800000000\n8800300200\n8800000200\n8803002000\n8800000002\n\nObserving differences between input and output:\nLine 1: 1488888888 remains unchanged.\nLine 2: 3288888888 remains unchanged.\nLine 3: input \"8800001000\" -> output \"8800004000\". So transformation seems to happen on some digits? The difference is at column 7? Let's check: \nInput row 3: digits: 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0, output row 3: 8 8 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0. So the '1' becomes '4'? But then row 4: \"8801000000\" -> output \"8801000000\" unchanged.\nRow 5: \"8800000101\" -> output \"8800000404\". Let's check: row 5: digits: 8,8,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1; output: 8,8,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4; transformation: 1 becomes 4, and last digit 1 becomes 4.\nRow 6: \"8800000000\" -> output \"8800000000\" unchanged.\nRow 7: \"8800100100\" -> output \"8800300200\". Let's check: digits: input row 7: 8,8,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0; output: 8,8,0,0,3,0,2,0,0,0. So transformation: first transformation: digit 1 in column 5 becomes 3? And digit 1 in column 8 becomes 2? Or maybe pattern: Each '1' becomes different digit? Look at row 3: digit at column 7 is 1 becomes 4. Row 5: digit at column 8 is 1 becomes 4, and digit at column 10 is 1 becomes 4. Row 7: digit at column 5 is 1 becomes 3, column 8 is 1 becomes 2. Row 9: \"8801001000\" -> output \"8803002000\". Let's check: row 9: digits: 8,8,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0; output: 8,8,0,3,0,0,2,0,0,0. So transformation: first digit '1' becomes 3, second digit '1' becomes 2. Row 10: \"8800000001\" -> output \"8800000002\": digit at last column: 1 becomes 2.\n\nSo, it seems rule is: Transform some occurrences of digit \"1\" into different digits. But what about row 2 remains same, row 1 remains same. Let's check if there are any other digits that change. In row 7, the digit 1 at col5 and col8 are replaced by 3 and 2 respectively. In row 9, the 1 at col3 becomes 3 and the 1 at col7 becomes 2. In row 3, the 1 at col7 becomes 4. In row 5, the 1 at col8 becomes 4 and the 1 at col10 becomes 4. Row 10, the 1 at col10 becomes 2.\nRow 4: contains \"8801000000\" but no 1? Actually row 4 is: 8,8,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0, but output remains same, so maybe the transformation doesn't apply when 1 is in position 4? Let's check row 4: It has \"8801000000\", but output \"8801000000\". But wait, row 4 did have a \"1\" at position 4 if we count index: Actually row 4: digits: index positions: 1st digit: 8, 2nd: 8, 3rd: 0, 4th: 1, 5th: 0, ... so there is a \"1\" at col4. But output row 4 remains same, meaning that transformation did not occur at col4? Let's check row 4: Input: \"8801000000\", output: \"8801000000\". So the \"1\" at col4 did not change. Also row 2 remains same even though it has \"1\"? Let's check row 2: \"3288888888\" has no 1? Actually row 2: digits: 3,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8, no 1's. Row 1: \"1488888888\" has a 1 at beginning. But output row 1 remains same: \"1488888888\". So why did row 1 not transform? Possibly transformation applies only to \"1\" that are not on the border? Let's check positions:\nRow 3: the only 1 is at col7, which is in interior. Transformation: becomes 4? \nRow 5: there are two 1's: one at col8 and one at col10. They both become 4.\nRow 7: has two 1's: one at col5 and one at col8. They become 3 and 2 respectively.\nRow 9: has two 1's: one at col3 and one at col7. They become 3 and 2 respectively.\nRow 10: has one 1: at col10 becomes 2.\n\nNow what about row 4's 1 at col4? It did not transform. Row 1's 1 did not transform.\nMaybe rule: replace all occurrences of 1 by a digit that depends on the number of times 1 appears in that row? Let's count each row:\n\nRow 1: has \"1\" at first digit. But output remains same \"1\". So count=1, but output digit remains 1, so no transformation maybe if count==1? But row 3 has count=1 but output becomes 4. Hmm.\n\nMaybe rule: transformation depends on location: maybe it's the Manhattan distance from a certain point? Possibly the rule: \"For each cell with value 1, add the row and column indices\" or something? Let's try: For row 3, col7: row=3, col=7, sum=10, but output digit is 4, not 10 mod something? Possibly (1 + row index)? For row 3, row index=3, then 1+3=4, that matches row 3 1 becomes 4. Let's test: row 5: 1 at col8: row index=5, 1+5=6, but output digit is 4, not 6.\nMaybe transformation is: value = 1 + (column index)? For row 3, col7: 1+7=8, not 4.\nMaybe transformation is: value = 1 + (row index)? As we already tested: row 3: 1+3=4, that works for row 3. Row 5: 1 at col8: 1+5=6, but output digit is 4, so no.\nPerhaps transformation is: value = 1 + (distance from center)? Let's check: The grid dimensions: In e.g.1, there are 10 rows and 10 columns. The center would be around row 5, col5 maybe? For row 3, col7: distance from center (5,5) is |3-5|+|7-5|=2+2=4, plus 1 equals 5, not 4. Alternatively, maybe it's: difference = col - row? For row 3, col7: 7-3=4, added to 1 gives 5, not 4.\n\nMaybe it depends on column index only: For row 3, col7: 7 mod something? For row 5: col8 => 8 mod something? Let's check row 7: It has two 1's: at col5 gives output digit 3, and col8 gives output digit 2. For row 9: at col3 gives output digit 3, at col7 gives output digit 2.\nObserving outputs:\nRow", "prompt_tokens": 711, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We need to deduce the transformation rule from the examples and then apply it to the final grid. Let me parse the given examples. We see three example sets: e.g. 1, e.g. 2, e.g. 3. They are not trivial ones, they are quite involved.\n\nLet's inspect E.g. 1: \nWe have input grid:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n```\n00000000000000000\n00000000000000000\n00000000000000000\n00000000000000000\n00000000000000000\n00000000000000000\n00080800000000000\n00080800000000000\n00080800000000000\n00080800000000000\n00000000000000000\n00000000000000000\n00000000000000000\n00000000000000000\n00000000000000000\n00000000000000000\n00000000003003000\n00000000003003000\n00000000003003000\n00000000000000000\n00000000000000000\n00000000000000000\n```\nWait, count rows: There are 21 rows. They are 20 columns each? Let's count digits: \"00000000000000000\" is likely 20 digits. So grid is 21 rows x 20 cols.\n\nThen E.g. 1 Output:\n```\n08003008000000000\n08003008000000000\n00800380000000000\n00800380000000000\n00800380000000000\n00800060000000000\n00080830000000000\n00080830000000000\n00080803000000003\n00080803000000003\n00800083000000003\n00800080300000030\n00800080300000030\n00800080300000030\n08000008030000300\n08000008030000300\n08000008030000300\n08000008003003000\n80000000803003000\n80000000803003000\n80000000830000300\n80000000830000300\n00000000060000300\n```\nLet's check: There are 22 rows in the output? Actually count rows: There are 22 rows. Yes. So input has 21 rows, output has 22 rows.

Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" The problem description: \"The user will provide several pairs of example input grids and their corresponding output grids. They represent a hidden transformation rule. Finally, a single test input grid is provided. Your goal is to deduce the rule from the examples and apply it to the test input grid to produce the correct test output grid.\"\n\nThen examples.\n\nThe provided examples are:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n757\n557\n775\nE.g. 1 Output:\n757757757757\n755557755557\n577775577775\n\nLet's look at example 1 carefully:\n\nInput grid is 3-digit lines:\nLine 1: \"757\"\nLine 2: \"557\"\nLine 3: \"775\"\nOutput grid is 12-digit lines:\nLine 1: \"757757757757\"\nLine 2: \"755557755557\"\nLine 3: \"577775577775\"\n\nWe want to determine transformation rule.\n\nObservations:\n- The output grid is a repetition of the input grid's rows? But not exactly: For example, output row1 is \"757757757757\", which is \"757\" repeated 4 times. But original row1 is \"757\". But output row2 is \"755557755557\". It's not exactly row2 repeated, maybe it's a transformation of each row? Let's check: Row2 input is \"557\", output row2: \"755557755557\". That is not equal to \"557\" repeated, because \"557\" repeated 4 times would give \"557557557557\", but actual is \"755557755557\". So what's the pattern? Possibly the transformation rule is that we take the input and reflect it horizontally and then vertically? Let's check row1: input row1 is \"757\". If we mirror horizontally, we get \"757\" reversed, but that's the same as \"757\" because it's symmetric? Actually, check: \"757\" reversed is \"757\". But then output row1 is \"757\" repeated 4 times. But then row2: input row2 \"557\", reversed is \"755\". And then output row2 is \"755557755557\", which can be seen as \"755\" (reversed row2) then \"557\" then \"755\"? Let's check: \"755\" + \"557\" + \"755\" equals \"755557755\". But output row2 is 12 digits, which is 4 times \"3-digit\" = 12 digits. But \"755557755\" is 9 digits. Not sure.\n\nLet's observe row1: \"757\" output row1 is \"757757757757\". That is exactly \"757\" repeated 4 times. So why row2 is different? Let's check row3: input row3 \"775\" output row3 \"577775577775\". If we reverse \"775\", we get \"577\". And then if we combine \"577\" with \"775\" in some pattern: maybe it's like: for row3, the output is \"577\" then \"775\" then \"577\"? That would be 3+3+3=9 digits, but output has 12 digits. Actually, check: \"577775577775\" split into 4 groups of 3 digits: \"577\", \"775\", \"577\", \"775\". So maybe the rule is: each row is repeated 4 times, but with alternating reversal. Look at row1: \"757\" repeated 4 times: but note if you reverse \"757\" you get \"757\", so it doesn't change.\nRow2: input row2 \"557\": reversed is \"755\". So pattern might be: output row = (reversed row) then (original row) then (reversed row) then (original row)? But that would yield \"755557755\" which is 9 digits, not 12. Let's check: For row2: if we do pattern: (reversed row) then (original row) then (reversed row) then (original row), that equals \"755557755\". But output row2 is \"755557755557\" which is 12 digits. Alternatively, maybe it's (reversed row) followed by (original row) repeated twice then (reversed row) repeated twice? That would equal \"755\" + \"557\" + \"557\" + \"755\" = \"755557557755\", which is not matching.\n\nLet's try to see pattern in digits count: The output grid is 12 characters per row, which is 4 times 3-digit input row length. So each row is expanded to 4 copies of some 3-digit sequence. Perhaps the transformation rule involves both horizontal and vertical transformations.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: replicate each row 4 times, but with alternating order: top half is the original order, bottom half is reversed order? Let's check example 1 rows:\nRow1 output: \"757757757757\": That is just row1 repeated 4 times. Row2 output: \"755557755557\": if we split into two halves: first half \"755557755\" and second half \"557\"? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's re-read the problem statement: \"The user will provide several pairs of example input grids and their corresponding output grids.\" So probably each example is a separate transformation. But then they give multiple examples e.g. 1, e.g. 2, etc. So the transformation rule might be different for each example? Wait, but they are labeled \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then \"E.g. 1 Output:\" etc. They might be separate tasks from ARC challenge, each with its own rule.\n\nWait, the task description: \"The user will provide several pairs of example input grids and their corresponding output grids. They represent a hidden transformation rule.\" And then \"Finally, a single test input grid is provided.\" So maybe the examples are separate problems? But then the final test input grid is provided. But then the examples are not all following the same rule. Instead, they are distinct ARC tasks. But the given examples are 4 examples, then the test input grid. They might be different transformation rules for each example? But then which one is the final test input? It says \"Test Input:\" then grid. Possibly the final test input corresponds to one of the examples? Looking at test input: \"857\n575\n885\" Compare with examples:\n\nE.g. 1: Input: 757, 557, 775.\nE.g. 2: Input: 778, 588, 588.\nE.g. 3: Input: 888, 557, 578.\nE.g. 4: Input: 887, 755, 578.\nTest Input: 857, 575, 885.\n\nMaybe there is a pattern: each row of output is 4 copies of something. It might be that the rule is: each row in the output is the input row repeated 4 times, but with a twist: the second copy is the mirror of the input row. Let's test that hypothesis on example 1: For row1 \"757\", mirror is \"757\" (because it's symmetric). So then row1 becomes: \"757\" (copy1), then \"757\" (mirror), then \"757\" (copy2), then \"757\" (mirror) gives \"757757757757\". That fits example 1 row1.\nTest example 1 row2: \"557\", mirror is \"755\". So then row2 becomes: \"557\" then \"755\" then \"557\" then \"755\" equals \"557755557755\". But actual output row2 is \"755557755557\". Wait, check: if we do \"557\" then \"755\" then \"557\" then \"755\", we get \"557755557755\". But the given output row2 is \"755557755557\". They differ by a swap of the first two groups. So maybe the order is: mirror, then original, then mirror, then original. Let's test that: For row2 \"557\": mirror \"755\", original \"557\", mirror \"755\", original \"557\" yields \"755557755557\". That matches example 1 row2.\nTest row3: \"775\", mirror is \"577\". Then mirror, original, mirror, original gives \"577775577775\". That matches example 1 row3. So rule for example 1 is: for each row, output is: mirror of the row, then the row, then mirror of the row, then the row. So rule: output row = reverse(row) + row + reverse(row) + row. And note that this produces a 12-digit string for each row (4 copies of 3-digit row). And this applies to each row independently.\n\nNow check example 2:\nE.g. 2 Input:\n778\n588\n588\nE.g. 2 Output:\n877778877778\n885588885588\n885588885588\n\nLet's apply our rule: For row1: \"778\". Mirror of \"778\" is \"877\". If we do mirror + original + mirror + original, we get: \"877778877778\". That matches output row1 exactly.\nFor row2: \"588\". Mirror is \"885\". Then mirror+original+mirror+original = \"885588885588\". That matches output row2.\nFor row3: same as row2, so same result.\n\nExample 3:\nE.g. 3 Input:\n888\n557\n578\nE.g. 3 Output:\n888888888888\n755557755557\n875578875578\n\nNow apply rule: For row1", "prompt_tokens": 525, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We have to deduce transformation rule from examples. Let's re-read the examples carefully. They are 2 examples. Let's parse them.\n\nFirst, look at Example 1:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n```\n00008055080000\n02208005080000\n02208555580000\n00008050080000\n88888888888888\n00008000080000\n03308000080000\n03308000080000\n00008000080000\n88888888888888\n00008000080000\n01108000080000\n01108000080000\n00008000080000\n```\nE.g. 1 Output:\n```\n02208022080220\n00208002080020\n22228222282222\n02008020080200\n88888888888888\n03308033080330\n00308003080030\n33338333383333\n03008030080300\n88888888888888\n01108011080110\n00108001080010\n11118111181111\n01008010080100\n```\n\nLet's analyze. The grid shapes: The E.g. 1 input grid is 15 rows x 14 columns? Actually count columns in first row: \"00008055080000\". Count digits: \"00008055080000\": length? Let's count: \"00008055080000\". Count: \"000080\" is 7 digits? Let's count: 0,0,0,0,8,0,0, then \"5508\" is 4 more digits, then \"0000\" is 4 digits. Wait that's not consistent. Let's count exactly: \"00008055080000\". I'll count characters manually: \n- There are characters: \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"8\", \"0\", \"0\", then \"5\", \"5\", \"0\", \"8\", then \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\". So total count = 4 + 2 + 2 + 4? Let's recount: Actually, I'll count positions: \n  Index: \n  0: '0'\n  1: '0'\n  2: '0'\n  3: '0'\n  4: '8'\n  5: '0'\n  6: '0'\n  7: '5'\n  8: '5'\n  9: '0'\n  10:'8'\n  11:'0'\n  12:'0'\n  13:'0'\n  14:'0'\nSo, length = 15 digits. So grid is 15 rows x 15 columns? Wait, let's check second line: \"02208005080000\": count digits: 0,2,2,0,8,0,0,5,0,8,0,0,0,0. That is 14 digits maybe? Let's count: Actually, count carefully: \"02208005080000\". Count characters:\n- characters: \"0\", \"2\", \"2\", \"0\", \"8\", \"0\", \"0\", \"5\", \"0\", \"8\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\". So length = 14. Check third row: \"02208555580000\": count: \"0\",\"2\",\"2\",\"0\",\"8\",\"5\",\"5\",\"5\",\"5\",\"5\",\"8\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\". That is 15 digits. It seems columns vary between 14 and 15? Let's check row 4: \"00008050080000\": count: \"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"8\",\"0\",\"0\",\"5\",\"0\",\"8\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\". That is 14 digits. So pattern: rows alternate 15 and 14 digits? Possibly these are each grid with 15 rows? Wait, we have 15 lines in total, and they alternate lengths: rows 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15 are 15-digit rows, rows 2,4,6,8,10,12,14 are 14-digit rows. However, in output, row lengths: first row: \"02208022080220\": count: digits: 0,2,2,0,8,0,2,2,0,8,0,2,2,0. Count = 14 digits. Second row: \"00208002080020\": count = 14, third row: \"22228222282222\": count = 14, fourth row: \"02008020080200\": count = 14, fifth row: \"88888888888888\": count = 14, sixth: \"03308033080330\": count = 14, seventh: \"00308003080030\": count = 14, eighth: \"33338333383333\": count = 14, ninth: \"03008030080300\": count = 14, tenth: \"88888888888888\": count = 14, eleventh: \"01108011080110\": count = 14, twelfth: \"00108001080010\": count = 14, thirteenth: \"11118111181111\": count = 14, fourteenth: \"01008010080100\": count = 14.\n\nSo the transformation from input to output apparently reduces the width by 1 column? Let's compare input and output row by row. Possibly the rule is: For each row, if the row originally has 15 digits, then remove the last digit? But check row 1: input row 1 is \"00008055080000\". Output row 1 is \"02208022080220\". They are not a simple substring. Let's compare positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: There are two distinct regions, maybe the top half and bottom half. Notice that in the input, there is a clear horizontal band: lines 1-4, then line 5 is \"88888888888888\", then lines 6-9, then line 10 is \"88888888888888\", then lines 11-14. And the output: row1-4, row5 is \"88888888888888\", row6-9, row10 is \"88888888888888\", row11-14. So the output has a similar structure: top block, middle block, bottom block. And the transformation seems to operate on each block separately? Possibly the rule is: For each non-8 region, the transformation is to \"mirror\" some digits or fill with complementary pairs.\n\nMaybe look at row 1: input: \"00008055080000\". Output: \"02208022080220\". How can we get from \"00008055080000\" to \"02208022080220\"? Let's align positions:\nInput row 1: digits positions: indexes 0 to 14:\nIndices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:8,5:0,6:0,7:5,8:5,9:0,10:8,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0.\nOutput row 1: \"02208022080220\": digits: index0:0,1:2,2:2,3:0,4:8,5:0,6:2,7:2,8:0,9:8,10:0,11:2,12:2,13:0 ? Wait, count output digits: \"02208022080220\" is 14 digits. But input row 1 is 15 digits. Possibly the transformation involves splitting the row into two halves and interleaving them or something.\n\nMaybe the rule is: The transformation takes each digit and replaces it with a new digit determined by its neighbors? Alternatively, maybe the rule is: For each digit in the input, if it's 0, then check left and right etc. But the examples \"88888888888888\" remain unchanged in the output in some rows. In e.g. 1, row 5 of input is \"88888888888888\" and output also \"88888888888888\". Also rows with \"888\" remain \"888\".\n\nMaybe rule is: mirror along vertical axis? For instance, row 1 input: \"00008055080000\". If we reverse it, we get \"00008055080000\" which is the same? It's palindromic? Actually check: \"00008055080000\" reversed is \"00008055080000\"? Let's check: first digit 0 last digit 0, second 0 and second last 0, etc. So row 1 input is symmetric. But output row 1 \"02208022080220\" is not obviously the same.\n\nMaybe rule is: replace each digit by a function f(d) that depends on its column parity. For instance, compare row 1: input: column indices: 0:0->? output[?]. Not sure.\n\nLet's compare row 1 input vs row 1 output:\nInput: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 5 5 0", "prompt_tokens": 1095, "completion_tokens": 2048}

There appear to be non-zero digits in certain positions. Let's list the coordinates (row, col) for non-zero digits.\n\nCoordinates: (0-based indexing) \n\nLooking at input grid for example 1:\nRow 0: \"00000000000000\" (all zeros)\nRow 1: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 2: \"00000002000000\" => col 6: '2'? Actually count digits: starting at index 0: digit positions: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:2,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0\nWait check: \"00000002000000\" length 14. Actually the given string \"00000002000000\" has 14 characters. Let's index: \nIndices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:2,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0.\nSo non-zero: row2, col7 is '2'.\n\nRow 3: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 4: \"00000000000000\"\nRow 5: \"00100000000000\" => row5: \"00100000000000\" has non-zero at col0: '0'? Actually let's check: row5: \"00100000000000\", but first two digits are zeros? Actually \"00100000000000\" starts with \"00\", then \"1\", then \"0000000000\"? Let's check carefully:\nRow 5: \"00100000000000\" has length 14. Characters: index0='0', index1='0', index2='1', index3='0', index4='0', index5='0', index6='0', index7='0', etc. So non-zero: row5, col2 is '1'? Wait, but then later: row8: \"00000000000400\" => row8: \"00000000000400\", non-zero: col? Let's index row8: \"00000000000400\": digits: index0:0, index1:0, 2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:4,13:0, so non-zero at row8, col12 is '4'? Actually wait, we have \"00000000000400\": length 14: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0. So non-zero: row8, col12 is '4'? But then also row11: \"23516400000000\" non-zero digits: row11: \"23516400000000\", digits: index0:2, index1:3, index2:5, index3:1, index4:6, index5:4, rest zeros.\n\nBut wait, the provided input example e.g. 1: appears to have many zeros except a few concentrated digits. Let's list non-zero coordinates with value:\nRow2: col7: '2'\nRow5: col2: '1'\nRow8: col12: '4'? Wait re-read row8: \"00000000000400\": Actually count digits: \"00000000000400\" is 14 digits: indices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:4,13:0.\nRow11: \"23516400000000\": indices: 0:2, 1:3, 2:5, 3:1, 4:6, 5:4, others zeros.\n\nNow, look at output grid for example 1:\nRow0: \"00000000000000\"\nRow1: \"00000000000000\"\nRow2: \"00000002351640\": non-zero digits at row2: \"00000002351640\" means: index0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:2,8:3,9:5,10:1,11:6,12:4,13:0.\nRow3: \"00000000000000\"\nRow4: \"00000000000000\"\nRow5: \"35164000000000\": row5: digits: index0:3,1:5,2:1,3:6,4:4,5:0, ... so non-zero digits at row5: \"351640\"\nRow6: \"00000000000000\"\nRow7: \"00000023516400\": row7: \"00000023516400\" means digits: index0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:2,7:3,8:5,9:1,10:6,11:4,12:0,13:0? Wait check: \"23516400\" length is 8, but there are 7 zeros preceding it? Let's count: \"00000023516400\": 6 zeros then \"23516400\" equals 8 digits, so total length 14? Actually \"000000\" is 6 zeros, then \"23516400\" is 8 digits, that sums to 14. So row7 has non-zeros at col6:2, col7:3, col8:5, col9:1, col10:6, col11:4, col12:0, col13:0? But then row7: \"00000023516400\" digits: index0-5:0, index6:2, index7:3, index8:5, index9:1, index10:6, index11:4, index12:0, index13:0.\nRow8: \"00000000000000\"\nRow9: \"00000000000000\"\nRow10: \"00000000000000\"\nRow11: \"23516400000000\": row11: \"23516400000000\": index0:2,1:3,2:5,3:1,4:6,5:4, rest zeros.\n\nSo what transformation did occur? It appears that the digits \"235164\" from row11 in input become repositioned in output: they appear in row2, col7 onward \"02351640\", in row5 become \"351640\", in row7 become \"23516400\", and row11 remains same? Wait, let's check: input row11 \"23516400000000\" remains same in output row11 \"23516400000000\"? Yes.\n\nBut then what about row2 \"00000002000000\" in input? In output row2, we see \"00000002351640\". So the \"2\" from row2 col7 in input becomes \"2\" in output row2 col7? But then extra \"351640\" appended? Actually, look at row2 in output: \"00000002351640\". Compare with input row2: \"00000002000000\". So row2 got extra digits \"351640\" appended at positions col8-col13? And row5 in output: \"35164000000000\" while input row5 was \"00100000000000\", which originally had a \"1\" at col2. So row5 output: \"351640\" but the input row5 had \"1\" only. Similarly, row7 output: \"00000023516400\" but input row7 was \"00000000000400\" with a \"4\" at col12? Not sure.\n\nLet's re-read example 1 carefully.\n\nInput lines (with row index):\n\nRow0: \"00000000000000\"\nRow1: \"00000000000000\"\nRow2: \"00000002000000", "prompt_tokens": 996, "completion_tokens": 2048}

And then a final test input grid.\n\nI need to deduce transformation rule from examples.\n\nLet's re-read examples carefully.\n\nE.g. 1 Input: It is given as lines. Let me denote them as rows. They are 20 rows? Actually, count rows? Let me count:\n\nGiven:\nE.g. 1 Input:\nLine1: \"00000000000000000\" (16 columns?) Actually count: \"00000000000000000\" length? \nWait, check: \"00000000000000000\" is 17 zeros? Actually, careful: There are \"00000000000000000\" - count digits. Possibly it's 17 digits? Let's count: \"00000000000000000\" if we count: 17 maybe. But later lines \"00111000000000000\" is 17 digits. Let's count: \"00000000000000000\" length: It has 17 digits (maybe 17 columns). But then there is \"00111011100011100\" row which has 17 digits? Let's check: \"00111011100011100\" count digits: 2 zeroes, then 3 ones, then 1 one, then 0, then 1, then 1, then 0? Let's count carefully: \"00111011100011100\": I'll count: digit by digit: 0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0. So it's 17 digits. So grid width is 17 columns.\n\nSo grid dimensions: There are 17 columns, and there are 20 rows (maybe).

The output from E.g. 1 has similar structure. The transformation rule: It seems to add 888 or 808 patterns in some rows.\n\nLet's observe differences between input and output in E.g. 1. It seems the rule is: In rows that have pattern \"001110\" or \"001010\" in some parts, the right part changes digits from input to output. Look at row4: input row4: \"00111000000000000\", output row4: \"00111088800088800\". Similarly row5: input \"00101000000000000\", output \"00101080800080800\". Row6: input \"00111000000000000\", output \"00111088800088800\". row9: input \"00111000000000000\", output \"00111088800088800\". row10: input \"00101000000000000\", output \"00101080800080800\". row11: input \"00111000000000000\", output \"00111088800088800\". row16: input \"00111011100011100\", output same? Actually, check row16: Input: \"00111011100011100\", output: \"00111011100011100\". So rule doesn't apply there maybe? row17: input \"00101010100010100\", output same? Actually, row17: input same as output? Wait, check row17 in E.g. 1: Input row17: \"00101010100010100\" but output row17: \"00101010100010100\". Actually the given examples: In E.g. 1, the rows that are changed are rows 4,5,6,9,10,11. They are modified to have a pattern \"888\" or \"808\" inserted in the middle of the row, replacing zeros? Let's compare row4 input: \"00111000000000000\" becomes \"00111088800088800\". The difference: The substring from column maybe index 7 to column something? Let's check column indexing: Let's number columns from 0 to 16. For row4: input \"00111000000000000\". What digits are replaced? In output, row4: \"00111088800088800\". \nLet's compare: \nIndices 0-5: \"001110\" remain same. Then positions 6-8? Let's check: Actually, output row4: \"00111088800088800\". Compare to input row4: \"00111000000000000\". \nMapping: \n- digits 0-5 are same \"001110\". \n- then next three digits become \"888\" instead of \"000\". \n- then digits 9-11 become \"000\" same as input? Wait, check: output row4: \"00111088800088800\". Let's partition: \"001110\" then \"888\" then \"000\" then \"888\" then \"00\". But input row4: \"001110\" then \"000000000000000\". Actually, let's compare lengths: both 17 characters. \nLet's align positions: \nOutput: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\nRow4 input: 0-5: 001110, then columns6: 0, column7: 0, column8: 0, then col9: 0, col10: 0, col11: 0, col12: 0, col13: 0, col14: 0, col15: 0, col16: 0\nBut output row4: \"00111088800088800\". Let's write indices:\nIndices: \n0: 0, 1:0, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:0, 6:8, 7:8, 8:8, 9:0, 10:0, 11:0, 12:8, 13:8, 14:8, 15:0, 16:0.\nSo the transformation: The input row had \"001110\" then \"00000000000000\". The output row has \"001110\" then \"888\" then \"000\" then \"888\" then \"00\". So pattern: Two blocks: The left part \"001110\" remains unchanged. Then the next block is \"888\" inserted, then the next block is \"000\" from the input that originally were zeros, then \"888\" inserted, then the last two digits \"00\" are same as input? But wait, why are there exactly two groups of inserted digits \"888\" and \"808\" in some rows? Let's check row5: input row5: \"00101000000000000\", output: \"00101080800080800\". Partition: first 6 digits: \"001010\" remain same. Then then next three digits become \"808\" instead of \"000\". Then next three digits remain \"000\"? Wait, let's check: row5 output: \"00101080800080800\". Partition: \"001010\" then \"808\" then \"000\" then \"808\" then \"00\". So pattern: For rows that start with \"001110\", the inserted block is \"888\" and for rows that start with \"001010\", the inserted block is \"808\". And then the pattern is: There are two such blocks inserted into the row. They are inserted in the same positions possibly relative to some structure. Let's check row6: input row6: \"00111000000000000\" becomes \"00111088800088800\" again.\nThen row9: similar pattern, row10: similar pattern, row11: similar pattern.\nAnd row16: input \"00111011100011100\" remains unchanged.\nRow17: input \"00101010100010100\" remains unchanged.\nRow18: input \"00111011100011100\" becomes? Actually, row18 in E.g. 1 output: \"00111011100011100\"? Wait, re-read E.g. 1 output: It is given as:\nRow16: 00111011100011100\nRow17: 00101010100010100\nRow18: 00111011100011100\nRow19: 00000000000000000\nRow20: 00000000000000000.\nSo only rows 4,5,6,9,10,11 changed", "prompt_tokens": 1212, "completion_tokens": 2048}

And then a test input grid. We are asked: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" We need to produce final test output grid in JSON list of lists format (like [[1,0]] but likely each row as string maybe as list of strings?) but we need to produce output grid as JSON list of lists. But the instructions: \"Output concise reasoning in <thinking> of 5 or less steps to arrive at the answer and output the final test grid (JSON list of lists, e.g., [[1,0]]) in <answer>.\" So we need to produce reasoning in <thinking> block and then final answer in <answer> block.\n\nWe are given two examples. Let's rewrite the examples in a more clear format. E.g. 1: We have 16 rows? Actually count lines: E.g. 1 input is:\n```\n0000000000000000000\n0001101000000000000\n0111141100000000000\n0111111110000000000\n0044444440000000000\n0111111100000000000\n0000111000000000000\n0000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000\n0000000220020000000\n0000002222422200000\n0000002242422220000\n0000022222422200000\n0000002222422220000\n0000022002022200000\n0000000000002200000\n0000000000000000000\n```\nAnd E.g. 1 output is:\n```\n0000000000000000000\n0001101000000000000\n0111141100000000000\n0111111110000000000\n0044444440000000000\n0111111110000000000\n0111141100000000000\n0001101000000000000\n0000000000000000000\n0000000220002200000\n0000002222422220000\n0000002242424220000\n0000022222422222000\n0000002222422220000\n0000022002020022000\n0000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000\n```\nObserving E.g. 1: The transformation appears to be some kind of \"flip\" horizontally or vertically, or maybe some symmetry?

Wait, check row5 input: \"0111111100000000000\", output row5: \"0111111110000000000\". So the left part \"01111111\" vs \"01111111\"? Count digits: Actually let me re-check: row5 input: \"0111111100000000000\" (17 digits?) Actually, count: They are 20 columns. Let me check: \"0000000000000000000\" is 20 digits. So row5 input \"0111111100000000000\" has 20 digits, but \"0111111110000000000\" has 21 digits? Let me count carefully. I need to count characters: The provided strings are likely fixed width. Let's count: \"0000000000000000000\" has 20 digits. \"0001101000000000000\" has 20 digits. \"0111141100000000000\" has 20 digits. \"0111111110000000000\" has 20 digits. \"0044444440000000000\" has 20 digits. \"0111111100000000000\" has 20 digits. \"0000111000000000000\" has 20 digits. \"0000000000000000000\" has 20 digits. \"0000000000000000000\" has 20 digits. \"0000000220020000000\" has 20 digits. \"0000002222422200000\" has 20 digits. \"0000002242422220000\" has 20 digits. \"0000022222422200000\" has 20 digits. \"0000002222422220000\" has 20 digits. \"0000022002022200000\" has 20 digits. \"0000000000002200000\" has 20 digits. \"0000000000000000000\" has 20 digits.\nNow check output: Row0 same. Row1 same. Row2 same. Row3 same. Row4 same.\nRow5 output: \"0111111110000000000\". Compare input row5: \"0111111100000000000\". So the difference is in the 10th character maybe? Let's index from 0: \nRow5 input: digits: 0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\nRow5 output: digits: 0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,? Let's check: \"0111111110000000000\" => digits: 0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So the difference is at index 8: input has 0, output has 1. \nRow6: input: \"0000111000000000000\", output: \"0111141100000000000\". Let's compare row6 input with row? Actually row6 output as provided is \"0111141100000000000\". Wait, check output row6: Actually E.g. 1 output row6 is \"0111141100000000000\". But row6 input is \"0000111000000000000\". So row6 output equals row? It seems row6 output is same as row2 input? Let's check: row2 input: \"0111141100000000000\" equals row6 output. And row7 output is \"0001101000000000000\", which equals row1 input.\nLet's check: row1 input \"0001101000000000000\" appears in output row7. row? Check: Actually, let's sequence:\nRows 0-4 unchanged.\nRow5 output is modified compared to input row5 (one digit changed).\nRow6 output equals row2 input.\nRow7 output equals row1 input.\nRow8 output equals row? output row8 is \"0000000000000000000\" equals row? row8 input is same.\nRow9: input \"0000000220020000000\" vs output \"0000000220002200000\". So row9 output: looks like it's mirror-symmetric around the center column? Let's check: input row9: left part \"000000022\" then \"002000000\" maybe. Let's see: \"0000000220020000000\"\nBreak into halves: It might be that the transformation is: reflect vertically the top half to the bottom half?

The transformation rule is unknown. We are provided with five pairs of input and output examples, each pair labelled as E.g. 1, E.g. 2, etc. And then we are given a Test Input grid. We need to deduce transformation rule from examples and output final grid.\n\nLet's re-read examples:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n2002\n2222\n2002\n0202\n\nOutput:\nWait, output is a multi-line string? Let's parse the given output lines.

Let's count columns manually: \"2002000000002002\" length? Let's count digits: \"2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 2\"? Actually, let's recount: \"2002000000002002\" starts with \"2\",\"0\",\"0\",\"2\", then \"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\", then \"0\",\"0\",\"0\",\"0\"? Let's count properly:\n\nLine: \"2002000000002002\". Count digits: There are 16 digits. So the output grid is 16x16.\nInput grid is 4x4. So rule seems to produce a transformation from a 4x4 grid to 16x16 grid or composite grids? Let's check pattern: Output grid seems to be arranged in 4 quadrants each of 4 rows? But 16 rows divided into 4 groups of 4 rows. Similarly columns: 16 columns divided into 4 groups of 4 columns. And each quadrant is a transformation of corresponding input quadrant? Let's check pattern.\n\nLet's denote input as matrix A of size 4x4. Then maybe the output is composed of 4 copies of the input placed in a certain arrangement? But look at E.g. 1: The first four rows of output are:\nRow1: 2002000000002002\nRow2: 2222000000002222\nRow3: 2002000000002002\nRow4: 0202000000000202\nThey are 16 columns. If we break them into 4 blocks of 4 columns each, we get:\nBlock1: columns 1-4: \"2002\"\nBlock2: columns 5-8: \"0000\"\nBlock3: columns 9-12: \"0000\"? Wait, let's recalc: Actually, if we partition by 4 columns: first 4 digits \"2002\", then next 4 \"0000\", then next 4 \"0000\"? But the output row1 \"2002000000002002\" can be segmented as: \nSegment1: digits[1:4] = \"2002\"\nSegment2: digits[5:8] = \"0000\"\nSegment3: digits[9:12] = \"0000\"\nSegment4: digits[13:16] = \"2002\"? That pattern: row1 output equals: top-left block equals input row1, bottom-right block equals input row1 again, and the middle blocks are all zeros. Let\u2019s check row2: \"2222000000002222\" segmented: \nSegment1: \"2222\" (which equals input row2? Actually, input row2 is \"2222\")\nSegment2: \"0000\"\nSegment3: \"0000\"\nSegment4: \"2222\" equals input row2.\n\nRow3: \"2002000000002002\" equals input row3 (\"2002\"), row4: \"0202000000000202\" equals input row4 (\"0202\"). So pattern: first 4 rows of output are arranged as a 4x4 block in top left and bottom right corners, with the middle 8 columns filled with zeros.\n\nThen rows 5-8 of output:\nRow5: \"2002200220022002\"\nSegment1: \"2002\" equals input row1? But wait, row5: \"2002200220022002\", break into 4 groups of 4: group1: \"2002\", group2: \"2002\", group3: \"2002\", group4: \"2002\". That equals input row1 repeated four times.\n\nRow6: \"2222222222222222\": each group \"2222\", equals input row2 repeated four times.\nRow7: \"2002200220022002\": equals input row3 repeated four times.\nRow8: \"0202020202020202\": equals input row4 repeated four times.\n\nThen rows 9-12 of output:\nRow9: \"2002000000002002\" equals input row1\nRow10: \"2222000000002222\" equals input row2\nRow11: \"2002000000002002\" equals input row3\nRow12: \"0202000000000202\" equals input row4\n\nThen rows 13-16 of output:\nRow13: \"0000200200002002\": break into 4 groups: group1: \"0000\"? Actually \"0000\" not equal to input row? Let's segment row13: digits: \"0000 2020 0000 2002\"? Wait, let's break properly: row13: \"0000200200002002\". Partition into blocks of 4: block1: \"0000\", block2: \"2020\", block3: \"0000\", block4: \"2002\". Row13 equals: block1 is zeros, block2 is \"2020\" which is input row? Possibly input row2? Because input row2 is \"2222\", no.\nWait recalc: We have input grid for E.g. 1: \nRow1: 2002\nRow2: 2222\nRow3: 2002\nRow4: 0202\n\nLet's check row13: \"0000200200002002\". Partition: columns: 1-4: \"0000\", 5-8: \"2020\", 9-12: \"0000\", 13-16: \"2002\". That row equals: block1: zeros, block2: \"2020\", block3: zeros, block4: equals row1 (\"2002\"). And row14: \"0000222200002222\": block1: \"0000\", block2: \"2222\", block3: \"0000\", block4: \"2222\". Row15: \"0000200200002002\": block1: \"0000\", block2: \"2020\", block3: \"0000\", block4: \"2002\". Row16: \"0000020200000202\": block1: \"0000\", block2: \"2020\", block3: \"0000\", block4: \"0202\".\nSo it appears the rule is to compose four copies of the input arranged in the corners. Let\u2019s check pattern in E.g. 2.\n\nE.g. 2:\nInput:\n0001\n0110\n0000\n0001\n\nOutput:\nRow1: \"0000000000000001\": Partition into 4 blocks: block1: \"0000\", block2: \"0000\", block3: \"0000\", block4: \"0001\". So row1 equals input row1 in the rightmost block.\nRow2: \"0000000000000110\": equals input row2 in rightmost block.\nRow3: \"0000000000000000\": equals input row3 in rightmost block? Actually row3 \"0000000000000000\" partition: block1: \"0000\", block2: \"0000\", block3: \"0000\", block4: \"0000\".\nRow4: \"0000000000000001\": equals input row4 in rightmost block.\nRow5: \"0000000100010000\": Partition: block1: \"0000\", block2: \"0000\", block3: \"1001\" maybe equals input row? Wait, let's check: \"0000000100010000\" can be seen as: block1: \"0000\", block2: \"0000\", block3: \"1001\", block4: \"0000\". And input row1 is \"0001\", row2 is \"0110\", row3 is \"0000\", row4 is \"0001\". So block3 equals maybe input row? \"1001\" is not equal to any row though.\nLet's re-read the output for E.g. 2 in detail. It is a 16x16 grid. Let's note the structure: The output grid is divided into four quadrants (each quadrant is 8 rows x 8 columns) maybe, and each quadrant is composed of two parts? Let's try to structure: The output grid has 16 rows and 16 columns. We can see a pattern: The output grid is built by taking the 4x4 input grid and \"blowing it up\" in a fractal pattern. Common transformation in ARC tasks: Often the rule is to take the input grid and reflect it horizontally, vertically, or make copies in the quadrants.\n\nI recall a", "prompt_tokens": 1081, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Wait, check: The provided examples are ambiguous? Let me re-read the problem statement: \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then lists \"444410000\" etc. Wait, look at the problem: \"Provided Input/Output examples\" maybe the grid dimensions are not same? Let's re-read the problem statement carefully:\n\n\"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\"\n\nWe have several examples: E.g. 1 Input/Output, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, E.g. 4, E.g. 5. They are similar shape? They are likely to be 6 rows by 9 columns? Wait, check e.g. 1: The input lines \"444410000\" is 9 digits? Actually count: \"444410000\" length = 9 digits. \"040414000\" length=9. \"400010400\" length=9. \"044010000\" length=9. \"404014444\" length=9. \"044410000\" length=9. So input grid is 6 rows by 9 columns. But the output lines are \"8888\" which is 4 digits, \"8808\" 4 digits, \"8800\" 4 digits, \"0880\" 4 digits, \"8888\" 4 digits, \"0888\" 4 digits. So output grid has shape 6 rows by 4 columns. So rule reduces width from 9 to 4? Or maybe it's a transformation of some pattern? Let us check e.g. 2: Input lines: \"004410044\" (9 digits), \"044410000\", \"040014040\", \"044414404\", \"044414044\", \"040414000\". Output: \"0088\", \"0888\", \"8880\", \"8888\", \"8888\", \"8808\". So output grid is 6 rows by 4 columns. E.g.3: Input: \"404014044\" (9-digit), \"404014440\", \"440414040\", \"040014004\", \"004414440\", \"440414000\". Output: \"8088\", \"8880\", \"8888\", \"8808\", \"8888\", \"8808\". E.g.4: Input: \"000414400\" (9 digits), \"004410400\", \"404410440\", \"444014400\", \"404414004\", \"000014444\". Output: \"8808\", \"0888\", \"8888\", \"8880\", \"8088\", \"8888\". E.g.5: Input: \"400410404\", \"004410400\", \"404414040\", \"040414044\", \"440410440\", \"044410404\". Output: \"8808\", \"0888\", \"8088\", \"8888\", \"8888\", \"0888\". And test input: \"004010040\", \"404414404\", \"000414404\", \"404014440\", \"040014444\", \"440410404\". The output grid should be 6 rows by 4 columns.\n\nSo transformation: input grid is 6x9, output grid is 6x4. So the operation likely extracts some \"submatrix\" from the input? Perhaps the rule is to take the first, fourth, seventh, and ninth columns? Let's check: For e.g. 1: Input \"444410000\": If we take columns 1,4,7,9? Let's check: positions: if columns are indexed 1-based: then column 1 digit = 4, column 4 digit = 4, column 7 digit = 0, column 9 digit = 0. That gives \"4400\", not \"8888\". Hmm.\n\nMaybe rule: counting something? The digits in input are either '0' or '4' mostly, sometimes '1'? And outputs digits are either '8' or '0'? They are different symbols: input uses 0,1,4; output uses 8 and 0. Possibly transformation: map 4 -> 8, map 0 -> 0, and maybe 1 becomes something? But check: In e.g. 1, input \"444410000\": if transformation was mapping every '4' to '8' and every '0' to '0', then we'd get \"888880000\". But output is \"8888\". So maybe they are compressing columns?\n\nMaybe transformation: From the 9 columns, some columns are dropped. Possibly the output is a condensed version. Let's check e.g.1: Input rows:\nRow1: \"444410000\"\nRow2: \"040414000\"\nRow3: \"400010400\"\nRow4: \"044010000\"\nRow5: \"404014444\"\nRow6: \"044410000\"\n\nOutput rows:\nRow1: \"8888\"\nRow2: \"8808\"\nRow3: \"8800\"\nRow4: \"0880\"\nRow5: \"8888\"\nRow6: \"0888\"\n\nMaybe they are picking columns 1, 2, 5, 9? Let's try: For row1: If we take column1: '4', column2: '4', column5: '1'? But then mapping maybe: 4 becomes 8, 1 becomes ? But then row1: if we pick columns: maybe columns 1, 3, 7, 9? That gives: row1: col1 '4', col3 '4', col7 '0', col9 '0' -> 4,4,0,0 mapping to 8,8,0,0 gives \"8800\" but output is \"8888\". Alternatively, maybe summing columns? Let's analyze each row's transformation.\n\nIdea: The outputs are 4-digit numbers composed solely of 8's and 0's. They seem to be binary-like patterns maybe representing corners? Possibly the output is produced by compressing the input by an operation such as \"count the number of 4's in groups of 3 columns\" or something.\n\nMaybe the rule is \"compress columns by taking the maximum value in each group of columns\". For e.g. 1, if we group the 9 columns into groups of 3 columns each, then we get 3 groups per row, and then output is 3 groups? But output has 4 columns, not 3 groups. Alternatively, maybe group them as 3 columns to form 3 numbers, then add something? Let's check: For row1: \"444410000\". If we break into groups of 3 columns: group1: \"444\", group2: \"410\", group3: \"000\". Then maybe rule: if group has all 4's, then output 8? But group1 \"444\" becomes 8 maybe, group2 \"410\" becomes 8? group3 \"000\" becomes 8? That would yield \"888\", but output is \"8888\", 4 digits. Alternatively, maybe group into groups of columns in a different way.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Replace every '4' with '8' and every '0' with '0', but then remove the '1's\"? But row1: \"444410000\" becomes \"888880000\" if we simply map 4->8, 0->0, and 1 stays 1? But output is \"8888\". So maybe then take the leftmost 4 columns after replacement? But then row1: \"888880000\" leftmost 4 columns = \"8888\". Check row2: \"040414000\" -> map: 0->0, 4->8, 0->0, 4->8, 1->? maybe 1->? But if we just drop 1? But then row2 becomes \"0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0\" = \"080808000\". Taking leftmost 4 digits gives \"0808\", but output row2 is \"8808\". So that doesn't match.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Take the central 4 columns of the input after mapping 4->8 and 0->0\"? For row1: if we take columns 3-6? Let's test: row1: \"444410000\", columns 3-6: \"4410\". But", "prompt_tokens": 683, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check coordinates maybe. Coordinates: Let's denote rows as 0-indexed from top, columns likewise.\n\nE.g.1: Possibly transformation rule: It seems the output grid is similar to input grid but with some digits rotated or shifted. Let's check: Compare input to output.\n\nInput row 1: \"0000000000000\" vs output row 1: \"0000000000000\", same.\nRow 2: Input: \"0022000000000\" vs output: \"0000000002200\". So what happened? \"002200\" becomes \"000000\" and then \"2200\" at the end maybe? But wait, let's check details:\n\nInput row 2: digits: positions: (2nd row: index columns: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ? Actually, count digits: Row2: \"0022000000000\" has length 14: positions: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0? Let's index columns: index0=0, index1=0, index2=2, index3=2, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0, index7=0, index8=0, index9=0, index10=0, index11=0, index12=0, index13=0.\n\nOutput row 2: \"0000000002200\": positions: index0=0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=0, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0, index7=0, index8=0, then index9=2, index10=2, index11=0, index12=0. So digits \"22\" moved from column2-3 to col9-10? But then what about zeros? Wait, check row 8: Input row8: \"0660008000000\" vs output row8: \"0000000000668\": positions: Input row8: digits: \"0,6,6,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\", output row8: \"0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,8\"? So row8's digits \"66\" become \"666\"? But wait, \"8\" becomes \"8\"? Let's analyze row8:\nInput row8: \"0660008000000\". Count positions: pos0:0, pos1:6, pos2:6, pos3:0, pos4:0, pos5:0, pos6:8, pos7:0, pos8:0, pos9:0, pos10:0, pos11:0, pos12:0, pos13:0.\nOutput row8: \"0000000000668\": positions: pos0:0, pos1:0, pos2:0, pos3:0, pos4:0, pos5:0, pos6:0, pos7:0, pos8:0, pos9:0, pos10:6, pos11:6, pos12:6, pos13:8.\nSo row8: digits are moved: originally row8 had \"66\" at pos1-2 and \"8\" at pos6. In output row8, we see \"666\" at the end? Actually, output row8: digits at pos10, pos11, pos12 are 6,6,6. So maybe the transformation is: each row might be rotated right by some columns offset? But row2: Input row2: \"0022000000000\", if we rotate it right by some number, then \"002200\" becomes \"000000\" and then \"2200\"? But wait, let's check rotation: In row2, if we rotate right by 7 positions, then last 7 digits become the first 7 digits. But that doesn't match.\n\nMaybe it's not row-wise rotation; maybe it's column-wise shifting? Let's check columns: Compare column by column maybe.\n\nLet's consider coordinates relative to center? The transformation seems to move digits from one part to another. Let's check the pattern: In e.g.1, look at nonzero digits: They are: row2: digits \"22\" at col2, col3 become row2: \"22\" at col9, col10 in output. Row3: digits \"2000550000\" become row3: \"0000255\"? Wait, let's check row3 of e.g.1 more carefully.\n\nRow3 input: \"0002000550000\"\nIndices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:2,4:0,5:0, then \"0550000\". Wait, let's rewrite row3 input: \"0002000550000\". Actually, count digits: It should be 14 digits. Let me count: row3: \"0002000550000\" -> digits: index0=0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=2, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0, index7=0, index8=5, index9=5, index10=0, index11=0, index12=0, index13=0. But the provided output row3 is \"0000000000255\". That means row3 output: index0=0,1=0,2=0,3=0,4=0,5=0,6=0,7=0,8=0, index9=2, index10=5, index11=5, index12=0, index13=0. So transformation from row3 input to row3 output: The digit \"2\" from input row3 col3 moved to output row3 col9, and the \"55\" from input row3 col8-9 moved to output row3 col10-11? But note, in input row3, we had \"2\" at col3 and \"55\" at col8-9. And in output row3, we see \"2\" at col9 and \"55\" at col10-11. And row2 had \"22\" at col2-3 moved to col9-10, and row4: Input row4: \"0000000550000\" -> digits \"55\" at col8-9 become output row4: \"0000000000055\" -> digits \"55\" at col12-13. Row5: Input row5: \"0000330000000\" -> digits \"33\" at col? Actually, row5: input: \"0000330000000\", meaning \"33\" at col? Let's count indices: row5: (0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:3,5:3, then zeros). Output row5: \"0000000000033\" -> digits \"33\" at col12-13. Row6: Input row6: \"0000300000000\" -> digits \"30\" at col? Actually row6: \"0000300000000\": \"3\" at col? Let's count: row6: index0=0,1=0,2=0, index3=0, index4=3, index5=0, then zeros. Output row6: \"0000000000030\" -> digits \"30\" at col12-13. Row8: Input row8: \"0660008000000\" -> digits \"66\" at col1-2 and \"8\" at col6. In output row8: \"0000000000668\", we see \"668\" at col10-12? Wait, but output row8: \"0000000000668\": digits: index10=6, index11=6, index12=6, index13=8? But that's 4 digits, not 3. But input row8 had two 6's and one 8,", "prompt_tokens": 663, "completion_tokens": 2048}

There are repeated sequences like \"303300\" in E.g. 2 and \"033300\" and \"330000\". In E.g. 1 and E.g. 3, there are \"3\", \"6\", \"8\", \"4\". In E.g. 4, there are \"8\", \"0\", \"3\", etc. So the transformation rule might be drawing diagonal lines or maybe reflect some symmetrical pattern across the grid? Possibly rule: \"Replace each contiguous region of same nonzero digit with a different digit, maybe based on count, location, or orientation?\" Alternatively, maybe it's \"mirroring\" some parts of the input horizontally or vertically. Let's check E.g. 2: input row4 \"101100\" becomes output \"303300\". Row4 input: \"101100\". Output: \"303300\". How can 101100 map to 303300? Possibly, it might be summing pairs: 1+0=1? But 1 becomes 3? Not sure.\n\nLet's compare E.g. 2 row4 input: \"101100\". If we split into halves: \"101\" and \"100\". But output \"303300\" can be split into \"303\" and \"300\". Similarly, check row5: input \"011100\" becomes output \"033300\". That is a shift: maybe each digit is transformed: 0 remains 0, 1 becomes 3, maybe? But then row6: input \"110000\" becomes output \"330000\". That means 1 becomes 3. But then row7 and row8 are all zeros.\n\nNow check E.g. 1 row4: input \"1111000000000000\" becomes output \"3333000000000000\". That fits: 1 is turned into 3. And row5: input \"0001000077000000\" becomes output \"0003000000000000\"? Actually row5 output is \"0003000000000000\". Let's check: Input row5: \"0001000077000000\". The output row5: \"0003000000000000\". So what happened? The first \"1\" becomes \"3\", and", "prompt_tokens": 1008, "completion_tokens": 2048}

But then next lines are given. Let's check: E.g. 1 Input: \n```\n000200000020000\n002020000202000\n000200000020000\n000000000000000\n000000000020000\n000000000202000\n000000000020000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n```\nIt is 10 lines, each line is a string with length 15? Actually, count digits: \"000200000020000\" length: 15 digits? Actually count: \"000200000020000\" has 15 digits. Wait check: \"000200000020000\" is 15 digits. Actually count: \"0\" repeated 3 times, then \"2\", then \"00000\", then \"020000\"? Wait recalc: \"000200000020000\" I'll count: positions: digits: index0=0,1=0,2=0,3=2,4=0,5=0,6=0,7=0,8=0,9=0,10=2,11=0,12=0,13=0,14=0. So yes 15 digits.\n\nE.g. 1 Output: \n\n```\n000200000020000\n002021111202000\n000200000020000\n000000000010000\n000000000020000\n000000000202000\n000000000020000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n```\n\nObservations: Compare input and output (for e.g. 1):\n\nInput:\nLine 1: \"000200000020000\" vs Output: \"000200000020000\". So line 1 unchanged.\nLine 2: \"002020000202000\" changed to \"002021111202000\". So what's changed: \"002020000202000\" -> \"002021111202000\". The changed block: The \"202000\" part? Actually, let's look at positions:\nIndices: \n- The string \"002020000202000\": positions: 0:0,1:0,2:2,3:0,4:2,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:2,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0?\nWait, let me do index positions:\n\"002020000202000\"\nIndex: 0: 0,1: 0,2: 2,3: 0,4: 2,5: 0,6: 0,7: 0,8: 0,9: 0,10:2,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0.\nOutput:\n\"002021111202000\"\nIndices: 0:0,1:0,2:2,3:0,4:2,5:1,6:1,7:1,8:1,9:1,10:2,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0.\nSo difference: indices 5 to 9 changed from \"00000\" to \"11111\". And then line 4: \"000000000000000\" becomes \"000000000010000\". That means middle digits changed: \"000000000000000\" -> \"000000000010000\". So index positions: Which index changed? Let's check: \"000000000010000\" means the digit \"1\" appears where? Counting: \"000000000010000\" -> maybe index 9 is 1? Let's check: string: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0. So digit \"1\" at index 10? Let's count: Actually, wait, let me re-read it: \"000000000010000\". Count digits: They are 15 digits. The first 9 digits are zeros? Actually, \"000000000\" is 9 zeros, then \"1\", then \"0000\" is 4 zeros, so total 9+1+4=14... Wait, 9+1+4=14, not 15. Let's count carefully:\n\"000000000010000\" count: \ncharacters: \n\"0\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" \"1\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\" \"0\". That's 15 digits: indices 0-8: zeros, index 9: '1', indices 10-14: zeros. So the transformation on line 4: changed from all zeros to a single 1 in column index 9.\n\nThen line 5: \"000000000020000\" unchanged? Actually e.g. 1 output: line 5 is \"000000000020000\" same as e.g. input? Input line 5: \"000000000020000\". Yes same.\nLine 6: \"000000000202000\" unchanged.\nLine 7: \"000000000020000\" unchanged.\nLine 8: \"000000000000000\" unchanged.\nLine 9: \"000000000000000\" unchanged.\nLine 10: \"000000000000000\" unchanged.\n\nNow let's examine e.g. 2:\nE.g. 2 Input:\nLine1: \"000000000000000\"\nLine2: \"000000000000000\"\nLine3: \"0002000020000200\"\nLine4: \"0020200202002020\"\nLine5: \"0002000020000200\"\nLine6: \"000000000000000\"\nLine7: \"000000000000000\"\nLine8: \"000000000000000\"\nLine9: \"0000000020000000\"\nLine10: \"0020000202000000\"\nLine11: \"0202000020000000\"\nLine12: \"0020000000000000\"\nLine13: \"000000000000000\"\nLine14: \"000000000000000\"\nLine15: \"000000000000000\"\nWait, check counts: The provided e.g. 2 input lines: Actually, it says e.g. 2 Input: (there are 15 lines, each line 16 digits? Let's check one line: \"0002000020000200\" is 16 digits, so grid is 15x16.)\nE.g. 2 Output:\nLine1: \"0000000000000000\" (unchanged? Actually input line1 \"0000000000000000\" is same as output line1 \"0000000000000000\".)\nLine2: \"0000000000000000\" (unchanged)\nLine3: \"0002000020000200\" (unchanged)\nLine4: \"0020211202112020\" changed from \"0020200202002020\". Compare line 4: input \"0020200202002020\". Output \"0020211202112020\". So difference: indices? Let's check: input: \"0020200202002020\"\nIndices: 0:0,1:0,2:2,3:0,4:2,5:0,6:0,7:2,8:0,9:0,10:2,11:0,12:2,13:0,14:2,15:0? Wait, need to count carefully. Actually, output is \"0020211202112020\". Let's label indices for output:\nIndex:0:0,1:0,2:2,3:0,4:2,5:1,6:1,7:1,8:2,9:1,10:1,11:2,12:0,13:2,14:1,15:0.\nSo difference: In input, how many digits? Input line4: \"0020200202002020\" count digits: positions: 0:0,1:0,2:2,3:0,4:2,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:2,9:0,10:0,11:2,12:0,13:2,14:0,15:20? Wait, no, let's re-read: \"0020200202002020\". Counting digits: \n- It starts with \"00\", then \"202\", then \"002\", then \"020\", then \"20\"? Actually, let me count: \"0020200202002020\" length = 16.\nIndices:\n0: '0'\n1: '0'\n2: '2'\n3: '0'\n4: '2'\n5: '0'\n6: '0'\n7: '0'\n8: '2'\n9: '0'\n10: '0'\n11: '2'\n12: '0'\n13: '2'\n14: '0'\n15: '20'? That doesn't parse. Let's re-read the input exactly: \"0020200202002020\". It might be \"002", "prompt_tokens": 935, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Our task: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" The examples are provided in the exercise text as example 1 and example 2. Let's re-read them: (I must check carefully)\n\nWe have:\n\n\"For example 1: \nInput:\n\"030\n077\n000\"\nOutput:\n\"003300\n003300\n007777\n007777\n000000\n000000\"\n\nWait, let me re-read: Actually, the text says: \"E.g. 1 Input: \n030\n077\n000\nE.g. 1 Output:\n003300\n003300\n007777\n007777\n000000\n000000\"\n\nWait, what is the transformation? Let's examine example 1: The input grid is given as, shape? Actually, reading carefully: \"E.g. 1 Input:\n030\n077\n000\". So that's a grid with three rows, each row has 3 characters? Actually, note that the digits are given as string. The input is a 3x3 grid? Actually, wait: \"030\" is the first row, \"077\" is the second row, \"000\" is the third row. The digits are: row0: 0, 3, 0; row1: 0, 7, 7? Correction: Actually, \"077\" has three digits: 0, 7, 7. Row2: \"000\" has three digits: 0, 0, 0.\n\nThe output: \"E.g.1 Output:\n003300\n003300\n007777\n007777\n000000\n000000\"\nWait, that looks like a grid with 6 rows, each row with 6 digits. But the provided output lines \"003300\" is 6 digits, \"003300\", \"007777\", \"007777\", \"000000\", \"000000\".\n\nWait, let me re-read: \"E.g. 1 Output: 003300, 003300, 007777, 007777, 000000, 000000\" So that's 6 rows of length 6.\n\nSo transformation from 3x3 input to 6x6 output. Similarly, example 2: Input:\n\"0080\n0855\n0005\n0000\" That's a grid with 4 rows, each row has 4 characters? Let's check: \"0080\" is 4 characters, \"0855\" is 4, \"0005\" is 4, \"0000\" is 4. So input is 4x4. And output is:\n\"00008800\n00008800\n00885555\n00885555\n00000055\n00000055\n00000000\n00000000\"\nThat is 8 rows of 8 columns. So the transformation seems to double the dimensions? Wait, check: In example 1: input 3x3 becomes output 6x6. In example 2: input 4x4 becomes output 8x8. So rule: double the size in both dimensions. But then what transformation is applied? Let's compare.\n\nFor example 1: Input: row0: \"030\", row1: \"077\", row2: \"000\". Output: The output grid, each cell, seems to be a 2x2 block corresponding to each input cell, but with some modifications.\n\nLet's check first row cells. In output, the top-left 2x2 block is \"00\" on row0? Actually, look at output: \"003300\": That row is \"00 33 00\", but wait, that's row 0 of output? Let's re-read: The output grid is 6 rows x 6 columns. It might be structured as 2*3 rows and 2*3 columns. So each cell in the input grid is replaced by a 2x2 block in the output grid, but then some digits are replaced? Let's check: In example 1, input \"0\" becomes \"00\" in the corresponding block? But then \"3\" becomes \"33\"? And \"7\" becomes \"77\"? And \"0\" remains \"00\"? Wait, but then the output has row0: \"003300\" which could be interpreted as: block for (0,0) is \"00\", block for (0,1) is \"33\", block for (0,2) is \"00\".\nRow1: \"003300\" again: block for (1,0) is \"00\", block for (1,1) \"33\", block for (1,2) \"00\".\nRow2: \"007777\": That would be block for (2,0) is \"00\", block for (2,1) \"77\", block for (2,2) \"77\"? But wait, the second row of input is \"077\". So the cell (0,1) is 3, so it becomes 33; (0,2) is 0 becomes 00. For row1 input \"077\": cell (1,0) is 0 becomes 00; cell (1,1) is 7 becomes 77; cell (1,2) is 7 becomes 77.\nRow2 input \"000\": cell (2,0) is 0 becomes 00; (2,1) is 0 becomes 00; (2,2) is 0 becomes 00.\nBut wait, then why does row2 in output become \"007777\"? Let's check the output rows carefully by splitting them into 2x2 blocks if possible:\n\nWe have output 6 rows and 6 columns. They can be partitioned into 3 rows of blocks and each block is 2 columns wide. So row indices: block row 0: output rows 0 and 1; block row 1: output rows 2 and 3; block row 2: output rows 4 and 5.\nAnd columns: 3 blocks of 2 columns each.\n\nLet's label each input cell with coordinates (r, c) and see what block it should produce.\n\nFor input example 1, input grid:\n\nRow0: [0, 3, 0]\nRow1: [0, 7, 7]\nRow2: [0, 0, 0]\n\nNow, if we double each cell, then each cell (r, c) becomes a 2x2 block with the same digit repeated. But then check: For (0,0) with 0, the block becomes 00 in each of the two rows. That matches output: top-left block is \"00\" in rows 0 and 1, column 0-1. For (0,1) with 3, the block becomes \"33\". But in output, in the top row of block row 0, columns 2-3 are \"33\". That fits. For (0,2) with 0, block becomes \"00\", and that appears in top row, columns 4-5 as \"00\". Then row1 of block row 0, columns 0-1 should be \"00\" but wait, the output row 1 is \"003300\": columns 0-1 \"00\", columns 2-3 \"33\", columns 4-5 \"00\". So that fits.\n\nNow block row 1: corresponds to input row1: [0, 7, 7]. Then block for (1,0) is 0 => \"00\". So in output rows 2-3, columns 0-1: \"00\". Then block for (1,1) is 7 => \"77\". So output rows 2-3, columns 2-3: \"77\". Then block for (1,2) is 7 => \"77\". So output rows 2-3, columns 4-5: \"77\". But output row 2 is \"00885555\"??? Wait, let's re-read the output for example 1: They said output row numbers are: \nRow0: \"003300\"\nRow1: \"003300\"\nRow2: \"007777\"\nRow3: \"007777\"\nRow4: \"000000\"\nRow5: \"000000\"\n\nBut wait, my prediction for block row 1 would be \"007777\" for both rows? Let's check: For input row1, first cell is 0 => block \"00\", second cell is 7 => block \"77\", third cell is 7 => block \"77\". So then each row in block row 1 should be \"00\" + \"77\" + \"77\" = \"007777\". And indeed row2 and row3 are \"007777\". Then block row 2: corresponds to input row2: [0, 0, 0]. So block for each cell is \"00\". So row4 and row5 become \"000000\". That fits perfectly.\n\nSo rule seems: Given an input grid, double each cell to form a 2x2 block, where the digit is repeated in the block. So transformation rule: output grid is of dimension (2*input_rows) x (2*input_cols). Each cell in the input grid is replaced by a 2x2 block filled with that digit. But wait, check example 2: Input:\nRow0: \"0080\"\nRow1: \"0855\"\nRow2: \"0005\"\nRow3: \"0000\"\n\nLet's check: For each cell, output is 2x2 block with same digit repeated", "prompt_tokens": 490, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" There are 3 examples given. Each example input and output pair shows some pattern transformation. We must deduce the rule.\n\nWe are provided with three examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n```\n0088000\n8888800\n0880880\n0888800\n0008800\n0000000\n0000000\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0011000\n3311400\n0320440\n0221100\n0001100\n0000000\n0000000\n```\nLet's denote rows 0 through 6. Let's represent grid as 7 rows of 7 columns. But we see each row is 7-digit string? Actually each row is 7 columns? Actually check: \"0088000\" is 7 digits, \"8888800\" is 7 digits, so yes. We'll need coordinate positions. The given examples are each 7x7 grids. But note that in the sample examples, the grid is 7 rows by 7 columns.\n\nLet's analyze Example 1.\n\nI'll denote rows by index:\n\nRow0: \"0088000\"\nRow1: \"8888800\"\nRow2: \"0880880\"\nRow3: \"0888800\"\nRow4: \"0008800\"\nRow5: \"0000000\"\nRow6: \"0000000\"\n\nOutput example1:\nRow0: \"0011000\"\nRow1: \"3311400\"\nRow2: \"0320440\"\nRow3: \"0221100\"\nRow4: \"0001100\"\nRow5: \"0000000\"\nRow6: \"0000000\"\n\nLet's mark digits as coordinates. I'll extract coordinates for positions with non-zero digits.\n\nMapping \"8\" to \"1\"? Possibly transformation: in output, the digits from input \"8\" become \"1\" or maybe become \"3\" sometimes. Let me check: In input row0, \"0088000\". Non-zero digits: positions (0,?) Actually, let's index columns from 0 to 6. Row0: digits: col0: 0, col1: 0, col2: 8, col3: 8, col4: 0, col5: 0, col6: 0. So two 8's at (0,2) and (0,3) become in output row0: \"0011000\": so they become \"1\" at col2 and col3? Actually output row0: \"0011000\" digits: col0: 0, col1: 0, col2: 1, col3: 1, col4: 0, col5: 0, col6: 0. So two 8's become two 1's. But then row1: \"8888800\": positions: col0: 8, col1: 8, col2: 8, col3: 8, col4: 8, col5: 0, col6: 0. Output row1: \"3311400\": digits: col0: 3, col1: 3, col2: 1, col3: 1, col4: 4, col5: 0, col6: 0. So what's transformation? The \"8\" in row1 become: first two 8's become 3's? then next two 8's become 1's? then the last 8 becomes 4? That is suspicious.\n\nMaybe transformation is based on connectivity of 8's? Possibly rule: The transformation takes clusters of connected 8's and then maps them to numbers based on cluster size or position? Let's check row2: \"0880880\": digits: col0: 0, col1: 8, col2: 8, col3: 0, col4: 8, col5: 8, col6: 0.\nOutput row2: \"0320440\": digits: col0: 0, col1:3, col2:2, col3:0, col4:4, col5:4, col6:0.\nWait output row2: \"0320440\" means: first digit: 0, second: 3, third: 2, fourth: 0, fifth: 4, sixth: 4, seventh:0. Compare with input row2: \"0880880\" where non-zero digits are at col1, col2, col4, col5. They got transformed to: at col1: 3, col2: 2, col4: 4, col5: 4. So cluster? Possibly group them by connectivity? Let's check row3: \"0888800\": input row3: positions: col0:0, col1:8, col2:8, col3:8, col4:8, col5:0, col6:0. Output row3: \"0221100\": digits: col0:0, col1:2, col2:2, col3:1, col4:1, col5:0, col6:0. So cluster of four 8's becomes: 2,2,1,1. Row4: \"0008800\": positions: col0:0, col1:0, col2:0, col3:8, col4:8, col5:0, col6:0. Output row4: \"0001100\": digits: col0:0, col1:0, col2:0, col3:1, col4:1, col5:0, col6:0.\n\nSo in example1, input digits \"8\" are transformed differently depending on their location. They are not simply replaced by a constant. They become numbers: sometimes 1, 2, 3, 4. They appear to be mapping to \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\" in various combinations. Possibly these numbers represent directions or connections? Let\u2019s inspect the pattern in each row.\n\nMaybe the transformation is: \"Replace each 8 with a number that indicates the distance from the nearest 0\"? But that doesn't yield these digits.\n\nMaybe it's a counting of number of adjacent 8's? Let's check row1: \"8888800\". The 8's are contiguous block of 5. They become in output: [3, 3, 1, 1, 4]. That sequence is not monotonic. Alternatively maybe they are labeling the order of appearance in a path? Possibly following connected paths of 8's.\n\nI suspect that the transformation might be: \"Trace the connected components of 8's and assign labels based on the order of nodes in the component's minimal spanning tree, starting from some corner, and then fill in the output grid accordingly.\"\n\nLet's try to see if there is a pattern: The output numbers in example 1 are small integers: 1,2,3,4. And the input grid only contains 8's and 0's. Possibly the transformation is: \"Replace each 8 with a number that represents the number of 8's in its connected component modulo something\" but then row1: group of 5 becomes numbers: 3,3,1,1,4. That doesn't match.\n\nMaybe it's: \"For each group of contiguous 8's, label them with consecutive numbers, starting with 1 for the group that has the smallest row index, and then increase within each connected group?\" But then row1's group of 5 should be labeled with 1,2,3,4,5 but instead we see 3,3,1,1,4. So that's not it.\n\nMaybe it's: \"For each cell that originally had an 8, output a digit that is the Manhattan distance from that cell to some specific cell (like the center)?\" Let's check: For row0: (0,2) and (0,3). Manhattan distance from (0,2) to center (3,3) is |0-3|+|2-3|=3+1=4, not 1. Not that.\n\nMaybe it's: \"For each cell, count the number of 8's in its row and column\"? For row0: In row0, there are two 8's. But output is 1,1. For row1: in row1, there are 5 8's. But output digits: 3,3,1,1,4. Possibly each digit corresponds to the number of neighbors (adjacent horizontally?) Let\u2019s check: For row1, consider left-most 8 at (1,0). Neighbors (if we count 8's adjacent orth horizontally maybe?) But then (1,0): adjacent to (1,1) is 8, so count=1. But output is 3. Not that.\n\nMaybe it's: \"For each cell, the output digit equals the number of 8's in its connected region that are adjacent to it in a specific pattern?\" Wait, row1 \"8888800\" becomes \"3311400\". How can we get 3 from left-most 8? Possibly by counting the number of 8's in its column or row that are above it? For (1,0), above it is row0, col0 is 0, so not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's: \"Trace a path through the grid, reading off the", "prompt_tokens": 617, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The problem is ARC with transformation rule. We have three examples and then test input. We need to deduce the transformation rule from provided examples.\n\nLet's check examples:\n\nLet's denote them as \"Example 1\" with input and output pairs.\n\nLet's carefully check provided examples.\n\nI see that input grids in examples are strings of numbers \"50050\" etc. Wait, look at Example 1 Input:\n```\n50050\n50050\n50555\n55500\n00500\n00555\n00050\n55550\n05000\n05000\n05550\n00050\n05555\n55000\n05000\n```\nWait, count lines: Possibly 15 lines? Let me recount: Actually, count lines carefully:\n\nE.g. 1 Input: Actually text is:\n```\n50050\n50050\n50555\n55500\n00500\n00555\n00050\n55550\n05000\n05000\n05550\n00050\n05555\n55000\n05000\n```\nWait, there are 15 lines. But I need to check output as well.\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n```\n50050\n50050\n50555\n55500\n00500\n00555\n00058\n55558\n05888\n05888\n05558\n00058\n05555\n55000\n75000\n```\nObserving that transformation rule might be applied per line? But likely it's a per grid transformation. Actually maybe transformation rule is not per line but a pattern that affects digits in some positions. Let's analyze changes.\n\nFor Example 1, compare input and output line by line:\n\nLine 1: \"50050\" -> \"50050\": no change.\nLine 2: \"50050\" -> \"50050\": no change.\nLine 3: \"50555\" -> \"50555\": no change.\nLine 4: \"55500\" -> \"55500\": no change.\nLine 5: \"00500\" -> \"00500\": no change.\nLine 6: \"00555\" -> \"00555\": no change.\nLine 7: \"00050\" -> \"00058\": changed: originally \"00050\", output \"00058\". Digit changed: last digit changed from 0 to 8.\nLine 8: \"55550\" -> \"55558\": changed: last digit changed from 0 to 8.\nLine 9: \"05000\" -> \"05888\": changed: \"05000\" -> \"05888\". Actually, let's compare: first digit \"0\" remains, second digit \"5\" remains? Wait, let's compare digit by digit:\n\n\"05000\" vs \"05888\": \n- The first digit \"0\" remains \"0\"\n- The second digit \"5\" remains \"5\"\n- Third digit: \"0\" in input becomes \"8\" in output? Actually string: \"05000\" digits: 0,5,0,0,0. \"05888\" digits: 0,5,8,8,8. So digits from index 2 onward changed to 8. But not exactly. Let's check next:\nLine 10: \"05000\" -> \"05888\": same as line 9? Output is same \"05888\"\nLine 11: \"05550\" -> \"05558\": changed: last digit from 0 to 8.\nLine 12: \"00050\" -> \"00058\": changed: last digit from 0 to 8.\nLine 13: \"05555\" -> \"05555\": no change.\nLine 14: \"55000\" -> \"55000\": no change.\nLine 15: \"05000\" -> \"75000\": changed: first digit changed from \"0\" to \"7\"? Actually \"05000\" -> \"75000\": first digit changed from 0 to 7. The rest remain same? Actually \"05000\" digits: 0,5,0,0,0, \"75000\" digits: 7,5,0,0,0.\n\nSo in Example 1, only lines that got modified are line 7,8,9,10,11,12,15. Observing pattern: The modifications are not consistent per line, but maybe they depend on position in grid, like maybe columns? Let's check columns? The input grid is 5 columns, 15 rows. The transformation rule might be something like: change all occurrences of '0' to '8' except under some conditions? Look at line 7: \"00050\" -> \"00058\", so the last digit becomes 8. But then check line 9: \"05000\" -> \"05888\". That means that the third digit changed from 0 to 8, fourth digit from 0 to 8, fifth digit from 0 to 8. Similarly line 15: \"05000\" -> \"75000\", meaning the first digit changed from 0 to 7. So there is pattern for specific digits in specific rows? Let's index rows from top. Wait, maybe the transformation rule is not applied uniformly across rows. Perhaps it's based on the symbol '0' turning into something? But then why some zeros remain 0? Possibly transformation rule operates on connected groups of zeros? Wait, but then look at Example 2:\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\n```\n005005000\n005555000\n555000000\n050000000\n050005555\n055555000\n550005555\n000005000\n555555000\n000005000\n```\nE.g. 2 Output:\n```\n005775888\n005555888\n555888888\n058888888\n058885555\n055555000\n550005555\n000005000\n555555000\n000005000\n```\nSo in Example 2, some rows changed. Let's compare row by row:\n\nRow1: \"005005000\" -> \"005775888\". Let's compare digits:\nInput: 0,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,0. Output: \"0,0,5,7,7,5,8,8,8\". So changes: The digit at position 4 changed from 0 to 7, and digit at position 3? Actually, let's label indices: I'll index columns from 1 to 9.\nRow1:\ncol1: 0 remains 0.\ncol2: 0 remains 0.\ncol3: 5 remains 5.\ncol4: 0 becomes 7.\ncol5: 0 becomes 7.\ncol6: 5 remains 5.\ncol7: 0 becomes 8.\ncol8: 0 becomes 8.\ncol9: 0 becomes 8.\nSo transformation for row1: It seems the middle block \"00\" became \"77\", and the trailing three zeros became \"888\".\n\nRow2: \"005555000\" -> \"005555888\".\nRow2:\ncol1: 0 remains 0.\ncol2: 0 remains 0.\ncol3: 5 remains 5.\ncol4: 5 remains 5.\ncol5: 5 remains 5.\ncol6: 5 remains 5.\ncol7: 0 becomes 8.\ncol8: 0 becomes 8.\ncol9: 0 becomes 8.\nSo row2: transformation: trailing three zeros become 888.\n\nRow3: \"555000000\" -> \"555888888\".\nRow3:\ncol1: 5 remains 5.\ncol2: 5 remains 5.\ncol3: 5 remains 5.\ncol4: 0 becomes 8.\ncol5: 0 becomes 8.\ncol6: 0 becomes 8.\ncol7: 0 becomes 8.\ncol8: 0 becomes 8.\ncol9: 0 becomes 8.\nSo row3: all zeros become 8.\nRow4: \"050000000\" -> \"058888888\".\nRow4:\ncol1: 0 remains 0.\ncol2: 5 remains 5.\ncol3: 0 becomes 8? Actually, check: \"050000000\" digits: 0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. Output \"058888888\": digits: 0,5,8,8,8,8,8,8,8.\nSo row4: after the initial \"05\", the remaining eight zeros become 8.\nRow5: \"050005555\" -> \"058885555\".\nRow5:\ndigits: input: 0,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5.\nOutput: 0,5,8,8,8,5,5,5,5.\nSo row5: after initial \"05\", the next three digits become 8, then \"555\" remains unchanged.\nRow6: \"055555000\" -> \"055555000\". So no change.\nRow7: \"550005555\" -> \"550005555\". No change.\nRow8: \"000005000\" -> \"000005000\". No change.\nRow9: \"555555000\" -> \"555555000\". No change.\nRow10: \"000005000\" -> \"000005000\". No change.\n\nObserving pattern in Example 2: It seems transformation is applied to some rows where there are groups of zeros that are contiguous? But then row1: the middle zeros (col4 and col5) become 7s, not 8s. Row4: after the \"05\" prefix, the zeros become 8. Row5: after the \"05\" prefix, the next three zeros become", "prompt_tokens": 716, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's re-read the provided examples.\n\nWe are given three examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \n\"8280000000\"\n\"1810000000\"\n\"1810000000\"\n\nOutput:\n\"8288888828\"\n\"1811111181\"\n\"1811111181\"\n\nWe observe pattern: In input, some digits are repeated, but what changed? Let's check rows:\n\nRow1: \"8280000000\" -> \"8288888828\"\nRow2: \"1810000000\" -> \"1811111181\"\n\nIn the output, look at the outer digits: \"8\" remains same in outer positions. The middle digits obviously become 8 in row1, row2 become 1 in row2. But let's check carefully: Input row1: \"8280000000\". The first digit is 8, second digit is 2, third digit is 8. Then then zeros fill remainder. Output row1: \"8288888828\". So positions:\npos0: '8' same.\npos1: '2' same.\npos2: '8' same.\nThen pos3 to pos8: originally zeros become \"888888\"? Actually, wait, count: original row1 has 10 digits. The output row1 has 10 digits as well. So the transformation is: every contiguous block of zeros that are between non-zero digits? Let's check: Actually, in example 1, row1: \"8280000000\" becomes \"8288888828\". The first and last digits are same as input: '8' at beginning and '8' at end. But what about the zeros in between? They get replaced by a repeating pattern of \"8\"? But then row2: \"1810000000\" becomes \"1811111181\". The first digit is '1', then second digit '8'? Wait, check row2: \"1810000000\" -> \"1811111181\". In row2, the two outer digits are same: first is 1, last is 1. But the inner digits: \"8\" at position1 are same, but then zeros become \"111111\" and then \"1\" at the end? Wait, let's check: row2 input: \"1810000000\", positions: index0: '1', index1: '8', then indices 2 to 9: zeros. In output row2: \"1811111181\". So index0: '1', index1: '8', then indices 2 to 7: ones \"1111111\", then index8: ? Actually count: \"1811111181\" digits: index0 '1', index1 '8', then 7 digits \"1111111\" and then final digit '1'? But wait, how many characters? Let's count exactly: \"1811111181\" has 10 characters. Let's index positions:\n0: '1'\n1: '8'\n2: '1'\n3: '1'\n4: '1'\n5: '1'\n6: '1'\n7: '1'\n8: '1'\n9: '1'\nBut that doesn't match because then it would be \"1811111111\". But the problem says the output is \"1811111181\". Let's double-check the given sample text.\n\nWait, re-read the provided examples carefully:\n\nGiven text:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n8280000000\n1810000000\n1810000000\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n8288888828\n1811111181\n1811111181\n\nLet's count digits: For row1: \"8280000000\" is given, output: \"8288888828\". Count digits: \"8288888828\" count: 1:8,2:2,3:8,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8,8:8,9:2,10:8? Actually, let me count carefully: \"8288888828\" is 10 characters. Positions: 0: '8'\n1: '2'\n2: '8'\n3: '8'\n4: '8'\n5: '8'\n6: '8'\n7: '8'\n8: '8'\n9: '2'\n10: '8' Wait, that's 11 characters if 0-indexed. Let's check: The string \"8288888828\" how many characters? Let's count: 8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8. That is 10 digits. So indices: 0:8,1:2,2:8,3:8,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:8,8:2,9:8.\nFor row2: \"1810000000\" becomes \"1811111181\". Counting digits: \"1\", \"8\", \"1\", then \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\" that would be 10 digits but the given string \"1811111181\" must be parsed as: digits: 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1. Let's check: The string \"1811111181\": char0='1', char1='8', char2='1', char3='1', char4='1', char5='1', char6='1', char7='1', char8='8', char9='1'. So row2: first digit (1) remains, second digit (8) remains, then the zeros become ones, but then what about the 8 at index8? Possibly the rule is \"fill in the contiguous region between the first and last non-zero digits with a digit that is repeated, but then at the end, the last non-zero digit is repeated at both edges\"? Let's check row3: \"1810000000\" -> \"1811111181\", same as row2.\n\nWait, but then what exactly is the rule? Let's check example 2:\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\n323000000000\n121000000000\n323000000000\n131000000000\n\nE.g. 2 Output:\n323333333323\n121111111121\n323333333323\n131111111131\n\nLet's analyze row by row.\n\nFor row1: Input: \"323000000000\". Count digits: \"323\" then \"000000000\" seems like \"323\" then 9 zeros? Wait, count: \"323\" is 3 digits; then \"000000000\" is 9 zeros? That makes 12 digits total. Output: \"323333333323\". Count digits: \"323\" then \"33333333\" then \"23\"? Let's check: \"323333333323\". Count: 1:3,2:2,3:3, then maybe a sequence of 3's then \"323\" at the end. Let's break it: It might be: prefix \"323\", then fill with 3's until the last two digits are \"23\". But then row2: Input: \"121000000000\" becomes \"121111111121\". So pattern: The first digit remains, then second digit remains, then the rest becomes some repeated digit? But then the last digit repeats the first digit? Let's check row2: original: \"121000000000\". Output: \"121111111121\". So pattern: Keep first digit (1), second digit (2), then fill the middle with a digit? Actually, wait, pattern: row2 output: first two digits \"12\" match input \"12\". Then the zeros become \"11111111\" (8 ones) then final digit \"1\". But note row1: \"323000000000\" becomes \"323333333323\". So pattern: The first three digits remain, then fill the middle with a digit (3) repeated, then the last digit is the same as the first digit? But not exactly: The last digit of row1 output is \"3\", but input row1 first digit is \"3\". And row2 output: last digit is \"1\", same as input row2 first digit which is \"1\" (and also the first digit of row2 is \"1\" and the last digit is \"1\").\n\nLet's check row3: Input: \"323000000000\" becomes \"323333333323\". That fits same pattern. Row4: Input: \"131000000000\" becomes \"131111111131\". So pattern: For each row, the first two digits (or first three digits?) Actually, check row lengths: Row1: \"323000000000\" is 12 digits, row2: \"121000000000\" is 12 digits, row3: \"323000000000\" is 12 digits, row4: \"131000000000\" is 12 digits.\n\nThe output row1: \"323333333323\" is 12 digits. So pattern: It seems the rule is: leave the first and last column as is, and fill the middle columns with a repeating digit that is equal to the digit in the first column? But row1: first column is 3, but the fill digit becomes 3. Row2: first column is 1, but fill digit becomes 1. Row3: first column is 3, fill digit becomes 3. Row4: first column is 1, fill digit becomes 1.\n\nBut then look at Example 1: Input row1: \"8280000000\" -> output \"8288888828\". Check: first digit is 8,", "prompt_tokens": 551, "completion_tokens": 2048}

In the internal rows some digits have been modified. Let's see row by row differences:\n\nRow index: (0-indexed)\nRow 0: identical: \"8888888888888\". \nRow 1: input \"0000000000000\", output \"0080000080000\". So \"0\" changed to \"8\" in columns 1 and 7? Actually, let's check: output row: \"0080000080000\" digits: positions: index 0 = 0, index 1 = 0, index 2 = 8, index 3 = 0, index 4 = 0, index 5 = 0, index 6 = 0? Wait let me re-read carefully:\nWe have string \"0080000080000\". Let's index from 0:\n0: 0\n1: 0\n2: 8\n3: 0\n4: 0\n5: 0\n6: 0\n7: 0? Actually, wait, I need to re-read carefully:\n\"0080000080000\": Actually, I'll count digits: maybe it's 14 digits? Let's count: The first row input is 14 digits \"8888888888888\". So each row has 14 digits. So in row 1 input \"0000000000000\", output \"0080000080000\". Let me split into columns: \"00 8000 0080000\"? Not sure.\n\nLet me count:\n\"0080000080000\" is 14 digits:\nIndex: \n0: '0'\n1: '0'\n2: '8'\n3: '0'\n4: '0'\n5: '0'\n6: '0'\n7: '0'\n8: '8'\n9: '0'\n10: '0'\n11: '0'\n12: '0'\n13: '0'\n\nWait, let me check: maybe I should look at the pattern: It appears that row 1 output has 8's inserted at indices 2 and 8? But then row 2 from input \"0010000010000\" becomes output \"0010800010000\". So difference: the digit at position 3 is '8'? Wait \"0010800010000\" compared to \"0010000010000\": difference is at index 3, '0' becomes '8'. Also row 5 input \"0000000001000\" becomes output \"0000000008000\": So difference: the digit at index 10 (or maybe index 9?) Actually, let's check: \"0000000001000\" vs \"0000000008000\", the difference is the '1' becomes '8'? Wait, check: \"0000000001000\" if we count digits: indices: \"0000000001 0000\" so difference is at index 10 maybe? Let's re-read: \"0000000001000\" vs \"0000000008000\". The only difference is that the '1' has become '8'? But then row 8: input \"0010000000001\" becomes output \"0010000000001\": no change.\n\nRow 9: input \"0000000010000\" becomes output \"0030000010003\": differences: first digit becomes 3, last digit becomes 3, and maybe a digit in the middle changed?\nRow 10: input \"0000000000000\" becomes output \"0000000030000\": so digits changed to '3' in positions? \nRow 11: input \"0000010000000\" becomes output \"0000010000000\"? Actually, check: row 11 input \"0000010000000\" remains same? But output row 11 is \"0000010000000\"? Wait, re-read: Actually, let me re-read the provided output:\nRow 0: \"8888888888888\"\nRow 1: \"0080000080000\"\nRow 2: \"0010800010000\"\nRow 3: \"0000100000000\"\nRow 4: \"0000000008000\"\nRow 5: \"0000000001000\"\nRow 6: \"0000010000000\"\nRow 7: \"0000030000000\"\nRow 8: \"0010000000001\"\nRow 9: \"0030000010003\"\nRow 10: \"0000000030000\"\nRow 11: \"3333333333333\".\n\nI need to check row by row carefully.\n\nI suspect that the transformation involves drawing lines connecting certain digits, maybe connecting non-zero digits? Possibly rule: \"Replace every 1 with adjacent 8's\" but not sure.\n\nLet's try to see pattern: The input grid has 12 rows, 14 columns. The border rows remain: first row and last row remain unchanged (all 8's and 3's respectively). In the middle rows, some are transformed. Possibly the transformation rule is: \"For every occurrence of '1' that is not on the border, replace it with '8' if it is horizontally adjacent to something?\" Not sure.\n\nWait, let's check: In row 1, originally \"0000000000000\", but output \"0080000080000\". So two '8's appear in row 1. Where did they come from? Possibly they come from the fact that row 1 is adjacent to row 0 and row 2? Look at row 2: \"0010000010000\" becomes \"0010800010000\". The difference is only one digit: the digit at index 3 changed from '0' to '8'? But wait, check row2 \"0010000010000\": positions: index0=0, index1=0, index2=1, index3=0, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0, index7=0, index8=1, index9=0, index10=0, index11=0, index12=0, index13=0? Actually, I need to count exactly. Let me re-read example 1 input rows:\nRow0: 8888888888888\nRow1: 0000000000000\nRow2: 0010000010000\nRow3: 0000100000000\nRow4: 0000000000000\nRow5: 0000000001000\nRow6: 0000010000000\nRow7: 0000000000000\nRow8: 0010000000001\nRow9: 0000000010000\nRow10: 0000000000000\nRow11: 3333333333333\n\nOutput rows:\nRow0: 8888888888888\nRow1: 0080000080000\nRow2: 0010800010000\nRow3: 0000100000000\nRow4: 0000000008000\nRow5: 0000000001000\nRow6: 0000010000000\nRow7: 0000030000000\nRow8: 0010000000001\nRow9: 0030000010003\nRow10: 0000000030000\nRow11: 3333333333333\n\nI see some rows remain unchanged: row3, row5, row6 remain same? Actually, row3 unchanged, row5 unchanged, row6 unchanged. Rows with indices 1,2,4,7,9,10 changed.\n\nMaybe transformation rule is: \"For each row, count the number of 1's and replace them with the digit that is the sum of something?\" Possibly rule: \"Replace each 1 with an 8 if it's in the row interior?\" Not sure.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is \"draw a line (or connect the 1's with a line) and then fill the connecting path with 8's, and endpoints with 3's.\" The examples look like puzzles where you connect endpoints.\n\nI recall ARC tasks: They sometimes involve drawing a line between red and blue endpoints. For example, grid with endpoints and path. The input grid might be a line drawing puzzle where you connect endpoints with a line. The output grid shows the path drawn. In ARC, a common transformation is: \"Given a grid with endpoints (colored numbers) and a blank path, draw the path connecting them.\" But here the digits are 0, 1, 8, 3 etc. Possibly the rule: The endpoints (like 8 and 3) remain. The interior ones become path cells (like 8 or", "prompt_tokens": 937, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The instructions say: \"Output final test grid (JSON list of lists, e.g., [[1,0]])\". But E.g. 1 output is \"2\"? That is not a grid, it's a number \"2\". Possibly it is the number of something found in the output grid? Actually, all examples: E.g. 2 output: \"3\", E.g. 3 output: \"8\".\n\nGiven the pattern of the examples: E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3. The output in each is a single number (2, 3, 8) but what does that number represent? It might be the count of something from the transformation. Perhaps the rule is: count the number of \"something\" in the grid after transformation. Possibly the transformation rule is to count the number of \"holes\" or count the number of connected regions or something like that?\n\nWait, but the provided outputs are small numbers. They might be \"the answer is counting how many times some feature appears\". Or maybe they are the result of a transformation that reduces the entire grid to a single number, such as sum of digits mod something or count of specific digits.\n\nLet's analyze E.g. 1 input and output (2). The input grid is a grid of digits. Possibly the rule is: count the number of '8's that are not adjacent to any other digit? But then output is 2. Let's check: In E.g. 1 input, does it have exactly 2 occurrences of some digit? Possibly count of \"8\" is huge because many digits are 8. But output is 2. Alternatively, maybe it's the number of transitions from one digit to another along a diagonal or border? Alternatively, maybe it's the number of distinct connected components of a certain digit? Let\u2019s check connectivity of digits maybe?\n\nMaybe transformation: Count the number of \"holes\" closed by loops in the grid. ARC sometimes have tasks like \"draw a grid and count holes\" or \"find the number of enclosed areas\" etc. But the outputs are 2, 3, 8. They are not huge compared to grid sizes.\n\nMaybe we can re-read examples carefully:\n\nE.g. 1 Input is a grid of digits, where each row is a string of digits. Possibly the rule is: count the number of \"1\"s? But then output \"2\" means there are 2 ones? Let's count ones in e.g. 1 input. Let\u2019s see first row: \"088838008108038018088008\". Count ones? There's \"108\" in the middle: there is \"1\" at position maybe \"1\" then \"0\" then \"8\"? Let's check: \"088838008108038018088008\". Actually, scanning: digits: 0,0,8,8,3,8,0,0,8,1,0,8,0,3,8,0,1,8,0,8,8,0,0,8. Count ones: There's one \"1\" at index 9 and one \"1\" at index 15? Check: digits: indices: 0:0,1:0,2:8,3:8,4:3,5:8,6:0,7:0,8:8,9:1,10:0,11:8,12:0,13:3,14:8,15:0,16:1,17:8,18:0,19:8,20:8,21:0,22:0,23:8. So indeed there are two ones. But then e.g. 1 output is \"2\". That might be a coincidence. Let's check e.g. 2 input: \"0302202202020022020800\" etc. Count ones? Possibly count ones in e.g. 2 input? Let's check row1: \"0302202202020022020800\". Does that have any \"1\"? It does not appear. Count ones in whole e.g. 2 input? Possibly \"1\" appears in row? I see digits: 0,3,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0,8,0,0. So no ones. But output is \"3\". So not count of ones.\n\nMaybe rule: count the number of distinct digits? For e.g. 1 input, distinct digits: 0,8,3,1. That is 4 distinct digits, but output is 2. For e.g. 2 input: distinct digits: 0,3,2, ? Actually, let\u2019s check e.g. 2 input: Row 1: digits: 0,3,0,2,2,... distinct: {0,2,3} maybe. That is 3 distinct digits. And output is \"3\". For e.g. 3 input: distinct digits from row 1: \"0055550505050055050550\". The digits: 0 and 5. So distinct count = 2, but output is \"8\". So not distinct digit count.\n\nMaybe rule: count the number of \"holes\" in the grid? For example, in e.g. 1 input, if we count loops in digits that have holes? Some digits have holes: 0,4,6,8,9 typically. But here digits are 0,1,2,3,8... Actually, typical hole counts: 0 has 1 hole, 4 has 1 hole sometimes, 6 has 1 hole, 8 has 2 holes, 9 has 1 hole. But e.g. 1 input might have many holes. But the output is a single digit \"2\". That might be the total number of holes modulo something? Let\u2019s try: Count holes in e.g. 1 input maybe? Let's count holes for each digit: For digit 0: hole count = 1, for 1: 0, for 2: 0, for 3: 0, for 8: 2, for 9: 1 maybe. But then sum holes would be huge. But maybe they count only closed loops on boundaries of contiguous regions? Maybe it's not that.\n\nMaybe transformation is: count the number of \"diagonally adjacent pairs\" or count the number of \"corners\" that are different? Alternatively, maybe it's a puzzle where the transformation rule is \"count the number of 1's in the grid\" but e.g. 2 didn't contain any 1's.\n\nMaybe the rule is: count the number of \"2's\" in the grid? For e.g. 1: count \"2\"s? Let's check e.g. 1: There's no \"2\"? Actually, e.g. 1 input: digits: appear digits: 0,8,3,1. There is no 2. So that doesn't work.\n\nMaybe rule: count the number of \"2\" digits in the grid after reading the grid as a matrix? For e.g. 2: there are many 2's. But output is 3 though, which is too small.\n\nMaybe rule: count the number of transitions along a specific edge? For e.g. 1 input, maybe count the number of \"holes\" or count the number of \"islands\" of a certain digit? For e.g. 2 input, maybe count islands of \"2\" digits? Possibly the rule is: \"Count the number of connected groups of a particular color/digit, specifically the digit that is not present in the other examples.\" In e.g.", "prompt_tokens": 1282, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Not exactly, though let's check. Actually, check the positions: It looks like the digits \"8\" and \"0\" are shifted by some pattern. Wait, let's analyze the differences between input and output.\n\nLet's denote coordinates as (row, column) with row index starting from 0. Let's check positions.\n\nFor example 1, row 0 input: \"0000000000\".\nOutput row 0: \"0000000000\". So row 0 remains same.\n\nRow 1 input: \"0888000000\". Output row 1: \"0000888000\". So the \"0888\" digits are shifted left by 3 positions: originally \"0888\" at positions columns 1-4? Actually, check: \"0888000000\" means 0 at index0 then \"888\" then \"000\". But after transformation, they appear as \"000\" then \"888\" then \"000\"? Wait, re-check: \"0888\" vs \"0888\"? Let's compute: Input row 1: index: 0:0, 1:0, 2:8, 3:8, 4:8, 5:0, 6:0, 7:0, 8:0,9:0. Output row 1: \"0000888000\" means index:0:0,1:0,2:0, then \"888\" at indices 3,4,5, then \"000\" at 6,7,8, and 0 index9? Actually careful: \"0000888000\" is 10 digits: positions: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:8,5:8,6:8,7:0,8:0,9:0. So the block \"888\" originally at indices 2-4 is moved to indices 3-5? Actually, check: original row 1: indices: 2:8, 3:8, 4:8. In output, indices: 4:8,5:8,6:8. So they are shifted right by one. And then what about the initial zeros? In input row 1, there are two zeros at index0-1; in output, there are three zeros at index0-2. Similarly row 2 input: \"0808000000\". Output: \"0000808000\". So the block \"0808\" might be shifted? Let's check: original row 2: digits: index0:0, index1:8, index2:0, index3:8, index4:0, index5:0,... but output row2: \"0000808000\" means index0:0, index1:0, index2:0, then \"808\" at index3-5? Let's check: output row2: \"0000808000\" has digits: index0:0, index1:0, index2:0, index3:0, index4:8, index5:0, index6:8, index7:0, index8:0, index9:0. Actually, check: \"0000808000\" visually: \"0000\" then \"808\" then \"000\" but wait, count digits: \"000000\" would be 6 digits, but we need 10 digits. Let's break properly:\n\nOutput row 2: \"0000808000\" (10 digits). Let's index each:\nindex0: 0\nindex1: 0\nindex2: 0\nindex3: 0\nindex4: 8\nindex5: 0\nindex6: 8\nindex7: 0\nindex8: 0\nindex9: 0\n\nOriginal row2: \"0808000000\" digits:\nindex0: 0\nindex1: 8\nindex2: 0\nindex3: 8\nindex4: 0\nindex5: 0\nindex6: 0\nindex7: 0\nindex8: 0\nindex9: 0\n\nSo transformation: the original digits at indices 1,3,? Actually, mapping: Output row2, index3:0, index4:8, index5:0, index6:8, index7:0 correspond maybe to original row2, index1, index3, index? Let's check: original row2: positions: index1=8, index3=8, index? Wait, let me try to align: In row1, the transformation appears to be: The block of 3 non-zero digits (or pattern?) is shifted right by one, and extra zeros are prepended. Row1: \"0888000000\" becomes \"0000888000\". Observing that the block \"888\" from indices (2,3,4) gets moved to (3,4,5) and then the initial zeros become one extra zero in front? But row1 originally had \"00\" at beginning. In output we have \"000\". So the number of zeros increased by one. Similarly, row2: \"0808000000\" becomes \"0000808000\". Let's check mapping: In row2, the non-zero digits are at indices: 1:8, 3:8, 4:0 is not non-zero. Wait, row2 is \"0808000000\": digits: index0:0, index1:8, index2:0, index3:8, index4:0, then rest zeros. In output row2, digits: index0:0, index1:0, index2:0, index3:0, index4:8, index5:0, index6:8, then zeros. So it seems the pattern is: for each row, the digits that are not 0 are shifted one column to the right relative to their original positions, and then one extra zero is inserted at the beginning. But wait, check row1: The non-zero digits in row1: indices 2,3,4 (all 8's). In output, they appear at indices 4,5,6, which is exactly one column to the right of 3,4,5. But wait, originally they were at indices 2,3,4, and output they are at indices 4,5,6, so they've been shifted right by 2? Let's recalc: original row1: digits: \"0 0 8 8 8 0 ...\". Output row1: \"0 0 0 8 8 8 0 ...\" so the block moved from starting at index2 to starting at index? Actually, let me align properly:\n\nOriginal row1: digits:\ncol0:0, col1:0, col2:8, col3:8, col4:8, col5:0, col6:0, col7:0, col8:0, col9:0.\nOutput row1: digits:\ncol0:0, col1:0, col2:0, col3:8, col4:8, col5:8, col6:0, col7:0, col8:0, col9:0.\n\nSo the segment \"888\" moved from col2-4 to col3-5. That is a shift right by 1 column.\n\nNow row2: \"0808000000\": digits: index0:0, index1:8, index2:0, index3:8, index4:0, index5:0, index6:0, index7:0, index8:0, index9:0.\nOutput row2: \"0000808000\": digits: index0:0, index1:0, index2:0, index3:0, index4:8, index5:0, index6:8, index7:0, index8:0, index9:0.\nMapping: In output, the non-zero digits appear at indices 4 and 6, which correspond to original digits at indices 1 and 3, but then they are shifted right by 3? Let's check: For the first non-zero: originally at index1 becomes index4, shift of +3. For second non-zero: originally at index3 becomes index6, shift of +3. That is interesting: not consistent with row1, which had shift of +1. Let's check row3: Input row3: \"0888000000\". Output row3: \"0000888000\". That is similar to row1, so shift of +1.\n\nRow4: Input row4: \"0000000000\" becomes \"0000000000\", no change.\nRow5: Input row5: \"0000000000\"", "prompt_tokens": 731, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The grid is four rows, each row is a string like \"0000\", \"0340\", etc. We want to deduce transformation rule from e.g. example 1 input and output, and e.g. example 2 input and output, then apply it to test input grid.\n\nLet's examine example 1:\n\nExample 1 Input:\nRow0: \"0000\"\nRow1: \"0340\"\nRow2: \"0760\"\nRow3: \"0000\"\n\nExample 1 Output:\nRow0: \"3004\"\nRow1: \"0000\"\nRow2: \"0000\"\nRow3: \"7006\"\n\nI need to see transformation differences:\n\nCoordinates: grid is 4x4? Actually they are strings \"0000\", \"0340\", \"0760\", \"0000\". The transformation output is \"3004\", \"0000\", \"0000\", \"7006\". So how do we get that transformation? Observing the transformation: The output grid has digits rearranged relative to input? Perhaps the transformation rule is to reflect the input grid along a diagonal or something?\n\nLet's compare positions. For example, Example 1 input:\nRow indices: 0,1,2,3; columns 0,1,2,3.\nCoordinates: (row, col)\n\nThe non-zero digits in input: In row1, there's \"0340\":\n cells: (1,0): '0', (1,1): '3', (1,2): '4', (1,3): '0'\n In row2, \"0760\": (2,0): '0', (2,1): '7', (2,2): '6', (2,3): '0'\n\nSo there are two nonzero cells: (1,1) = 3, (1,2) = 4, (2,1)=7, (2,2)=6.\n\nNow in output, non-zero digits: row0: \"3004\" -> nonzero: (0,0)=3, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=4, but then row3: \"7006\" -> (3,0)=7, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=6? Wait check: row0 \"3004\": digits: (0,0)=3, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=4; row3 \"7006\": digits: (3,0)=7, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=6.\n So transformation: The digit '3' originally at (1,1) goes to (0,0) in output. The digit '4' originally at (1,2) goes to (0,3). The digit '7' originally at (2,1) goes to (3,0). The digit '6' originally at (2,2) goes to (3,3).\n\nCheck second example:\nExample 2 Input:\nRow0: \"0000\"\nRow1: \"0560\"\nRow2: \"0830\"\nRow3: \"0000\"\nNonzero cells: row1: (1,1) = '5'? Actually row1 \"0560\": digits: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=5, (1,2)=6, (1,3)=0. And row2: \"0830\": (2,0)=0, (2,1)=8, (2,2)=3, (2,3)=0.\nOutput for example 2:\nRow0: \"5006\"\nRow1: \"0000\"\nRow2: \"0000\"\nRow3: \"8003\"\n\nMapping: In output row0: \"5006\": digits: (0,0)=5, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=0, (0,3)=6.\nRow3: \"8003\": digits: (3,0)=8, (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=3.\nMapping: (1,1)=5 becomes (0,0)=5, (1,2)=6 becomes (0,3)=6, (2,1)=8 becomes (3,0)=8, (2,2)=3 becomes (3,3)=3.\n\nSo rule: It looks like the transformation takes the input grid, and then extracts the nonzero digits from within the \"middle\" 2x2 block? Wait let's check: Actually in both examples, the input grid has nonzero digits only in the central 2x2 submatrix (rows 1-2, columns 1-2). In example 1, the submatrix is:\nRow1: 3 4\nRow2: 7 6\nOutput: But then output grid has these digits placed in positions: top-left becomes bottom-left? Actually, check mapping carefully:\n\nMapping: In both examples, the four digits from the submatrix are repositioned in the output grid, but not in the same order as the input.\n\nMapping in example 1:\nInput submatrix: \n[3, 4]\n[7, 6]\nOutput digits placement: They appear in output at row0, col0 is 3; row0, col3 is 4; row3, col0 is 7; row3, col3 is 6.\nSo mapping: top-left element (3) goes to top-left corner of output? But then top-right element (4) goes to top-right corner of output? bottom-left element (7) goes to bottom-left corner of output? bottom-right element (6) goes to bottom-right corner of output? That is exactly what happened in example 2 as well.\n\nLet's verify: Example 2 submatrix:\n[5, 6]\n[8, 3]\nMapping: (1,1)=5 goes to (0,0); (1,2)=6 goes to (0,3); (2,1)=8 goes to (3,0); (2,2)=3 goes to (3,3). Yes.\n\nSo rule seems to be: Given a grid with a non-zero 2x2 block usually in the center (rows 1-2, columns 1-2) with values, then the transformation maps:\n- The top-left element of that submatrix becomes the top-left element of the output grid.\n- The top-right element of that submatrix becomes the top-right element of the output grid.\n- The bottom-left element of that submatrix becomes the bottom-left element of the output grid.\n- The bottom-right element of that submatrix becomes the bottom-right element of the output grid.\n\nAnd the rest of the grid becomes zeros. But wait, check: In output grid, the other positions that are not corners of the overall grid are zeros. But then note: In example 1, the output grid has zeros everywhere except corners. But corners? Wait, in output grid, we see corners: (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3) are filled with digits, while everything else is zero.\n\nThus, rule: Extract the 2x2 block from input, then place its top-left element at output position (0,0), top-right element at output position (0,3), bottom-left element at output position (3,0), bottom-right element at output (3,3). The other positions remain zero.\n\nBut is that always the rule? Let's re-read the tasks: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" The examples are E.g.1 and E.g.2. They don't necessarily mention \"2x2 block\" explicitly, but it's consistent.\n\nDouble-check: In example 1, input row indices: row1 and row2 are non-zero rows. The digits in these rows at columns 1 and 2 are used. And in output, they appear in corners.\n\nIt might also be possible that the rule is \"mirror along the anti-diagonal\" or \"rotate the 2x2 submatrix by 180 degrees?\" But wait, check: In example 1, if we rotate the submatrix 180 degrees, then top-left becomes bottom-right, top-right becomes bottom-left, bottom-left becomes top-right, bottom-right becomes top-left. That would yield mapping: 3 becomes bottom-right (but output bottom-right is 6), so that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, if we reflect the submatrix along the main diagonal, then top-left stays top-left, top-right becomes bottom-left, bottom-left becomes top-right, bottom-right stays bottom-right. That would yield: (1,1)=3 becomes (0,0)=3, (1,2)=4 becomes (2,0)=? That would put 4 in row2 col0, but in output row2 col0 is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: read the four digits in the center 2x2 block in reading order, and then place them in the corners of the grid in the same order: first digit goes to top-left, second digit goes to top-right, third digit goes to bottom-left, fourth digit goes to bottom-right. That is exactly what we see.\n\nDouble-check: For example 2: reading order: row1: (1,1)=5 then (1,2)=6, then row2: (2,1)=8 then (2,2)=3. Then assign: (0,", "prompt_tokens": 467, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's analyze each example carefully. They are given as strings of digits. Likely it's some \"mirroring\", \"rotation\", \"line reflection\", or \"substitution\" of digits. Possibly it's about counting occurrences of digits, or maybe reading numbers column-wise or row-wise.\n\nObservations: In the examples, the output grid contains only digits 0, 5, and sometimes 0 and 5. Let's check each output grid:\n\nE.g. 1 Output: \nRows:\nRow1: \"0000000\"\nRow2: \"0555505\"\nRow3: \"0500005\"\nRow4: \"5550000\"\n\nWe see digits 0 and 5. In e.g. 2 output, we see \"0005000\", \"0000050\", \"5500000\", \"5500000\". e.g. 3 output: \"0000005\", \"0000000\", \"0000050\", \"0005550\". e.g. 4 output: \"0005050\", \"0505005\", \"5005000\", \"5000000\".\n\nSo outputs are always 4 rows of 7 columns. And inputs are always 4 rows of 14 columns? Let's check input lengths:\nE.g. 1 input: \"00333332220000\" is 14 characters, repeated for 4 rows, so grid 4x14. E.g. 2 input: similarly 4 rows of 14 characters. E.g. 3 input: 4 rows of 14 characters. E.g. 4 input: 4 rows of 14 characters. And test input: 4 rows of 14 characters also.\n\nSo transformation goes from a 4x14 grid to a 4x7 grid. So it appears that transformation is a \"shrinking\" transformation. Possibly each cell in the output corresponds to a pair of columns in the input. Likely rule: For each row, take pairs of adjacent columns from the input grid and produce an output digit that is computed by some rule on the pair. But then, what rule?\n\nExamine e.g. 1: Input row1: \"00333332220000\". Partition into pairs: \"00\", \"33\", \"33\", \"32\", \"22\", \"00\", \"00\"? Wait, let's see: The output row1 has 7 cells. So, how many pairs? If we take 14 columns and pair them, we get 7 pairs. So each output cell corresponds to a pair of input digits. And the output in e.g. 1 row1 is \"0000000\". So each pair in row1? Let's check: row1 pairs: (0,0), (3,3), (3,3), (3,2), (2,2), (0,0), (0,0). And output digits are 0 for each pair. So maybe rule: if the pair is \"00\", then output 0; if pair is \"33\" then output something? But row1 output is 0 for all pairs, but row1 input had pairs \"00\", \"33\", \"33\", \"32\", \"22\", \"00\", \"00\", and output is all 0. So maybe rule is not simply checking if pair equals \"00\". Let's check row2: e.g. 1 row2: \"30000302000000\". Partition into pairs: \"30\", \"00\", \"00\", \"30\", \"20\", \"00\", \"00\". Output row2: \"0555505\". So mapping pairs to digits: \"30\" -> 0? Actually output row2: first digit is 0, second is 5, third is 5, fourth is 5, fifth is 5? Wait, let's re-read row2 output e.g. 1: \"0555505\". So the digits in row2 output: index positions: col1: 0, col2: 5, col3: 5, col4: 5, col5: 5, col6: 0, col7: 5.\nMapping pairs: \nPair1: \"30\" -> output 0\nPair2: \"00\" -> output 5\nPair3: \"00\" -> output 5\nPair4: \"30\" -> output 5? But wait, pair4 \"30\" from row2: index: row2: \"30000302000000\", groups: \ncol1-2: \"30\"\ncol3-4: \"00\"\ncol5-6: \"00\"\ncol7-8: \"30\"\ncol9-10: \"20\"\ncol11-12: \"00\"\ncol13-14: \"00\"\nSo mapping: \"30\" -> 0, \"00\" -> ? then \"00\" -> ? then \"30\" -> ? then \"20\" -> ? then \"00\" -> ? then \"00\" -> ?\n\nWe see output row2: 0,5,5,5,5,0,5. So mapping: \"30\" maps to 0 in first pair, then \"00\" in second and third pair gives 5, then \"30\" in fourth pair gives 5, then \"20\" in fifth pair gives 5, then \"00\" in sixth pair gives 0, then \"00\" in seventh pair gives 5. So maybe rule: if the left cell is 3 then output 0? But then row2: \"30\" pairs exist in positions 1 and 4. They are \"30\" but one maps to 0 and one maps to 5. Let me check row3 e.g. 1: row3 input: \"30033000022220\". Partition into pairs:\nPair1: \"30\"\nPair2: \"03\"\nPair3: \"30\"\nPair4: \"00\"\nPair5: \"00\"\nPair6: \"22\"\nPair7: \"20\"\nOutput row3: \"0500005\". So mapping: \"30\" -> 0? But wait, row3: first pair \"30\" gives output 0, second pair \"03\" gives output 5, third pair \"30\" gives output 0, fourth pair \"00\" gives 0, fifth pair \"00\" gives 0, sixth pair \"22\" gives 0, seventh pair \"20\" gives 5. So pattern: sometimes \"30\" gives 0, sometimes \"30\" gives 5. So the mapping is not consistent by pair content.\n\nMaybe the transformation is column-wise? Alternatively, maybe each output cell is computed by summing corresponding pairs of digits from the input grid across rows? But the output grid dimensions are 4x7, same as input rows count and half the columns count. So each output cell corresponds to a pair of columns from the input. So it's a \"shrink horizontally by factor of 2\". But then what rule is applied on the two digits? Possibly sum of digits mod something? Let's check: For row1 e.g. 1: pairs: \"00\" gives sum 0, \"33\" gives sum 6, \"33\" gives sum 6, \"32\" gives sum 5, \"22\" gives sum 4, \"00\" gives sum 0, \"00\" gives sum 0. But output row1 is \"0000000\". So not sum.\n\nMaybe product? \"00\" product 0, \"33\" product 9, no.\n\nMaybe difference? \"00\" difference 0, \"33\" difference 0, \"33\" difference 0, \"32\" difference -1, \"22\" difference 0, \"00\" difference 0, \"00\" difference 0. Not matching.\n\nMaybe rule: count the number of 3's in the pair? For row1: \"00\" has 0 3's -> output 0, \"33\" has 2 3's, but output is 0, so that doesn't match.\n\nMaybe rule: check if the pair is \"33\", then output 0? But then row3: \"30\" appears sometimes.\n\nWait, maybe the rule involves vertical neighbors. Perhaps the transformation goes column by column. Let's try to reinterpret the examples: The input grid is 14 columns wide, but the output grid is 7 columns wide. Possibly each output cell is computed from a 2x2 block in the", "prompt_tokens": 619, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check each example.\n\nLooking at E.g. 1:\nInput grid, with rows:\nRow1: \"00000000000000000\"\nRow2: \"00200000000000000\"\nRow3: \"02220000000000800\"\nRow4: \"00200000000008880\"\nRow5: \"00000000000000800\"\nRow6: \"00000300000000000\"\nRow7: \"00003330000000000\"\nRow8: \"00000300000000000\"\nRow9: \"00000000000000000\"\nRow10: \"00000000000000000\"\nRow11: \"00000000000000000\"\nRow12: \"00000000000000000\"\nRow13: \"00000000000000000\"\n\nOutput grid:\nRow1: \"020030080\"\nRow2: \"222333888\"\nRow3: \"020030080\"\n\nObserving the pattern, it might be that the output grid is essentially extracted from the input grid's \"diagonals\" or something.\n\nI see that output row1: \"020030080\" has pattern: \nIt seems to be symmetric? There is a center \"3\" in the output row2, so maybe the transformation is to take a \"diagonal\" from the input's patterned digits. Perhaps the transformation is to extract a diamond shape from the input grid.\n\nLet\u2019s see: In E.g. 1, input has nonzero digits in some positions. Nonzero digits in input: They are \"2\", \"2\", \"8\", \"0\", then in row2, col2 is \"2\"? Let's re-read rows carefully:\n\nI rewrite input rows with row index starting from 0 maybe:\n\nRow0: \"00000000000000000\"\nRow1: \"00200000000000000\"\nRow2: \"02220000000000800\"\nRow3: \"00200000000008880\"\nRow4: \"00000000000000800\"\nRow5: \"00000300000000000\"\nRow6: \"00003330000000000\"\nRow7: \"00000300000000000\"\nRow8: \"00000000000000000\"\nRow9: \"00000000000000000\"\nRow10:\"00000000000000000\"\nRow11:\"00000000000000000\"\nRow12:\"00000000000000000\"\n\nObserving nonzero digits:\nRow1: col0: '0'? Actually, row1 is \"00200000000000000\". Actually, wait, let me re-read carefully:\nRow0: all 0.\nRow1: \"00200000000000000\" => There is '2' at col1? Let's index columns from 0:\nRow1: index0:0, index1:0, index2:2, then zeros.\nRow2: \"02220000000000800\" => characters: col0:0, col1:0, col2:2, col3:2, col4:2, col5:0, ... then later \"800\" at end? Actually, let's count: \"02220000000000800\" \nBreak it: \"00\" then \"222\" then \"00000000\" then \"00800\"? I'm not sure.\nBetter: Count length: 17. Let's index columns 0...16.\nRow1: \"00200000000000000\": indices: 0:0,1:0,2:2,3:0,4:0,... I see pattern: There is a \"2\" at col2.\nRow2: \"02220000000000800\": indices: 0:0,1:0,2:2,3:2,4:2,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:8,15:0,16:0? Actually, wait, \"00800\" at end? Let's count: \"02220000000000800\" length=17. Splitting: \"00\" (cols0-1), \"222\" (cols2-4), then \"00000000\" (cols5-12), then \"00800\" (cols13-17) but that substring is \"00800\" which is 5 characters? That would sum to 2+3+8+5=18, too many. Let's count properly: \"02220000000000800\" count digits: \nDigit count: \n0: first char, \n1: second char,\n2: third char,\n3: fourth char,\n4: fifth char,\n5: sixth char,\n6: seventh char,\n7: eighth char,\n8: ninth char,\n9: tenth char,\n10: eleventh char,\n11: twelfth char,\n12: thirteenth,\n13: fourteenth,\n14: fifteenth,\n15: sixteenth,\n16: seventeenth.\nSo length=17. I want to get specific indices where nonzero digits appear:\nRow1: \"00200000000000000\": nonzero is at col2 = '2'.\nRow2: \"02220000000000800\": nonzero digits: col2: '2', col3: '2', col4: '2', then maybe later: col? There's \"00800\" at the end might mean col? Actually, let me try to split: \nMaybe it's easier: The output row2 is \"222333888\". Perhaps the transformation is to take a certain diagonal extraction from the input grid. Notice output row2 \"222333888\" has segments \"222\", then \"333\", then \"888\". And row1 and row3 of output are \"020030080\". They are symmetric in a way.\n\nMaybe transformation rule: It might be \"take the main diagonal from the input\" but then, how do we get three rows output from 13 rows input? Possibly by summing something? \n\nMaybe the transformation is related to \"drawing a line\" or \"connecting dots\" in the input grid. The provided ARC tasks sometimes involve connecting dots or drawing lines and then extracting the result along a diagonal or reading order.\n\nI recall ARC tasks: They often involve \"drawing a line\" from the boundary of the grid. For example, one ARC task is \"connect the dots\" where you draw lines from the positions of nonzero digits and then extract the intersection with the border or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: \"Take the border of the input, and then extract a smaller grid that is a", "prompt_tokens": 792, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We are given provided input/output pairs and then test input. The grid sizes: The examples are apparently 16x16 grids (the given examples are 16-digit strings lines, so each line is a row, 16 columns). The output grids are 4x4 grids? Wait check: The provided E.g. 1 input is 16 lines of 16 digits each? Actually each line is 16 digits: \"9919966446699199\" is 16 digits, and then output is \"2262\" in the first row? There are 4 rows in output grid, each row is 4 digits. So the transformation seems to be to reduce a 16x16 grid to a 4x4 grid. And the transformation rule likely is extraction of a pattern. We are given several examples. Let's check examples.\n\nI see that each input is 16 rows of 16 digits? Actually check E.g. 1: There are exactly 16 rows in the given input. But the output in E.g. 1 is 4 rows of 4 digits each. So transformation is a kind of \"shrinking\" by a factor of 4 in both dimensions. Possibly each group of 4 rows becomes one row in output, and each group of 4 columns becomes one digit. Alternatively, maybe the rule is \"find corners\" or \"find boundaries\"? Let's analyze the numbers.\n\nWe need to see pattern: In E.g. 1, input and output: I'll re-read E.g. 1:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nRow0: 9919966446699199\nRow1: 9922662222662299\nRow2: 1217626666267121\nRow3: 9271426333341729\nRow4: 9664866333384669\nRow5: 6622686333362266\nRow6: 6266668333366626\nRow7: 4262828668282624\nRow8: 4262828668282624\nRow9: 6266668888666626\nRow10: 6622686226862266\nRow11: 9664866886684669\nRow12: 9271426226241729\nRow13: 1217626666267121\nRow14: 9922662222662299\nRow15: 9919966446699199\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nRow0: 2262\nRow1: 8866\nRow2: 2268\nRow3: 8886\n\nSo the output grid is 4x4, each cell is a digit. How to get these digits? Let's try to see pattern.\n\nMaybe it's like picking the \"middle\" or \"symmetric\" positions of the input grid? Possibly taking the center 4 cells of the 16x16? But center of 16x16 grid would be ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe we are summing or subtracting rows? Alternatively, maybe each output digit is computed from a corresponding 4x4 block of the input grid. Since the input is 16 rows and 16 columns, and output is 4 rows and 4 columns, we might partition the input grid into 4x4 blocks. There are 16/4 = 4 blocks per dimension, so total 16 blocks. And each block is 4x4. And then each output digit might be the \"average\" or \"median\" or something of the block values? But the digits in output are 2, 2, 6, 2 in first row. Which block corresponds?\n\nLet's see structure: Partition the 16x16 grid into 4 groups of 4 rows each. That gives 4 blocks vertically. And partition columns into groups of 4 columns. Then each block is 4x4. For E.g. 1, block (0,0) is rows 0-3 and columns 0-3. Let's extract that block from E.g. 1 input:\n\nBlock (0,0) rows 0-3, columns 0-3:\nRow0: digits positions 0-3: \"9919\"?? Wait, row0: \"9919966446699199\", columns 0-3 are \"9919\". But output for block (0,0) digit is? But output row0 col0 is \"2\". But maybe not directly equal.\n\nMaybe transformation is not averaging numeric values? The digits in these blocks are not averaged because average of 9,9,1,9 is 28/4=7, but output digit is 2. Alternatively, maybe transformation is taking some function of the count of a certain digit in the block. Let's see: block (0,0) \"9919\" contains digits: 9,9,1,9. Count of 9's? That equals 3. Count of 1's equals 1. But output digit is 2. Possibly output digit equals the count of 1's? But then block (0,0) count of 1's equals 1, not 2. Alternatively, maybe it's count of 6's? Check block (0,0): digits: 9,9,1,9, no 6's. Alternatively, maybe it's count of outer border digits? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the transformation might be about \"selecting the corners\" from each 4x4 block. For each 4x4 block, maybe the output digit is the sum or difference of the four corner digits, mod something? Let's check block (0,0) corners: top-left=first element of block= row0 col0: that is 9, top-right= row0 col3: 9, bottom-left= row3 col0: row3 is \"9271426333341729\", col0=9, bottom-right= row3 col3: last digit in that row: row3 \"9271426333341729\", col3=9. Sum=9+9+9+9=36, maybe then average=9, not 2.\n\nMaybe it's the count of transitions? Alternatively, maybe transformation is \"rotate and extract the center 4 numbers from each quadrant\"? Alternatively, maybe we are supposed to take the \"diagonals\" of 4x4 blocks. Let's check: Perhaps each output cell corresponds to the sum of the digits on one of the diagonals (like NW-SE) or something mod 10. For block (0,0): NW-SE diagonal: positions (0,0)=9, (1,1)=? Let's extract block (0,0) properly:\n\nBlock (0,0): rows 0-3, columns 0-3.\nRow0: \"9919\" because row0 = \"9919966446699199\", columns 0-3: \"9919\"\nRow1: row1 = \"9922662222662299\", columns 0-3: \"9922\"\nRow2: row2 = \"1217626666267121\", columns 0-3: \"1217\"? Wait, careful: row2 \"1217626666267121\", columns 0-3: positions:\ncol0: '1'\ncol1: '2'\ncol2: '1'\ncol3: '7' (since the digits are \"1217\" at beginning).\nRow3: row3 = \"9271426333341729\", columns 0-3: \"9271\"? Let's check: row3: \"9271426333341729\", first four digits: 9,2,7,1 = \"9271\".\n\nSo block (0,0) is:\n[9,9,1,9]\n[9,9,2,2]\n[1,2,1,7]\n[9,2,7,1]\n\nNow, what could yield output digit 2? Perhaps the output digit is the sum of the four corners mod something? Let's compute sum of corners: top-left=9, top-right=9, bottom-left=9, bottom-right=1; sum=28, mod something? 28 mod 10=8, not 2.\n\nMaybe product of corners? 9*9*9*1=729, last digit 9. Not 2.\n\nMaybe difference between diagonals: difference between NW-SE diagonal sum and NE-SW diagonal sum. NW-SE: 9+2+1+1 = 13, NE-SW: 9+2+2+9 = 22, difference=9? Not 2.\n\nMaybe it's the count of odd numbers in the block? Count odds: in block (0,0), digits: row0: 9 (odd), 9 (odd), 1 (odd), 9 (odd) => 4 odds; row1: 9,9,2,2 => 2 odds; row2: 1,2,1,7 => 3 odds; row3: 9,2,7,1 => 3 odds; total odds=12. 12 mod something? Not 2.\n\nMaybe it's the sum of the digits mod something? Sum of block (0,0) digits: row0: 9+9+1+9=28; row1: 9+9+2+2=22; row2: 1+2+1+7=11; row3: 9+2+7+1=19; total=28+22+11+19=80. 80 mod something? 80 mod 10=0, not 2.\n\nMaybe it's the count of a particular digit, like", "prompt_tokens": 905, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We need to analyze each example to deduce the transformation rule.\n\nLet's analyze examples:\n\nWe have provided examples:\nExample 1:\nInput:\n000000\n022000\n000033\n000033\n000000\n101001\n111111\n\nOutput:\n000000\n000000\n000000\n000000\n020330\n121331\n111111\n\nObserving differences: The transformation rule seems to be modifying the grid's inner parts. In example 1, the input grid is 7 rows x 6 columns (each row is 6 columns?) Actually count columns: each line: \"000000\" is 6 columns, \"022000\" is 6 columns, \"000033\" is 6 columns, \"000033\" is 6 columns, \"000000\" is 6 columns, \"101001\" is 6 columns, \"111111\" is 6 columns.\n\nNow output: \"000000\" row 1, \"000000\" row 2, \"000000\" row 3, \"000000\" row 4, \"020330\" row 5, \"121331\" row 6, \"111111\" row 7. Compare input vs output: The difference is that rows 1-4 become zeros. And then row 5 becomes \"020330\" vs input row 5 originally \"101001\"? Actually check: original row 5: \"101001\", but output row 5: \"020330\". And row 6 becomes \"121331\" vs original row 6: \"000033\"? Wait, let's match rows: Input: row1: 000000, row2: 022000, row3: 000033, row4: 000033, row5: 000000, row6: 101001, row7: 111111. Output: row1: 000000, row2: 000000, row3: 000000, row4: 000000, row5: 020330, row6: 121331, row7: 111111.\n\nSo it appears that the bottom half of grid (the bottom 3 rows) have been replaced with some pattern. Look at transformation: The top part (rows 1-4) become zeros, and then rows 5,6 are modified somehow.\n\nWait, look at original rows: \nRow2 input: 022000, output row2: 000000 shows that maybe the part that is not zero is being moved upward or something.\n\nLet's check: In example 1, possibly the rule is to take the non-zero elements in the grid, and shift them up by some offset, and then transform them? Alternatively, maybe the rule extracts a \"core\" region from the input that is not the outer border, and then places it in a new position with modifications.\n\nMaybe rule: \"Cut out a shape from the inside of the grid and place it in a specific location\" similar to ARC puzzles.\n\nLet\u2019s compare with Example 2:\nInput:\n00000000 (row1)\n22200000 (row2)\n22200000 (row3)\n00000550 (row4)\n00000550 (row5)\n00000000 (row6)\n80080008 (row7)\n88888888 (row8)\n\nOutput:\n00000000 (row1)\n00000000 (row2)\n00000000 (row3)\n00000000 (row4)\n00000000 (row5)\n05502220 (row6)\n85582228 (row7)\n88888888 (row8)\n\nObserving differences: In input, rows 1-3 become zeros. Then row4 and row5 become zeros in output, but row6 becomes \"05502220\". And row7 becomes \"85582228\", while row8 remains same (\"88888888\"). Let's check what changed: In input, row2 and row3 had \"22200000\" but in output row2 and row3 become zeros. Also, row4 had \"00000550\", row5 had \"00000550\", but in output row4 and row5 become zeros. And then row6 output \"05502220\" seems to be a combination of digits from row2, row3, row4, row5 maybe? Let's attempt to see: row6 output: 0 5 5 0 2 2 2 0. Compare input row2: 22200000, row3: 22200000, row4: 00000550, row5: 00000550. It might be that the transformation is to take a contiguous block from the input, then reflect or rotate it, and then place it in a new position. Possibly the transformation is \"cut out a central region, reflect it vertically/horizontally, and paste it in a new location, while preserving the border.\"\n\nLet's try to see: In Example 1, which rows changed: The input's non-zero sections: row2: \"022000\", row3: \"000033\", row4: \"000033\", row5: \"000000\", row6: \"101001\". But output: row5: \"020330\" and row6: \"121331\". Possibly the transformation is: take the central region excluding top and bottom rows, and then flip it horizontally or vertically. Let's check: In example 1, maybe the source of transformation is rows 2-6, and then they are moved to rows 5-? Actually, see: the output's nonzero rows are row5 and row6. And row7 remains same. In input, rows 1-4 become zeros. So maybe the transformation is: remove the outer border rows and columns (or maybe not).\n\nLet's try to identify common pattern among examples:\n\nLook at example 1:\nInput rows:\nRow1: 000000\nRow2: 022000\nRow3: 000033\nRow4: 000033\nRow5: 000000\nRow6: 101001\nRow7: 111111\n\nOutput rows:\nRow1: 000000\nRow2: 000000\nRow3: 000000\nRow4: 000000\nRow5: 020330\nRow6: 121331\nRow7: 111111\n\nObservation: The bottom row remains unchanged. The top 4 rows become zero. And the middle rows (rows 2-5 input?) are transformed into rows 5 and 6. Which rows? Possibly the transformation is: take the input grid, remove the top row and left and right columns? Alternatively, maybe it's like taking a \"rotated\" view of a shape.\n\nIdea: It might be similar to an ARC task where the transformation is: \"Extract the connected component that is not touching the border, then flip it vertically\" or \"reflect it horizontally\" and then place it into the bottom-left part of the grid.\n\nWait, let's look at the positions of nonzeros.\n\nIn example 1, the non-zero digits in input:\nRow2: digits: at col2: '2'\nRow3: row3: '0 0 0 0 3 3'? Actually, row3: \"000033\" has two 3's at col5 and col6.\nRow4: same as row3: two 3's at col5, col6.\nRow5: \"000000\" is zeros.\nRow6: \"101001\" has 1's at col1, col3, col6 maybe? Actually, row6: \"101001\": digits: col1=1, col2=0, col3=1, col4=0, col5=0, col6=1.\nRow7: \"111111\".\n\nNow output:\nRow5: \"020330\": digits: col1=0, col2=2, col3=0, col4=3, col5=3, col6=0.\nRow6: \"121331\": digits: col1=1, col2=2, col3=1, col4=3, col5=3, col6=1.\nRow7 remains \"111111\".\n\nSo what changed? The nonzero parts seem to come from row2, row3, row4, and row6? Specifically, row2 had a '2' at col2, which appears in output row5 col2 and row6 col2.\nRow3 and row4 had '33' at col5 and col6, which appear in output row5 col4-5 and row6 col4-5.\nRow6 had \"101001\": In output row6 becomes \"121331\", which seems to be modified: original row6 \"101001\" becomes \"121331\". Compare digit by digit:\n- col1: 1 remains 1.\n- col2: originally 0 becomes 2 in output.\n- col3: originally 1 becomes 1.\n- col4: originally 0 becomes 3.\n- col5: originally 0 becomes 3.\n- col6: originally 1 remains 1.\nSo row6 output's changed digits at col2, col4, col5. And row5 output \"020330\": \n- col1: 0, col2: 2, col3: 0, col4: 3, col5: 3, col6: 0.\nIt seems that the transformation is taking two rows from the input and stacking them, with some modifications to some columns. Possibly it's a kind of \"reflection\" or \"rotation\" of a subgrid.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Take the non-boundary inner region of the grid, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, then place it in the bottom-left corner, while leaving the top", "prompt_tokens": 690, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The \"provided examples\" in the conversation are:\n- E.g. 1 Input:\n202010\n000000\n201000\n000000\n300000\n000000\nand Output:\n221\n210\n300\n\n- E.g. 2 Input:\n300020\n000000\n800080\n000000\n001000\n000000\nOutput:\n302\n808\n010\n\n- E.g. 3 Input:\n100000\n000000\n002000\n000000\n600060\n000000\nOutput:\n100\n020\n606\n\nNow, provided test input:\n\n303040\n000000\n700010\n000000\n700010\n000000\n\nWe need to deduce transformation rule. Let's analyze examples.\n\nObserving E.g. 1:\nInput grid: six rows:\nRow0: 202010\nRow1: 000000\nRow2: 201000\nRow3: 000000\nRow4: 300000\nRow5: 000000\nOutput grid: three rows:\nRow0: 221\nRow1: 210\nRow2: 300\n\nObserving pattern: In E.g. 1, input grid rows: row0, row2, row4 are non-zero. They are:\nRow0: 202010 => digits: possibly \"2\", \"0\", \"2\", \"0\", \"1\", \"0\". But output row0 is \"221\". \nRow2: 201000 => output row1 is \"210\"\nRow4: 300000 => output row2 is \"300\".\n\nMaybe we just take the nonzero digits and remove zeros? But not quite: in row0, we have digits: 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0. But if we remove zeros, we get \"2210\"? That doesn't match \"221\". Alternatively, maybe we combine pairs? Let's check row0: 202010 -> maybe splitting into three pairs: \"20\", \"20\", \"10\". Then if we sum each pair? \"20\" becomes \"2\" maybe because 2+0 equals 2, but \"20\" becomes 2? Let's check: row0: pairs: \"20\", \"20\", \"10\". Sum of digits: 2+0=2, 2+0=2, 1+0=1. That would yield \"221\" but the output is \"221\". But check row2: \"201000\": pairs: \"20\", \"10\", \"00\". Sum digits: \"20\" gives 2, \"10\" gives 1, \"00\" gives 0. That yields \"210\". And row4: \"300000\": pairs: \"30\", \"00\", \"00\". Sum digits: \"30\" gives 3, \"00\" gives 0, \"00\" gives 0. That gives \"300\". So it seems transformation rule: For each non-zero row (i.e. rows that are not \"000000\"), take it, split into 2-digit pairs, then sum each pair's two digits (maybe treat them as numbers?) Or maybe do digit-wise addition? Let's check: \"202010\": split into \"20\", \"20\", \"10\". Sum of digits: 2+0=2, 2+0=2, 1+0=1. But what about E.g. 2:\nExample 2: Input grid rows: row0: 300020, row2: 800080, row4: 001000 => Output grid: row0: 302, row1: 808, row2: 010.\nCheck row0: \"300020\". Split into pairs: \"30\", \"00\", \"20\". Sum digits: 3+0=3, 0+0=0, 2+0=2 gives \"302\". Row2: \"800080\": pairs: \"80\", \"00\", \"80\": sums: 8+0=8, 0+0=0, 8+0=8 => \"808\" matches. Row4: \"001000\": pairs: \"00\", \"10\", \"00\": sums: 0+0=0, 1+0=1, 0+0=0 => \"010\". So that fits.\n\nE.g. 3:\nRow0: \"100000\" -> pairs: \"10\", \"00\", \"00\": sums: 1+0=1, 0+0=0, 0+0=0 => \"100\". Row2: \"002000\" -> pairs: \"00\", \"20\", \"00\": sums: 0+0=0, 2+0=2, 0+0=0 => \"020\". Row4: \"600060\" -> pairs: \"60\", \"00\", \"60\": sums: 6+0=6, 0+0=0, 6+0=6 => \"606\".\n\nSo transformation rule: For each non-zero row, split the row string's digits into overlapping 2-digit chunks? But careful: The input rows are 6-digit strings always, but the outputs are 3-digit strings. They are exactly half the length. So transformation: For each row in the input that is not all zeros, do: For i in range(0, len(row), 2): Let left digit = row[i], right digit = row[i+1]. Then output digit = left digit + right digit (as integer addition, then converted to string). But check: In e.g. 2: \"001000\": splitting in pairs: \"00\", \"10\", \"00\" gives digits 0, 1, 0. But then output \"010\" matches.\nWait, but then why are there three lines in output? Because input always has 6 rows, but output has three rows. And the pattern is: The output rows correspond to the input rows with even indices (0,2,4). And they are the result of summing adjacent pairs.\n\nDouble-check: e.g. 1: row0: \"202010\" -> pairs: \"20\", \"20\", \"10\" -> sums: 2,2,1 -> \"221\". row2 \"201000\" -> \"20\", \"10\", \"00\" -> 2,1,0 -> \"210\". row4 \"300000\" -> \"30\", \"00\", \"00\" -> 3,0,0 -> \"300\". So answer.\n\nNow test input:\nTest Input grid:\n303040\n000000\n700010\n000000\n700010\n000000\n\nSo rows: row0: \"303040\", row1: \"000000\", row2: \"700010\", row3: \"000000\", row4: \"700010\", row5: \"000000\".\n\nSo we consider non-zero rows: row0, row2, row4.\n\nFor row0: \"303040\" -> break into pairs: \"30\", \"30\", \"40\". Sum digits: \"30\" -> 3+0=3, \"30\" -> 3+0=3, \"40\" -> 4+0=4. So row becomes \"334\"? Wait, check: \"303040\": digits: index0:3, index1:0, index2:3, index3:0, index4:4, index5:0. So pairs: (3,0) => 3, (3,0) => 3, (4,0) => 4. So row becomes \"334\". But wait, output example e.g. 1: row0 was \"221\" but our computed row0 would be \"334\"? Let's recalc carefully: \"303040\": digits: 3,0,3,0,4,0. Split into: first pair: \"30\": sum = 3+0 = 3, second pair: \"30\": sum = 3+0 = 3, third pair: \"40\": sum = 4+0 = 4. So result \"334\". That is candidate. But wait, check e.g. 2: row0 \"300020\" -> sum digits: \"30\" -> 3, \"00\" -> 0, \"20\" -> 2 gives \"302\". So that's consistent.\n\nLet's check row2: \"700010\": digits: 7,0,0,0,1,0. Split: \"70\" -> 7+0=7, \"00\" -> 0, \"10\" -> 1+0=1, so \"701\". But wait, check row4: \"700010\": same as row2, so \"701\". But wait, wait, check e.g. 3: row2 \"002000\" gives \"020\". So it's consistent.\n\nBut our test input second non-zero row: row2: \"700010\" -> pairs: \"70\", \"00\", \"10\" gives \"701\". And row4: \"700010\" also gives \"701\".\n\nBut that seems odd: row2 and row4 are identical so output will be same row \"701\" repeated? But then output grid has three rows. But the provided examples: each output grid row corresponds to even-index input row. So then final output grid should be:\nRow0: \"334\"\nRow1: \"701\"\nRow2: \"701\"\n\nBut check: in e.g. 1, row0: \"202010\" produced \"221\", row2: \"201000\" produced \"210\", row4: \"300000\" produced \"300\". So the transformation is: For each even-index row, pair the digits two by two", "prompt_tokens": 511, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The digits that change from input to output are from certain rows. Let's try to identify pattern:\n\nLook at Example 1: Input row3: \"002220000000000\". Output row3: same as input, \"002220000000000\". Row4: \"002520000000000\" becomes \"002520000000000\". Row5: \"002020000000000\" becomes \"002420000000000\". So row5 has changed digit: the third digit? Actually, difference: input row5: \"002020000000000\", output row5: \"002420000000000\". The difference is the fourth digit? Let's count indices: It's 15-digit strings. Let's index columns from 1 to 15. For row5, input: \"0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\"? Wait, let's re-read row5: \"002020000000000\". It is \"00 202 0000000\"? Actually, let me count carefully:\n\nRow3: \"002220000000000\": characters: \nIndex: 1:0,2:0,3:2,4:2,5:2,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0.\nRow4: \"002520000000000\": similarly.\nRow5: \"002020000000000\": it's \"00 202 0000000\".\nThe output row5 is \"002420000000000\". So the only difference is the fourth digit: input row5 digit 4 is 0, but output row5 digit 4 is 4? But wait, check positions: Row3: \"002220000000000\" equals output row3. Row4: \"002520000000000\" equals output row4. So row5 is changed from \"002020000000000\" to \"002420000000000\". So the difference is in the digit at position 4? Let's check: The original row5: char1: 0, char2: 0, char3: 2, char4: 0, char5: 2, char6: 0, ... and output row5: \"002420000000000\": char1:0, char2:0, char3:2, char4:4, char5:2, char6:0,... So the digit at position 4 changed from 0 to 4. \n\nNow look at row11: Input row11: \"000000000000002220\". Output row11: \"000444444442220\". So the difference: input row11: initial portion \"00000000000000\" then \"2220\"? Actually, let's check carefully: Input row11: \"000000000000002220\" length 15: indices 1-15: digits: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0? Actually, wait, that's 15 digits? Let's count: \"000000000000002220\": Count zeros: There are 12 zeros then \"2220\"? But then that is 12+4=16 digits. But the grid is 15 columns. Let me re-read the row carefully:\n\nRow11 in example 1 input: \"000000000000002220\". That seems like 15 digits: \"00000000000000\" (14 zeros) then \"2220\" would be 4 digits making 18 digits. So something is off.\n\nWait, re-read carefully. We have 15 rows and each row is 15 characters. But the provided strings might have spaces? Let me recalc: Actually, each row should be 15 characters. Let's count the characters in row11 input of Example 1: \"000000000000002220\". Count: characters: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,0. That's 17 characters. Possibly it's 15 columns? Let's count: Actually, perhaps the grid is 15 rows by 15 columns but the strings are separated by newlines, but the provided ones might be mis-printed? Let me check rows: The first row \"000000000000000\" is 15 digits, second row \"000000000000000\"", "prompt_tokens": 1051, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check row5 input: \"000000400000000000000000000000\". Output row5: \"000000200000000000000000000000\". So the '4' changed to '2'? Wait: Row5 input: \"000000400000...\" but output has \"000000200000...\"\n- Row6: input \"000000400000...\" becomes \"000000200000...\"\n- Similarly row7, row8, row9 become 200000... but row10, row11: check row10: \"000000400000...\" becomes \"000000200000...\"? Wait, check row10: input \"000000400000...\" becomes \"000000200000...\" but row11: input \"000000400000...\" becomes \"000000400000...\"? Let's check carefully:\n\nInput rows:\nRow5: \"000000400000000000000000000000\" -> Output row5: \"000000200000000000000000000000\"\nRow6: \"000000400000000000000000000000\" -> Output row6: \"000000200000000000000000000000\"\nRow7: \"000000400000000000000000000000\" -> Output row7: \"000000200000000000000000000000\"\nRow8: \"000000400000000000000000000000\" -> Output row8: \"000000200000000000000000000000\"\nRow9: \"000000400000000000000000000000\" -> Output row9: \"000000200000000000000000000000\"\nRow10: \"000000400000000000000000000000\" -> Output row10: \"000000200000000000000000000000\" Actually check row10: in E.g. 1 output, row10: \"000000200000000000000000000000\", yes.\nRow11: \"000000400000000000000000000000\" -> Output row11: \"000000400000000000000000000000\", it stays 4, interesting.\n\nSo there is a slight change: In rows 5 to 9, digit '4' changed to '2', row10 changed to '2'? Let's re-read the output: The provided output text:\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nLine 5: \"000000200000000000000000000000\"\nLine 6: \"000000200000000000000000000000\"\nLine 7: \"000000200000000000000000000000\"\nLine 8: \"000000200000000000000000000000\"\nLine 9: \"000000200000000000000000000000\"\nLine 10: \"000000200000000000000000000000\"\nLine 11: \"000000400000000000000000000000\"\nLine 12: \"000000400000000000000000000000\"\nLine 13: \"000000400000000000000000000000\"\nLine 14: \"000000400000000000000000000000\"\nLine 15: \"000000444444000000200000000000\" so row15 remains same? Actually compare row15 input \"000000444444000000200000000000\" and output row15 \"000000444444000000200000000000\" same.\nRow16-Row22 remain same.\nRow23: input \"000600000111000000000000000000\" becomes output \"000611111111000000000000000000\". So row23: digits at beginning: originally \"000600000111\" becomes \"000611111111\"? Let's analyze: \"000600000111\" changes to \"000611111111\". So the part \"600000111\" becomes \"611111111\"? Actually count: \"000600000111\" length 15? Actually check: row23 input: \"000600000111000000000000000000\" output: \"000611111111000000000000000000\".

Actually wait: \"0002000000\" means index 0:0, index1:0, index2:0? Let me check: Actually \"0002000000\" means digits: index0:0, index1:0, index2:0, index3:2, index4:0, index5:0, index6:0, index7:0, index8:0, index9:0. So I need to check carefully: maybe it's \"0002000000\", so digit \"2\" is at index? Let's count: \"0002000000\" is 10 characters. The first three digits are zeros then a digit \"2\", then zeros. But wait \"0002000000\" is ambiguous: \"0002\" then \"0000\"? Actually, let me count: \"0002000000\" 0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0. So the \"2\" is at column index 3. But I see output grids that have \"2\" appear at various positions.\nLet's re-read E.g.1 Input: \"0002000000\" means 10-digit string. But then in output grid, row0: \"0000000000\", row1: \"0000000000\", row2: \"0000000002\", row3: \"0000000022\", row4: \"0000000220\", row5: \"0000002200\", row6: \"0000022000\", row7: \"0000220000\", row8: \"0002200000\", row9: \"0002000000\". So in output grid, the \"2\" digits have moved upward and to the right? Let's check positions: In output row2, there's a \"2\" at column index 9? Actually \"0000000002\": last digit is \"2\" at index9. In row3: \"0000000022\": last two digits are \"22\", so columns 8 and 9 are \"2\". In row4: \"0000000220\": so columns 7 and 8? Actually \"0000000220\": digits: index positions: 0-5: 0, index6:0, index7:2, index8:2, index9:0. In row5: \"0000002200\": digits: index0-4: 0, index5:0, index6:2, index7:2, index8:0, index9:0. In row6: \"0000022000\": digits: index0-3: 0, index4:0, index5:2, index6:2, index7:0, index8:0, index9:0. Wait, pattern: The \"2\" digits seem to be flowing upward and shifting one column left each time, but then also doubling? Let's check carefully.\n\nWait, maybe I'm reading row outputs incorrectly. Let's re-read E.g.1 Output grid:\n\nRow0: 0000000000\nRow1: 0000000000\nRow2: 0000000002\nRow3: 0000000022\nRow4: 0000000220\nRow5: 0000002200\nRow6: 0000022000\nRow7: 0000220000\nRow8: 0002200000\nRow9: 0002000000\n\nI see columns: In row9 input we had \"0002000000\". So in output, the bottom row row9 remains same as input? Actually row9 output is \"0002000000\". In row8, \"0002200000\" meaning column? Let's mark columns indices for each row's \"2\" positions.\n\nE.g.1 Input: row9 \"0002000000\": positions: column index? Let's index columns from 0 to 9. Then \"0002000000\": digits: index0=0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=2, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0, index7=0, index8=0, index9=0.\nNow check output grid row9: same \"0002000000\", so the bottom row remains same.\n\nNow row8 output: \"0002200000\": digits: index0=0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=2, index4=2, index5=0, index6=0, index7=0, index8=0, index9=0.\nRow7 output: \"0000220000\": digits: index0=0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=0, index4=2, index5=2, index6=0, index7=0, index8=0, index9=0.\nRow6 output: \"0000022000\": digits: index0=0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=0, index4=0, index5=2, index6=2, index7=0, index8=0, index9=0.\nRow5 output: \"0000002200\": digits: index0=0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=0, index4=0, index5=0, index6=2, index7=2, index8=0, index9=0.\nRow4 output: \"0000000220\": digits: index0=0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=0, index4=0, index5=0, index6=2, index7=2, index8=0, index9=0? Wait, check: \"0000000220\": digits: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0. So row4 output: positions 7 and 8 are 2.\nRow3 output: \"0000000022\": digits: index0-6: 0, index7:2, index8:2, index9:2? Wait, \"0000000022\" is 10 digits. Let's count: characters: '0','0','0','0','0','0','0','0','2','2'. So row3: index7 and index8 are 2.\nRow2 output: \"0000000002\": digits: index9 is 2.\nRow1 output: \"0000000000\": no 2's.\nRow0 output: \"0000000000\": no 2's.\n\nSo pattern: The input grid had a single \"2\" at row9, column3. The output grid has a \"2\" that has moved upward and rightwards in some pattern. It seems like the \"2\" splits into two copies as it moves upward? Let's check E.g.2:\n\nE.g.2 Input:\nRows: first eight rows are zeros, row9: \"0200000000\". Row9: digits: index0=0, index1=2, index2=0, columns 3...9 zeros.\nOutput:\nRow0: \"0000000002\"\nRow1: \"0000000022\"\nRow2: \"0000000220\"\nRow3: \"0000002200\"\nRow4: \"0000022000\"\nRow5: \"0000220000\"\nRow6: \"0002200000\"\nRow7: \"0022000000\"\nRow8: \"0220000000\"\nRow9: \"0200000000\"\n\nSo row9 input remains same. Now row8 output: \"0220000000\": digits: index0=0, index1=2, index2=2, rest zeros. row7: \"0022000000\": digits: index0=0, index1=0, index2=2, index3=2. row6: \"0002200000\": digits: index0=0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=2, index4=2.\nSo pattern: The starting \"2\" at row9, column1? Actually row9 input \"0200000000\": the \"2\" is at index1. In output, row9 remains same, row8 has two \"2's\" starting at index1 and index2, row7 has two \"2's\" starting at index2 and index3, row6: two \"2's\" starting at index3 and index4, row5: \"0000220000\": two \"2's\" at index? Let's recalc: row5 output \"0000220000\": digits: index0=0, index1=0, index2=0,", "prompt_tokens": 885, "completion_tokens": 2048}

So each example is 5 rows each with 5 columns. Similarly E.g. 3: \"00110, 11100, 01110, 01001, 10011\" and output \"60616, 11186, 66666, 01681, 16861\". E.g. 4: \"01111, 01100, 01110, 00111, 01110\" and output \"06166, 81666, 06118, 06616, 81118\" E.g. 5: \"11100, 00110, 11001, 01111, 00001\" and output \"66108, 86660, 11606, 01666, 66666\". And then test input: \"10111, 10100, 01100, 01110, 10101\" and then additional lines: \"00800, 00888, 88088, 00800, 88080\" then \"06060, 00606, 06006, 00606, 60660\".\n\nWait check test input: Actually test input is given as series of 15 lines? Because I see that after the test input grid, there are 15 lines? Let's count:\n\nTest Input lines: \n\"10111\" \n\"10100\" \n\"01100\" \n\"01110\" \n\"10101\"\n\"00800\"\n\"00888\"\n\"88088\"\n\"00800\"\n\"88080\"\n\"06060\"\n\"00606\"\n\"06006\"\n\"00606\"\n\"60660\"\n\nSo there are 15 lines. They are arranged in 3 groups of 5 rows each. Possibly the examples E.g. 1 to 5 are 5 examples, each containing an input grid of 5 rows and an output grid of 5 rows. And each example is separate. And now the test input is composed of 15 lines, which are 3 groups of 5 rows each. So maybe the transformation rule for each group is applied and then arranged in a vertical stacking? Possibly the test input is concatenation of three separate puzzles, or maybe the transformation is applied to 5x5 grids. But we see 15 lines. But wait, check E.g. 1: There are 5 lines input, 5 lines output. E.g. 2: 5 lines input, 5 lines output, etc. So each example is a 5x5 puzzle. And then test input: 15 lines, which might be 3 puzzles? But then how do we know where one puzzle ends and the next begins? In ARC tasks, the test input is usually a single puzzle. But here, the test input has 15 lines which is 3 * 5 rows. But the examples also have 5 rows each. The test input pattern: It is 15 lines, so it could be one puzzle of size 15? But the examples are 5 rows. Let's check: In the provided examples, each one is exactly 5 rows, not 15. But the test input is 15 rows. But wait, the problem statement \"the user will provide several pairs\" then \"finally, a single test input grid\" but here the test input grid is given as a list of 15 lines. Let me re-read the problem statement: \"The user will provide several pairs of example input grids and their corresponding output grids. They represent a hidden transformation rule. Finally, a single test input grid is provided. Your goal is to deduce the rule from the examples and apply it to the test input grid to produce the correct test output grid.\" Then it shows examples. Then \"Test Input:\" followed by some grid. \n\nMaybe the grid is actually 15 rows but each one is a row in a 15x? Actually, check E.g. 1: The input grid is 5 rows of 5 columns. But if we look at test input, we see 15 lines. So it might be that the test input is three puzzles stacked vertically, each 5 rows, but maybe the grid is 15 rows x 5 columns. But then the output in each example is 5 rows, but in test input, how many output rows? Possibly 15 rows as well? But then the examples E.g. 1 to 5 are provided as pairs. But then the test input is 15 lines, which is not 5 lines. But wait, maybe the examples are not puzzles, but each pair is a mapping from a 5-digit binary pattern to a 5-digit output pattern. And then the test input is not a 5x5 grid, but a 15-digit binary number that is processed in groups of 5 digits. But then the outputs for the examples are not 5-digit binary numbers but decimal numbers? Actually check: E.g. 1 Input: \"10000\" Output: \"16806\". They are not binary, they are decimal digits. The digits might come from binary (0 or 1) but then the output digits include 6, 8 etc. So rule: maybe each cell is transformed depending on neighbors? Possibly the transformation rule is \"rotate\" or \"flip\" the grid? \n\nLet's try to see patterns. We have multiple examples, each with 5 rows of 5 digits. Possibly the rule is something like: For each cell, output digit = some function of the input cell and maybe its neighbors. The outputs are not binary. They include digits like 1,6,8, etc. They might be like rotated 180 degrees? Wait, see E.g. 1: Input first row: \"10000\". Output first row: \"16806\". Compare columns: maybe column 1: input[0][0] = 1 becomes output[0][0] = 1, input[0][1] = 0 becomes output[0][1] = 6, input[0][2] = 0 becomes output[0][2] = 8, input[0][3] = 0 becomes output[0][3] = 0, input[0][4] = 0 becomes output[0][4] = 6. In E.g. 2: first row input \"10101\" becomes output \"10606\". Compare: input digit 1 becomes output 1, digit 0 becomes output 0? Actually, check: \"10101\" -> \"10606\". Let's align positions: col0: 1 -> 1, col1: 0 -> 0, col2: 1 -> 6, col3: 0 -> 0, col4: 1 -> 6. So in E.g. 2, whenever there's a 1 in an even-indexed column maybe? But in E.g. 1, first row: \"10000\" -> \"16806\": positions: col0: 1->1, col1: 0->6, col2: 0->8, col3: 0->0, col4: 0->6. So pattern: maybe the transformation depends on column parity? But in E.g. 2, first row: \"10101\" -> \"10606\". Compare positions: col0: 1->1, col1: 0->0, col2: 1->6, col3: 0->0, col4: 1->6. So in both examples, when input digit is 1, sometimes it remains 1, sometimes becomes 6. Let's check second row of E.g. 1: Input \"11111\" becomes output \"61166\". Mapping: col0: 1->6, col1: 1->1, col2: 1->1, col3: 1->6, col4: 1->6. In E.g. 2, second row: \"01001\" becomes output \"61681\". Mapping: col0: 0->6, col1: 1->1, col2: 0->6, col3: 0->8, col4: 1->1. So it doesn't seem column parity is consistent.\n\nMaybe the rule is: output digit = input digit plus some offset that depends on the count of adjacent 1's or something? Let's try to see differences.

Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" We are given multiple examples and then test input.\n\nWe have the following examples provided:\n\nExample 1 input and output:\nFor Example 1, the input grid lines and output grid lines are:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nLine 1: 000088\nLine 2: 300400\nLine 3: 300400\nLine 4: 000006\nLine 5: 110006\nLine 6: 000000\nLine 7: 005500\nLine 8: 000000\nLine 9: 000000\nLine 10: 222222\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nLine 1: 000000\nLine 2: 000000\nLine 3: 000000\nLine 4: 000000\nLine 5: 000000\nLine 6: 000000\nLine 7: 300488\nLine 8: 300406\nLine 9: 115506\nLine 10: 222222\n\nThe hints: The transformation rule probably involves shifting some \"blobs\" or groups. We need to analyze differences between input and output.\n\nObserving e.g. 1:\n\nLet's denote rows indexed from top as row 1 to row 10. The original input grid has pattern. Let me re-read them:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nRow1: \"000088\" (digits: columns: index 1: '0', 2: '0', 3: '0', 4: '0', 5: '8', 6: '8').\nRow2: \"300400\"\nRow3: \"300400\"\nRow4: \"000006\"\nRow5: \"110006\"\nRow6: \"000000\"\nRow7: \"005500\"\nRow8: \"000000\"\nRow9: \"000000\"\nRow10: \"222222\"\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nRow1: \"000000\"\nRow2: \"000000\"\nRow3: \"000000\"\nRow4: \"000000\"\nRow5: \"000000\"\nRow6: \"000000\"\nRow7: \"300488\"\nRow8: \"300406\"\nRow9: \"115506\"\nRow10: \"222222\"\n\nWhat transformation? Observing that the bottom row (row10) is unchanged: \"222222\" remains same both input and output. The top six rows become all zeros. And then rows 7,8,9 are modified. Let's compare row7 input vs. output: \nInput row7: \"005500\", output row7: \"300488\". Row8 input: \"000000\", output row8: \"300406\". Row9 input: \"000000\", output row9: \"115506\".\n\nIt seems that some numbers are shifted upward? Check row7 input: \"005500\" becomes \"300488\". How do we get \"300488\"? Possibly it is a combination of row2 and row3? Actually, note that row2 and row3 input: \"300400\". That pattern appears in output row7: \"300488\" and row8: \"300406\" and row9: \"115506\" maybe include row5 input: \"110006\". Perhaps the transformation is a \"copy and paste\".\n\nWe see that the bottom row (row10) remains unchanged. The top six rows become filled with zeros. The bottom three rows (7,8,9) have been replaced with some reordering or combination of rows from the top? Let's compare row2 input \"300400\" appears in row7 output \"300488\" and row8 output \"300406\"? But row7 output \"300488\", row8 \"300406\" and row9 \"115506\" maybe represent a transformation. Let's try to see: the left part \"300\" is present in row2? Row2 input is \"300400\", but row7 output is \"300488\". So the first three digits are \"300\". Possibly the top two rows \"300400\" appear in row7 and row8? But then row9 output \"115506\" partly comes from row5 input \"110006\". Wait, row5 input: \"110006\". The output row9: \"115506\". Compare: row5 input \"110006\", output row9 \"115506\". It changed from 1 to 1, then from 1 to 1, then 0 to 5? Let's check carefully:\n\nMaybe the transformation is: The grid is rotated 90 degrees? But then look at row10 output equals row10 input \"222222\". That doesn't match if we rotate.\n\nMaybe the transformation is: The grid is partitioned into two areas: top 6 rows and bottom 4 rows? But then we see the output top 6 rows become zeros. The bottom 4 rows are \"300488\", \"300406\", \"115506\", \"222222\". Those rows come from what? They come from some rows from the input? Wait, let's check: The output rows 7,8,9,10 correspond to input rows? Wait, what is the mapping? The output grid is 10 rows by 6 columns. Possibly the transformation is a \"flip\" along the horizontal axis? The top rows become zeros, bottom rows become a transformation of the original top rows? But then row10 output equals row10 input \"222222\". Let's check: input row10 is \"222222\", it remains same. So maybe the rule is: \"The bottom half of the grid is moved upward, and the top half becomes zeros.\" But then row7 output \"300488\" should correspond to some row from input. Let's try to see: Maybe the transformation is \"move the non-zero digits from the top half to the bottom half while preserving the bottom row\"? Let's analyze non-zero digits in input rows:\n\nInput rows:\nRow1: 000088 -> has non-zero: \"88\" at columns 5 and 6.\nRow2: 300400 -> has non-zero: \"3\", \"0\", \"0\", \"4\", \"0\", \"0\"? Actually, \"300400\" digits: 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0. So non-zero: 3 and 4.\nRow3: 300400 same: non-zero: 3 and 4.\nRow4: 000006 -> non-zero: \"6\" at column6.\nRow5: 110006 -> non-zero: \"1\", \"1\", \"6\".\nRow6: 000000 -> nothing.\nRow7: 005500 -> non-zero: \"5\", \"5\" at columns 3-4 maybe.\nRow8: 000000 -> nothing.\nRow9: 000000 -> nothing.\nRow10: 222222 -> non-zero: all 2's.\n\nNow output rows:\nRow7: \"300488\": digits: 3,0,0,4,8,8. Row8: \"300406\": digits: 3,0,0,4,0,6. Row9: \"115506\": digits: 1,1,5,5,0,6. Row10: \"222222\": same.\n\nMaybe the transformation is: \"read the grid in a spiral?\" Or \"read columns from left to right, top to bottom, and then write them into rows\"? Possibly the transformation is a \"rotation\" of the grid by 90 degrees clockwise? Let's test that possibility on e.g. 1. If we rotate the 10x6 grid clockwise, the output grid should be 6x10. But our output grid is 10x6. So not that.\n\nMaybe it's \"flip vertically\" (mirror vertically). If we flip e.g. 1 input vertically, row1 and row10 swap, etc. Let's try that: flip vertically input would yield:\nRow1 becomes old row10: \"222222\"\nRow2 becomes old row9: \"000000\"\nRow3 becomes old row8: \"000000\"\nRow4 becomes old row7: \"005500\"\nRow5 becomes old row6: \"000000\"\nRow6 becomes old row5: \"110006\"\nRow7 becomes old row4: \"000006\"\nRow8 becomes old row3: \"300400\"\nRow9 becomes old row2: \"300400\"\nRow10 becomes old row1: \"000088\"\nThat doesn't match output.\n\nMaybe it's \"copy the top non-zero segments to bottom\"? Notice that in output, the top 6 rows become all zeros, and the bottom 4 rows are not zeros. Which rows in input are non-zero? Rows 1,2,3,4,5,7,10. But output only has 4 rows (7,8,9,10) non-zero. So maybe the rule is: \"Take the non-zero entries from the top half of the grid and write them to the bottom half in the same order.\" But then row10 remains the same and the others get rearranged.\n\nLet's re-read provided examples E.g. 1 input vs output mapping:\n\nWe have 10 rows. Output rows 1-6 are all zeros. Output rows 7-10 are non-zero. What are they? They are:\nOutput 7: \"300488\"\nOutput 8: \"300406\"\nOutput 9: \"115506\"\nOutput 10: \"222222\"\n\nHow do these relate to input rows?\nMaybe they are \"folded\" along a horizontal axis. I see \"300488\" might be a combination of", "prompt_tokens": 631, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We need to analyze the transformation rule. The examples are likely extracted from the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus tasks. The transformation rule is hidden. We need to deduce the rule from the examples and apply it to the test input grid.\n\nLet's re-read examples carefully:\n\nWe have these examples:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nLine by line:\nRow0: \"7000060000\"\nRow1: \"0090000700\"\nRow2: \"0000500000\"\nRow3: \"6005550609\"\nRow4: \"0055555000\"\nRow5: \"0005550000\"\nRow6: \"0000500060\"\nRow7: \"9000000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000600090\"\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nRow0: \"0000000000\"\nRow1: \"0000000000\"\nRow2: \"0000600000\"\nRow3: \"0006660000\"\nRow4: \"0066666000\"\nRow5: \"0006660000\"\nRow6: \"0000600000\"\nRow7: \"0000000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nObserving pattern: The input grid digits are: They are numbers from 0-9, and output grid digits are 0-9. Possibly the rule might be: find connected groups of identical numbers and replace them with a different number? But note that output has mostly zero except a band \"666\" etc. Let's check: In e.g.1, input grid has \"7\" in some positions, \"0\", \"9\", \"6\", \"5\", etc. But output grid is mostly zeros except rows 2,3,4,5,6 have some pattern: Row2: \"0000600000\" -> that is digit '6' in center column? Actually row2, index 3 is '6'. Row3: \"0006660000\" means indices 3-5 are '6'. Row4: \"0066666000\" means indices 1-7 are '6'. Row5: \"0006660000\", same pattern reversed. Row6: \"0000600000\".\nSo pattern: Essentially a diamond shape of 6's? Wait, let's check coordinates: The output grid: row2: column3 is 6. row3: columns3-5 are 6. row4: columns1-7 are 6. row5: columns3-5 are 6. row6: column3 is 6.\nSo it's not exactly a diamond shape, but a horizontal line? Actually, look at the numbers: row3 has 666, row4 has 66666, row5 has 666. That is \"666\" centered horizontally. But the digits are 6, not 9 or 7. So maybe rule: Possibly find the maximum digit in the input grid? The maximum digit in e.g.1 input is \"7\" in row0 col0, \"9\" in row1 col? Actually, let's check: The non-zero digits in e.g.1: 7,0,0,0,0,0, etc. Actually, list all non-zero digits: there are digits 7, 9, 6, 5 maybe. But output only shows 6. So maybe the transformation rule is: take the two digits that are adjacent in the input grid? But not sure.\n\nLet's analyze example 2.\n\nE.g.2 Input:\nRow0: \"0900000004\"\nRow1: \"0000200000\"\nRow2: \"0000000900\"\nRow3: \"4005550000\"\nRow4: \"0005550000\"\nRow5: \"0005550002\"\nRow6: \"0090000000\"\nRow7: \"2000000400\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0020000200\"\n\nE.g.2 Output:\nRow0: \"0000000000\"\nRow1: \"0000000000\"\nRow2: \"0000000000\"\nRow3: \"0009990000\"\nRow4: \"0009990000\"\nRow5: \"0009990000\"\nRow6: \"0000000000\"\nRow7: \"0000000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nObservations: Only rows 3,4,5 are non-zero. In those rows, columns 3-5 are \"999\". So pattern: A horizontal line of 9's in the middle of the grid. In input, where are non-zeros? There is \"4\" at beginning row3, then \"555\" in rows3,4,5, then \"2\" at end row5, also row0 has \"9\" and \"4\", row1 has \"2\", row2 has \"9\", row6 has \"9\" maybe, row7 has \"2\" and \"4\"? But output only shows \"9\". So maybe transformation takes the digit \"9\" from input and multiplies it? Possibly the rule is: For each contiguous group in the input that forms a plus sign? But then why \"6\" in example1 and \"9\" in example2? Let's check example 3.\n\nE.g.3 Input:\nRow0: \"8040003040\"\nRow1: \"0000000000\"\nRow2: \"3000500800\"\nRow3: \"0040500000\"\nRow4: \"0000500004\"\nRow5: \"0800500000\"\nRow6: \"0000500800\"\nRow7: \"0000000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"4080030040\"\n\nE.g.3 Output:\nRow0: \"0000000000\"\nRow1: \"0000000000\"\nRow2: \"0000400000\"\nRow3: \"0000400000\"\nRow4: \"0000400000\"\nRow5: \"0000400000\"\nRow6: \"0000400000\"\nRow7: \"0000000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nObservations: In the output, only rows 2-6 are non-zero, and in each of those rows, the non-zero digit is \"4\" at column 3? Let's check: row2: \"0000400000\" so digit '4' in column 3, row3: \"0000400000\", row4: \"0000400000\", row5: \"0000400000\", row6: \"0000400000\". So horizontal line of 4's in the center columns (column 3). In input, what are the numbers? There are \"8\", \"0\", \"4\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"3\", \"0\", \"4\", \"0\" in row0, and row9 similarly. Also row2 has \"3000500800\". Not sure.\n\nExample 4:\n\nE.g.4 Input:\nRow0: \"0400000040\"\nRow1: \"0000003000\"\nRow2: \"0060000000\"\nRow3: \"0000000003\"\nRow4: \"0005555000\"\nRow5: \"3000000000\"\nRow6: \"0006000000\"\nRow7: \"0400000000\"\nRow8: \"0000030006\"\nRow9: \"0300000000\"\n\nE.g.4 Output:\nRow0: \"0000000000\"\nRow1: \"0000000000\"\nRow2: \"0000000000\"\nRow3: \"0000000000\"\nRow4: \"0006666000\"\nRow5: \"0000000000\"\nRow6: \"0000000000\"\nRow7: \"0000000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nObservations: Only row4 is non-zero, and in row4, columns 3-5 are \"666\" and then columns 6-8 are \"666\" (so actually row4: \"0006666000\" means indices: 0,1,2: 0; indices 3,4,5: 6; indices 6,7,8: 6; index9: 0). So pattern: Two groups maybe representing two separate items? But then why does it split into two groups? Let's check e.g.5.\n\nE.g.5 Input:\nRow0: \"0000000000\"\nRow1: \"0040000000\"\nRow2: \"0000000000\"\nRow3: \"0005550000\"\nRow4: \"0005550000\"\nRow5: \"0000000000\"\nRow6: \"0000000000\"\nRow7: \"0000000000\"\nRow8: \"0600000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nE.g.5 Output:\nRow0: \"0000000000\"\nRow1: \"0000000000\"\nRow2: \"0000000000\"\nRow3: \"0004440000\"\nRow4: \"0004440000\"\nRow5: \"0000000000\"\nRow6: \"0000000000\"\nRow7: \"0000000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nObservations: Only rows 3 and 4 are non-zero, with \"444\" in columns 3-5.", "prompt_tokens": 999, "completion_tokens": 2048}

And then test input: \"300, 333, 003\". We need to deduce rule transformation.\n\nLet's analyze examples.\n\nTake example 1:\nInput grid:\nRow1: 8 0 0\nRow2: 0 8 0\nRow3: 0 0 0\nOutput grid:\nRow1: 0 2 2\nRow2: 2 0 2\nRow3: 2 2 2\n\nObserving pattern: Possibly rule is \"Inversion\"? But output digits: They are sum of digits? Perhaps each cell is computed as the sum of its neighbors? Or maybe rule is to reflect across center? Alternatively maybe transformation is based on relative difference between adjacent cells?\n\nLet's compare input and output. Look at coordinates: There is a center (1,1) is 8 in input and output is 0. Then corners: top-left is 8 input, top-right is 0 input, bottom-left, bottom-right? Actually let's check: (0,0) is 8 input and output is 0; (0,2) is 0 input, output is 2; (2,0) is 0 input, output is 2; (2,2) is 0 input, output is 2. So the rule seems to be: if a cell is 8, then output becomes 0, if a cell is 0, then output becomes 2? But then what about the other numbers? Wait maybe it's \"complement\" rule: maybe the digit is replaced with (8 - input) maybe? Check: 8-8=0, 8-0=8, but then output is 2 is not 8. Alternatively, maybe rule is: if the cell is the maximum digit, then output is the minimum digit? But not consistent with example 2.\n\nCheck Example 2:\nInput grid:\nRow1: 0 0 3\nRow2: 0 3 0\nRow3: 3 0 0\nOutput grid:\nRow1: 1 1 0\nRow2: 1 0 1\nRow3: 0 1 1\n\nMaybe rule: if cell is 3, output becomes 0, if cell is 0 output becomes 1? But then for cell with 3, 3 output 0. And maybe if cell is 0, output becomes 1. But check Example 1: input 8 becomes 0, input 0 becomes 2. So maybe rule: transform the value by subtracting from some constant? Possibly the sum of digits in the grid? The grid digits in each example might sum up to something? Let's check sum:\nFor example 1: grid digits: 8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0. Sum = 16. Output: digits: 0,2,2,2,0,2,2,2,2. Sum = 0+2+2+2+0+2+2+2+2=14? Actually sum is 0+2+2=4, plus row2: 2+0+2=4, row3: 2+2+2=6, total = 14. Not constant sum.\nMaybe rule is: output cell = difference between neighbor counts? Not sure.\n\nLet's compare positions: perhaps rule is: each cell equals absolute difference between sum of cell's row and column? No.\n\nMaybe rule is: each cell's output equals the number of adjacent 0's or something? Alternatively, maybe rule is: \"complement relative to 8\" but then in example 2, 0 becomes 1, not 8. Alternatively, maybe rule is: each cell's output equals 8 minus input digit? Check example 1: For cell with 8 becomes 0, for cell with 0 becomes 8? But then output should have 8's, not 2's. So not that.\n\nMaybe rule is: each cell's output equals the number of 8's in the input (or maybe the number of ones)? Let's check example 1: number of 8's in input? There are two 8's. But output grid has 0's and 2's. Actually, count the occurrences: 2 appears exactly in positions that are not 8 in input? For example 1, positions that were 0 in input become 2 in output? But then center (1,1) is 8 in input and becomes 0 in output. And (0,1) is 0 in input becomes 2 in output, (1,0) is 0 becomes 2, (1,2) is 0 becomes 2, (2,0) is 0 becomes 2, (2,1) is 0 becomes 2, (2,2) is 0 becomes 2? But then what about (0,0) is 8 becomes 0? So rule might be: if cell is non-zero, output becomes 0, if cell is 0, output becomes 2? But then check example 2: input: positions with 3 become 0, positions with 0 become 1? But then example 3: input: row1: 5,0,0; row2: 5,5,0; row3: 5,0,0; output: row1: 0,4,4; row2: 0,0,4; row3: 0,4,4. So rule: non-zero become 0, zeros become 4? But then example 4: input: row1: 5,5,5; row2: 0,0,5; row3: 0,0,0; output: row1: 0,0,0; row2: 4,4,0; row3: 4,4,4. So rule: non-zero become 0, zeros become 4? But then example 5: input: row1: 0,8,0; row2: 0,8,0; row3: 8,0,0; output: row1: 2,0,2; row2: 2,0,2; row3: 0,2,2. That doesn't match: in example 5, the 8's become 0, but the 0's become 2. But wait, check example 5: For cell (0,0) input 0 becomes output 2, (0,1) input 8 becomes 0, (0,2) input 0 becomes 2; row2: (1,0) 0 -> 2, (1,1) 8 -> 0, (1,2) 0 -> 2; row3: (2,0) 8 becomes 0, (2,1) 0 becomes 2, (2,2) 0 becomes 2. So rule seems: if cell is 8, then output becomes 0; if cell is 0, then output becomes 2; if cell is 5, then output becomes ? Let's check example 3: cell with 5 (first row, first column) becomes output 0 maybe? But then row1 col2 is 0 becomes 4, row1 col3 is 0 becomes 4, row2 col1 is 5 becomes ? Actually row2 col1 is 5 becomes output 0, row2 col2 is 5 becomes 0, row2 col3 is 0 becomes 4, row3 col1 is 5 becomes 0, row3 col2 is 0 becomes 4, row3 col3 is 0 becomes 4. So in example 3, 5 becomes 0? But then row1: first cell is 5 becomes 0, but then row1, col2 is 0 becomes 4, row1, col3 is 0 becomes 4. But wait, check example 4: row1: 5,5,5 become 0,0,0; row2: 0,0,5 become 4,4,0; row3: 0,0,0 become 4,4,4. So rule: if cell is 5, then output becomes 0? But then in example 3, if we apply that rule, then 5 becomes 0, but then what about 0? In example 3, 0 becomes 4. And in example 1, 0 becomes 2, in example 2, 0 becomes 1, in example 5, 0 becomes 2, and in example 6, 0", "prompt_tokens": 541, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Actually, the outputs are given as strings with digits, but in the JSON specification we output as a list of strings? but in the prompt it says: \"JSON list of lists, e.g., [[1,0]]\" but our grids are strings of digits represented as \"0000088888\", but they want final test grid in JSON list of lists, which is probably a list of lists with integer digits.\n\nBut the examples: E.g. 1 Input:\n00000\n00002\n00020\n00202\n02222\n00002\n00220\n00002\n00022\n00000\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n0000088888\n0000208888\n0002080888\n0020208088\n0222200008\n0000208888\n0022080088\n0000208888\n0002200888\n0000088888\n\nLet's try to detect pattern.\n\nObserving E.g. 1:\nInput grid: 10 rows, each row is 5 digits. Output grid: 10 rows, each row is 10 digits? Wait, check: E.g. 1 Input: first row \"00000\" is 5 digits, second row \"00002\" is 5 digits, etc. E.g. 1 Output: first row \"0000088888\" is 10 digits. So doubling width? Wait, no. Let's count: E.g. 1 Input: dimensions: 10 rows x 5 columns? But then output: 10 rows x 10 columns? Possibly rule is \"expand grid horizontally by replicating each digit with a mirror?\" Possibly it's \"rotate the grid and add a mirror image\"? Let's check.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: For each cell, if it's nonzero then add an 8, otherwise add 0? But then why are there 8's appear? Wait, I see: The output grids have digits that are either 0 or 8. But the input grids have digits 0, 2. So maybe rule is: Replace 2 with 8? But then what about 0 remains 0? But then why are digits 2 become 8? But then check E.g. 1: Input \"00002\" becomes \"0000208888\"? Wait, let's analyze E.g. 1: Input row \"00002\" becomes output row \"0000208888\". That seems to be: the left half of output is same as input? But input row is \"00002\" and output row is \"00002\" followed by \"08888\"? But the output row is 10 digits, input row is 5 digits. So maybe rule is: for each input digit, produce two output digits: the first is the same digit, and the second is 8 if the digit is 2, and 0 if the digit is 0? But then check: row 1: \"00000\" becomes \"0000088888\"? That would be: for each 0, produce \"0\" and then \"8\"? But then row becomes \"0000088888\". Wait, but then row 1: \"00000\" becomes \"00000\" then \"88888\": indeed \"0\"+\"8\" repeated 5 times. And row 2: \"00002\" becomes \"00002\" then \"08888\"? But then row 2: \"00002\" -> if we double each digit, then for each 0, it becomes \"08\", and for digit 2, it becomes \"28\"? But then row would be \"00002\" becomes \"00002\"+\"28\"+\"88\"+\"88\"? That would be \"0000228888\"? But the output is \"0000208888\". Wait, let's recalc:\nIf rule is \"for each digit, if digit is 0 then output \"08\", if digit is 2 then output \"28\", then for row \"00002\", we get: for first four 0's: \"08\" each => \"08\"+\"08\"+\"08\"+\"08\" = \"08080808\", and then for 2: \"28\" so total \"0808080828\", which is 10 digits? But that would be \"0808080828\", but actual output row is \"0000208888\". So that's not it.\n\nLet's look carefully at each example.\n\nExamining E.g. 1:\n\nInput grid (5 columns each row, 10 rows):\nRow1: \"00000\"\nRow2: \"00002\"\nRow3: \"00020\"\nRow4: \"00202\"\nRow5: \"02222\"\nRow6: \"00002\"\nRow7: \"00220\"\nRow8: \"00002\"\nRow9: \"00022\"\nRow10:\"00000\"\n\nOutput grid (10 columns each row, 10 rows):\nRow1: \"0000088888\"\nRow2: \"0000208888\"\nRow3: \"0002080888\"\nRow4: \"0020208088\"\nRow5: \"0222200008\"\nRow6: \"0000208888\"\nRow7: \"0022080088\"\nRow8: \"0000208888\"\nRow9: \"0002200888\"\nRow10:\"0000088888\"\n\nObservation: The output grid is bigger by one column? Actually, input rows length 5, output rows length 10. So maybe the transformation is: horizontally mirror the grid? But then why 8's appear? Possibly rule: \"Reflect the grid across its vertical center, but then replace the digits 2 with 8's and 0 with 8's on the right side\"? Let's examine: In E.g. 1, the left half of the output seems to be the input row, and the right half is the mirror image of the left half with some transformation? Actually, check row1: Input row1: \"00000\". Output row1: first five digits \"00000\" then last five digits \"88888\". So it is like input row left half remains same, and the right half is the mirror but with all digits replaced by 8? But then row2: \"00002\" becomes \"00002\" then \"08888\". But the mirror of \"00002\" would be \"20000\" if we reverse the order. But then if you replace 2 with 8 then \"20000\" becomes \"80000\" but output row2 last five digits are \"08888\", not \"80000\". Let's try: maybe it's not mirror. Let's compare row3: Input row3: \"00020\". Mirror it: reversed order: \"02000\". Then if we replace 2 with 8, then becomes \"08000\". But output row3 second half is \"08888\", not \"08000\".\n\nMaybe the rule is: left half is input, right half is the complement of input in some sense, but not mirror. Let's try: row2: input \"00002\", output left half \"00002\", output right half \"08888\". The difference between left half and right half: compare positions: col1: left=0, right=0; col2: left=0, right=8; col3: left=0, right=8; col4: left=0, right=8; col5: left=2, right=8. So maybe rule: The right half is generated by: for each column in input row, if the input digit is 0, output digit becomes 8? But then row3: input \"00020\" left half = \"00020\", right half \"08888\": then first digit: input 0 gives 0? second digit: 0 gives 8? third digit: 0 gives 8? fourth digit: 2 gives 8? fifth digit: 0 gives 8? That pattern doesn't hold because then row1: \"00000\" would yield \"00000\" for right half? But row1 right half is \"88888\". So then maybe rule: The right half is determined by: if input digit equals 0 and it's in an even column? Let's re-read the examples.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is different: Perhaps it's a rotation or reflection of the entire grid. Look at structure: The output grid seems symmetric vertically (first row equals last row, row2 equals row9, etc.) Actually check: In E.g. 1, row1: \"0000088888\" and row10: \"0000088888\". Row2 and row9 are same: \"0000208888\" and \"0002200888\"? Wait row2 is \"0000208888\" and row9 is \"0002200888\", they are not identical. Let's check symmetry: row1 equals row10, row2 equals row9? Actually, row9: \"0002200888\" is not same as row2: \"0000208888\". So not simple vertical symmetry.\n\nMaybe transformation is: reflect vertically and horizontally, then a color inversion? Possibly the rule is: for each cell, if the cell is 0 and on the border, then output becomes 8, and if the cell is 2 then output becomes 0 or 8 depending on position. Let's compare: In E.g. 1, the number 2", "prompt_tokens": 645, "completion_tokens": 2048}

I'll re-read the text.)\n\n\"Example 1 Input: \n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n333333333333333333333\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n333333333333333333333\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\n555355553555555555355\"\n\nThen Example 1 Output: \n\"5555\n5555\n5555\"\n\nWhat transformation did we do? Let's re-read. The input grid is a set of rows. I'll count the rows:\n\nThe block in Example 1: It shows multiple lines. It appears to list 22 rows? Let's count:\n\nRows from provided example 1:\n\nLine1: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine2: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine3: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine4: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine5: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine6: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine7: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine8: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine9: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine10: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine11: \"333333333333333333333\"\nLine12: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine13: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine14: \"333333333333333333333\"\nLine15: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine16: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine17: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine18: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine19: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine20: \"555355553555555555355\"\nLine21: \"555355553555555555355\"\n\nWait, let me check: Actually the provided text \"E.g. 1 Input:\" is a multiline block, but there might be actual grid dimensions. But then \"E.g. 1 Output:\" is:\n\n\"5555\n5555\n5555\"\n\nSo the output is a 3x4 grid (3 rows, 4 columns) of digits \"5\". Wait, but the digits are \"5\" not \"55\"? Let's check carefully the output. It says:\nE.g. 1 Output:\n5555\n5555\n5555\n\nSo each row is \"5555\". So the output grid is 3 rows, 4 columns, with all cells are \"5\".\n\nI need to try and deduce what transformation from the input grid (which is 21 rows? Actually line count: Let's count the lines carefully.\n\nThe provided text \"E.g. 1 Input:\" has lines separated by newlines, but I'll re-read:\n\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line1)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line2)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line3)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line4)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line5)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line6)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line7)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line8)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line9)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line10)\n\"333333333333333333333\" (line11)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line12)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line13)\n\"333333333333333333333\" (line14)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line15)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line16)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line17)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line18)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line19)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line20)\n\"555355553555555555355\" (line21)\n\nYes, there are 21 rows exactly. And each row looks like a string of digits. The digits are either \"5\" or maybe \"3\"? Let's check: The first row \"555355553555555555355\" contains digits \"5\" and \"3\" but mostly \"5\"? Let's count: starting \"5553\" then \"555\" then \"3\" then \"5555555555\" then \"35\"? Not sure, but there are patterns \"5553\" repeated maybe.\n\nWe see \"5553\" appears multiple times. Let me re-read: \"555355553555555555355\". It might be segmented as \"5553\" \"555\" \"3\" \"5555555555\" \"35\"? Let's try to break it: The string length: count digits: It might be 21 digits or 21? Let's count: \"555355553555555555355\". Count manually: \n- \"5553\" is 4 digits, then \"555\" is 3 digits, total 7, then \"3\" is 1 digit, total 8, then \"5555555555\" is 10 digits, total 18, then \"355\" is 3 digits, total 21. So each row is 21 digits. Patterns: The ones with \"333333333333333333333\" are rows with all 3's, length 21, which is row 11 and row 14.\nThe ones with \"555355553555555555355\" have a pattern: They seem to have a structure: Maybe they are composed of three segments: one segment of \"5553\" repeated? \nLet's try to see: maybe the grid is 21 x 21? Actually, the output grid is 3x4. That is a significant reduction.\n\nMaybe the rule is to take a \"border\" or a \"frame\" from the input grid? Possibly it's like \"extract the border\" or \"extract the inner rectangle\"? Let's check: The output grid is 3 rows x 4 columns of \"5\". How might that come from the input grid? The input grid has two distinct regions: region of \"5\" and region of \"3\". The output is all \"5\". Maybe the transformation is to remove rows/columns that have \"3\" and then take the \"5\" region and then further reduce it.\n\nI need to check Example 2 and 3 to see a pattern.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n\"555555855555555585585555585\"\nRows: Let's count rows:\nActually example 2 input is a block of lines:\nLine1: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine2: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine3: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine4: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine5: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine6: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine7: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine8: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine9: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine10: 888888888888888888888888888\nLine11: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine12: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine13: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine14: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine15: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine16: 888888888888888888888888888\nLine17: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine18: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine19: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine20: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine21: 888888888888888888888888888\nLine22: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine23: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine24: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine25: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine26: 888888888888888888888888888\nLine27: 555555855555555585585555585\nLine28: 555555855555555585585555585\n\nWait, count rows carefully:\nThey are 28 rows.

Let's check positions:\nInput: row3: \"000800000000\" so the digit '8' is at column? Actually, \"000800000000\" means position: index 0: '0', index1: '0', index2: '0', index3: '8', index4: '0', then rest zeros. So there is an \"8\" at row3 col3 (if 0-indexing, but not sure if that matters). And then \"300\" appears in row11: \"000000000300\" means digits \"3\", \"0\", \"0\" at last columns? Actually row11: \"000000000300\" implies last three digits are \"300\", with first digit '3', then '0', then '0'. In output, we see row11: \"000000000333\" and row12: \"000000000300\". Also, row3 output becomes \"888800000000\" i.e. row3 changed: originally row3 had \"000800000000\", but now it's \"888800000000\". So it seems transformation: The digit '8' seems to be replicated to fill row above or below? Also, row2 output becomes \"000800000000\"? Wait, check: row1 output: \"000800000000\" is exactly same as input row3? Let's re-read carefully:\n\nE.g.1:\nInput rows:\nRow1: 000000000000\nRow2: 000000000000\nRow3: 000800000000\nRow4: 000000000000\nRow5: 000000000000\nRow6: 000000000000\nRow7: 000000000000\nRow8: 000000000000\nRow9: 000000000000\nRow10: 000000000000\nRow11: 000000000300\nRow12: 000000000000\n\nOutput rows:\nRow1: 000800000000\nRow2: 000800000000\nRow3: 888800000000\nRow4: 000000000000\nRow5: 000000000000\nRow6: 000000000000\nRow7: 000000000000\nRow8: 000000000000\nRow9: 000000000000\nRow10: 000000000000\nRow11: 000000000333\nRow12: 000000000300\n\nObservations:\n- The digit '8' from row3 col? appears in row1 and row2 and row3. Possibly rule: find the first occurrence of a non-zero digit that is not '0'? The input has \"8\" and \"300\" parts. In row3 there is an \"8\" and row11 there is \"300\". They become extended vertical stripes that fill the columns. The output shows that the \"8\" seems to get extended upward to row1 and row2? And the \"3\" from row11 becomes extended downward to row12? And also row3 is extended with 8's to become \"888800000000\"? Let's check columns: In row3, originally \"000800000000\" becomes \"888800000000\". That means the leftmost three digits of row3 become 8's. In row1 and row2, they become \"000800000000\" identical to row3 input? Actually row1 input was all zeros, but output row1 is \"000800000000\". So rule: maybe take the non-zero pattern from the input and then \"grow\" it horizontally? But then row11: \"000000000300\" becomes \"000000000333\" in row11, and row12 becomes \"000000000300\", same as original row11? But output row12 is \"000000000300\" equals input row11? Wait, check: E.g.1, row11 input: \"000000000300\". But row12 output is \"000000000300\", which is exactly the same as row11 input. And row11 output becomes \"000000000333\", i.e. last three digits become all '3'. So rule might be: There are two distinct non-zero elements: one is an \"8\" and one is \"300\" part which is actually two different numbers? Actually, in input row11, we see \"300\", but then output row11 becomes \"333\" which is not the same as \"300\". So maybe the rule is: For each non-zero digit encountered in the grid, fill the entire row or column with that digit in a specific direction? Let's try to see patterns: In E.g.1, the input non-zero patterns: There's an \"8\" in row3 (with a single 8) and a \"300\" in row11. The output: the \"8\" pattern seems to extend upward: It appears in row1, row2, row3 with a block of 8's. And the \"300\" pattern extends downward: It appears in row11 and row12, but with a twist: row11 becomes \"333\" and row12 becomes \"300\".\nWait, let's re-read: row11 input: \"000000000300\". In output, row11 becomes \"000000000333\". Row12 becomes \"000000000300\". So the \"300\" pattern is not simply copied; it becomes \"333\" in the row just above the original row? Wait, check ordering: The input row with \"300\" is row11, but output row11 is \"333\" and output row12 is \"300\". So it seems that the \"300\" pattern is shifted downward by one row in the output: the row below gets the original pattern and the row above gets a modified version where the non-zero digits are turned into the same digit repeated? Let's consider the \"8\" pattern in row3: In output, row1, row2, row3 become \"000800000000\" except that in row3, the left three digits become 8's? Wait, let me re-read row3: Input row3: \"000800000000\". Output row3: \"888800000000\". So the \"8\" pattern is not simply copied from row3, but extended: The block of 8's in row3 now has four 8's contiguous (positions 0-3) versus originally one 8 at position 3? But note: In output row1 and row2, they are \"000800000000\", which is identical to the original row3's pattern, not extended.\nMaybe there is two different patterns: one pattern coming from a single cell and one pattern coming from a sequence of cells. Let's check positions: In e.g.1, the \"8\" is originally at row3, col3? Actually, wait, \"000800000000\": if length is 12 digits, index positions: index0=0, index1=0, index2=0, index3=8, index4=0, then indices 5-11=0. So the \"8\" is at index3. In output, row3 becomes \"888800000000\", so indices 0-3 are 8's. Row1 and row2 become \"000800000000\" i.e. only one 8 remains at col3. So it seems the pattern is that the \"8\" is extended vertically: It appears in row1 and row2 as well, but not extended horizontally? But row3 output is extended horizontally with additional 8's to left of the original 8. So maybe rule: Identify the \"8\" in the grid. Then, for every row between the top-most and bottom-most occurrence of that digit (or maybe in the minimal bounding rectangle), fill that rectangle with that digit, except possibly some border remains? Let's check: In e.g.1, the \"8\" appears only in row3 originally, but then output rows 1,2,3 are filled with 8's in certain columns? Wait, but row1 and row2 didn't originally have 8's. So they got them in output. And row3", "prompt_tokens": 1008, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check: E.g. 1 has 12 rows, each row length 12. So transformation is grid based. Looking at corresponding rows, maybe each row is transformed in some way.\n\nI need to compare corresponding digits in input and output. Let's check row 1 of E.g. 1:\nInput: 0500000005000\nOutput: 0502000005200\n\nLet's index columns from 0 to 11.\nRow 1, col0: input '0' remains '0'; col1: '5' stays '5'? Actually check: input: row1: \"0500000005000\", output: row1: \"0502000005200\". Let's compare char by char:\n\nInput: 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\nOutput: 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0? Wait check: \"0502000005200\" is 12 digits? Let's count: 0,5,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0? Actually \"0502000005200\" is 12 digits? Let's re-read text: \"0502000005200\". Count: 0,5,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0,0? That's 13 digits? Wait, let me check carefully: \"0502000005200\" length = 12 (because we have 12 rows, each row length perhaps 12). Let me count carefully: \"0\" (col0), \"5\" (col1), \"0\" (col2), \"2\" (col3), \"0\" (col4), \"0\" (col5), \"0\" (col6), \"0\" (col7), \"0\" (col8), \"5\" (col9), \"2\" (col10), \"0\" (col11). So yes, it's 12 digits.\n\nSo row1: input: 0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0; output: 0,5,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,5,2,0.\nSo differences: at col3 we have 0->2, at col10 we have 0->2. Also row2: input \"0500055000000\", output \"0502055002200\".\nLet's check row2: input: \"0 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\" output: \"0 5 0 2 0 5 5 0 2 2 0 0\".\nSo transformation: col3 digit becomes 2 instead of 0; col? Let's check row3: input \"5000000500050\", output \"5002002502050\". Compare: input: 5,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,5,0. Output: 5,0,0,2,0,0,2,5,0,2,5,0.\nSo differences: col3 becomes 2, col6 becomes 2, col9 becomes 2, col?

Wait, check col5: input is 5, output is 5? Actually no, input col5=5, output col5=5?

Let's denote input row2: \"23\" followed by zeros. Now output row2: It begins with \"23\", then \"0020030002000030000200003\"? Let\u2019s re-read the output string exactly:\n\"23020030002000030000020000003\"\nWait, let me re-read: Actually let me count: \nOutput example 1: \"23020030002000030000020000003\". Let's count digits: It should be 30 digits. Counting digits: \n2: char positions: \n0: \"2\", 1: \"3\", then \"0020030002 0003000002 000003\"? Wait, I'll re-read carefully:\nE.g.1 Output: \"23020030002000030000020000003\" count digits: \nThe provided output has 30 digits. Let's count manually: \n\"23\" (2 digits) then \"002003\" (6 digits) then \"000200\" (6 digits) then \"030000\" (6 digits) then \"020000\" (6 digits) then \"03\" (2 digits)? That sums to 2+6+6+6+6+2=28? That doesn't add up. Let me re-read the problem statement. It says:\nE.g. 1 Input:\n00000000000000000000000000000\n23000000000000000000000000000\n00000000000000000000000000000\nE.g. 1 Output:\n00000000000000000000000000000\n23020030002000030000020000003\n00000000000000000000000000000\n\nWait, the output row in example 1: \"23020030002000030000020000003\" length? Let's count original input rows are 30 columns. So output row should be 30 digits. Let me count: \"23\" then \"002003\" is 6 digits, so total becomes 8 digits; then \"000200\" is 6 digits, total 14; then \"030000\" is 6 digits, total 20; then \"020000\" is 6 digits, total 26; then \"03\" is 2 digits, total 28. That is 28 digits, but should be 30. Let me check: Actually, maybe I misinterpret. Let me re-read the provided examples carefully. Possibly the first example input grid is different width. Wait, the problem statement: \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then lists three lines:\n\"00000000000000000000000000000\" (that is 30 digits if I count \"0\" repeated maybe 30 times? Let's count: It says \"00000000000000000000000000000\" count: There are 30 digits? Actually, count manually: \"00000000000000000000000000000\" count: There are 30 zeros if each group of 10 is \"0000000000\", so 3 groups = 30. So yes row length is 30.\nThen second row is \"23000000000000000000000000000\", so digits: first two digits \"23\", then 28 zeros.\nThen third row is \"00000000000000000000000000000\".\nOutput row is \"23020030002000030000020000003\". Let's count that: length should be 30. Let's count digits: \"23\" (2) then \"002003\" (6) = 8, then \"000200\" (6) = 14, then \"030000\" (6) = 20, then \"020000\" (6) = 26, then \"03\" (2) = 28. That sums to 28, not 30. Then perhaps I mis-split it. Let's try splitting differently: maybe it's \"23\" then \"0020030002000030000200003\" but that doesn't sum to 30 either. Let's count the digits in \"23020030002000030000020000003\": count manually: Write them out with indices:\nIndex: 1:2, 2:3, 3:0, 4:2, 5:0, 6:0, 7:3, 8:0, 9:0, 10:2, 11:0, 12:0, 13:0, 14:0, 15:3, 16:0, 17:0, 18:0, 19:0, 20:2, 21:0, 22:0, 23:0, 24:0, 25:0, 26:2, 27:0, 28:0, 29:0, 30:3. So the digits at positions:\n1:2, 2:3,\n3:0, 4:2, 5:0, 6:0, 7:3, then 8:0, 9:0, 10:2, 11:0, 12:0, 13:0, 14:0, 15:3, then 16:0, 17:0, 18:0, 19:0, 20:2, then 21:0, 22:0, 23:0, 24:0, 25:0, then 26:2, then 27:0, 28:0, 29:0, 30:3.\nNow group them in triplets? Might be they are drawing diagonals? Let's try to see pattern:\nMaybe pattern: The input row has two nonzero digits at beginning: \"23\". Then output row: The first two digits remain \"23\". Then the following digits follow a pattern \"0020030002000030000200003\". Possibly they are drawn from the nonzero digits? Let's check next examples.\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\nRow1: \"0000000000000000000\" (20 zeros)\nRow2: \"6801000000000000000\" (so first two digits \"68\", then \"0100\", then zeros? Actually \"6801000000000000000\" digits: \"68\", then \"01\", then \"00\", then 16 zeros? Let's check: 20 digits total.)\nRow3: \"0000000000000000000\"\nOutput e.g.2:\nRow1: \"0000000000000000000\"\nRow2: \"6801006000800001000\"\nRow3: \"0000000000000000000\"\n\nCheck transformation: Input row2 \"6801000000000000000\" becomes \"6801006000800001000\". So, the beginning \"68\" remains same, then \"0100\" becomes maybe something changes to \"6000\"? Wait, let's align them:\nInput row2: \"6801000000000000000\"\nOutput row2: \"6801006000800001000\"\nLet\u2019s compare digit by digit:\nPositions: \n1: 6,2: 8, then input digit 3: 0, digit 4: 1, digit 5: 0, digit 6: 0 then zeros until the end.\nOutput row2: \"6801006000800001000\"\nLet's align:\n\"68\" same,\nthen next digits: input: \"0100\", output: \"6000\"? Actually check: after \"68\", input next four digits: \"0100\", output next four digits: \"6000\"? Let's check: output row2 digits 3-6: \"6000\"? Actually, re-read output: \"6801006000800001000\", group digits: \"68\" then \"01\" then \"00\" then \"6000\"???

We have to analyze pattern.\n\nLet's check each example carefully.\n\nWe have a list of examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput grid:\nLine1: \"0000000000\"\nLine2: \"0000000000\"\nLine3: \"0000000000\"\nLine4: \"0000000000\"\nLine5: \"0000000000\"\nLine6: \"0000000000\"\nLine7: \"0000000000\"\nLine8: \"0000000000\"\nLine9: \"0000000000\"\nLine10: \"1121118111\"\nLine11: \"0000000000\"\nLine12: \"0000000000\"\nLine13: \"0000000000\"\n\nOutput grid:\nLine1: \"0000000000\"\nLine2: \"0000000000\"\nLine3: \"0000000000\"\nLine4: \"0000000000\"\nLine5: \"0000000000\"\nLine6: \"0020000000\"\nLine7: \"0010008000\"\nLine8: \"0010001000\"\nLine9: \"0010001000\"\nLine10: \"1121118111\"\nLine11: \"0000000000\"\nLine12: \"0000000000\"\nLine13: \"0000000000\"\n\nObservations: The transformation happened in the lower part? It seems the top part remains same except rows 6,7,8,9 are modified. The rule might be: given a pattern in the bottom row, the rule draws some \"arms\" or \"sides\" around the pattern? Actually, let's re-read: The input has a pattern in row 10: \"1121118111\". That row is kept unmodified in output. The modifications are in rows 6,7,8,9. What exactly changed? Let's compare row 6: input \"0000000000\" becomes \"0020000000\". Row 7: \"0000000000\" becomes \"0010008000\". Row 8: \"0000000000\" becomes \"0010001000\". Row 9: \"0000000000\" becomes \"0010001000\".\n\nSo the modifications appear to be drawing a vertical line on the left? Let's look: The pattern \"1121118111\" row is like a horizontal line pattern? It might be \"mirror\" maybe? Wait, let's check columns: The numbers in row 10: \"1121118111\". Let's label columns indices 0-9.\n\nI sense that the transformation rule might be: draw a vertical line from a corner of the pattern.\n\nIn e.g. 1, the pattern row \"1121118111\" is at the bottom of the grid? Actually, row 10 is pattern row. The modifications in output above it are rows 6,7,8,9. They are drawn with the digits \"0\", \"2\", \"1\", etc. Let's analyze each row:\n\nRow 6 of output: \"0020000000\". That means digit '2' appears at column index 1: \"00 2 000000\"? Actually, let's write indices: col0=0, col1=0, col2=2, col3=0, col4=0, col5=0, col6=0, col7=0, col8=0, col9=0. So, a \"2\" appears at column 2.\nRow 7 of output: \"0010008000\". That means: col0=0, col1=0, col2=1, col3=0, col4=0, col5=0, col6=8, col7=0, col8=0, col9=0. So row7 has '1' at col2 and '8' at col6.\nRow 8: \"0010001000\": col2=1, col6=0? Wait, let's recalc: \"0010001000\": col0=0, col1=0, col2=1, col3=0, col4=0, col5=0, col6=0, col7=1, col8=0, col9=0. Actually, check carefully: \"0010001000\" digits: index0:0, index1:0, index2:1, index3:0, index4:0, index5:0, index6:0, index7:1, index8:0, index9:0.\nRow 9: \"0010001000\" same as row 8.\n\nSo what's the pattern? The pattern row (row 10) is \"1121118111\". Look at positions of changes:\n- There is a \"2\" in row6 at col2.\n- There is a \"1\" at row7 col2.\n- There is an \"8\" at row7 col6.\n- There is a \"1\" at row8 col2 and at row9 col2? Wait, check row8: \"0010001000\": digits: at col2 is 1 and at col7 is 1, row9: same. And row10 remains \"1121118111\". Also, row6: \"0020000000\": digit 2 at col2.\n\nMaybe it's like drawing a \"skeleton\" of the pattern row \"1121118111\" vertically downward from row10? The numbers in the output rows above row10 seem to correspond to the digits in the input pattern row? Let's compare digit positions in row10: \"1121118111\". Let's label positions: index0:1, index1:1, index2:2, index3:1, index4:1, index5:1, index6:8, index7:1, index8:1, index9:1.\nNow, in output rows above, the digits appear in the same column indices? For instance, row7 has a 1 at col2 and 8 at col6. Row6 has a 2 at col2, row7 has a 1 at col2, row8 has a 1 at col2, row9 has a 1 at col2. And row7 has an 8 at col6, and row8 row9 have a 1 at col7. Wait, check row8: \"0010001000\": col7=1, row9: \"0010001000\": col7=1.\n\nMaybe rule: \"Extend the shape drawn in the bottom row upward, creating a vertical projection of the pattern's digits.\"\n\nLet's check Example 2:\n\nInput:\nRow1: \"0000000\"\nRow2: \"0000000\"\nRow3: \"0000000\"\nRow4: \"0000000\"\nRow5: \"0000000\"\nRow6: \"1112111\"\nRow7: \"0000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000\"\nRow10:\"0000000\"\n\nOutput:\nRow1: \"0000000\"\nRow2: \"0002000\"\nRow3: \"0001000\"\nRow4: \"0001000\"\nRow5: \"0001000\"\nRow6: \"1112111\"\nRow7: \"0000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000\"\nRow10:\"0000000\"\n\nSo in example 2, the pattern row is row6: \"1112111\". Let's label digits of that row: index0:1, index1:1, index2:1, index3:2, index4:1, index5:1, index6:1. The transformation in output: Rows 2,3,4,5 are modified. Let's see modifications:\nRow2: \"0002000\": digit '2' at col2? Actually, check: \"0002000\": index0=0, index1=0, index2=2, index3=0, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0.\nRow3: \"0001000\": digit '1' at col2? Wait check: \"0001000\": index2=1.\nRow4: \"0001000\": index2=1.\nRow5: \"0001000\": index2=1.\nAlso, note that row2 has a 2, row3,4,5 have 1's. Compare with input row6: \"1112111\". The digit at index2 is \"1\", but row2 has 2. The digit at index3 is \"2\", but row2 is 2 at col2? Hmm, check row3, row4, row5: They have 1 at col2. \nMaybe the extension is done from the pattern row upward, but with a shift. In example 1, the pattern row \"1121118111\" is at row10, and the modifications appear in rows 6,7,8,9. The distance from pattern row to top modified row: row10 - row9 = 1 row gap? Actually, rows 6,7,8,9 are exactly 4 rows above row10. In", "prompt_tokens": 816, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule.\" There are 3 examples E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3 and then a \"Test Input\" with grid lines. We are to produce a final output grid for the test input.\n\nLet's re-read problem description. We have input and output examples. They are grids represented as strings of digits (0-9) with rows separated by newlines? Actually, the examples are given as 12-digit strings, but then outputs have been given as 4-digit strings? Let's check E.g.1:\n\nE.g. 1 Input: \n```\n000220000000\n002222000000\n023113200000\n221001220000\n221001220000\n023113200000\n002222000000\n000220000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n```\nThis appears to be a 12x12 grid? Wait, count lines: There's lines:\nLine1: \"000220000000\". Actually, wait, the example might be read as a square grid? Actually, careful: The sample \"E.g. 1 Input\" is a grid of digits. Then \"E.g. 1 Output:\" is given as:\n```\n0002\n0022\n0231\n2210\n```\nSo the output grid is 4x4. And the input grid is 12x12. Similarly, E.g. 2: input is 12x12 grid, output is 4x4 grid. E.g. 3: input is 12x12 grid, output is 4x4 grid. So pattern: The input grid is 12 rows of 12 columns, but the output grid is 4 rows of 4 columns. And how do we go from a 12x12 to a 4x4? Possibly by dividing the grid into four quadrants? Wait: In E.g. 1, the input grid has center region maybe? Let's check coordinates.\n\nThe input grid of E.g. 1: \nRow1: \"000220000000\"\nRow2: \"002222000000\"\nRow3: \"023113200000\"\nRow4: \"221001220000\"\nRow5: \"221001220000\"\nRow6: \"023113200000\"\nRow7: \"002222000000\"\nRow8: \"000220000000\"\nRow9: \"000000000000\"\nRow10: \"000000000000\"\nRow11: \"000000000000\"\nRow12: \"000000000000\"\n\nThe output grid is 4x4:\nRow1: \"0002\"\nRow2: \"0022\"\nRow3: \"0231\"\nRow4: \"2210\"\n\nObserving structure: The output grid seems to be the \"quadrant\" of the input grid. Possibly it extracts the middle 4 rows (rows 3-6?) Actually, check indices: For 12 rows, if we want 4 rows, perhaps we take rows 3,4,5,6? But then columns? Let's check: The output grid row1 \"0002\" might correspond to input row 3? Possibly the output grid is the top-left quadrant of the input's central block. Let's check coordinates: The input grid appears symmetric vertically. For example, row3 of input: \"023113200000\", and row4: \"221001220000\", row5: \"221001220000\", row6: \"023113200000\". But the output grid rows: \"0002\", \"0022\", \"0231\", \"2210\". They are similar to row4 and row5? Let's examine pattern:\n\nMaybe the output grid is obtained by taking the input grid's central four rows (rows 3-6 maybe) and then taking every third column? Let's check: The input rows 3 to 6 (if we index starting from 0, then rows 2,3,4,5 if 0-indexed; but since provided outputs are 4 rows, it means maybe we take rows 3,4,5,6 if 1-indexed?) Let's check row 3 (1-indexed): \"023113200000\". If we take columns with indices 1,2,3,4? Actually, output row1 is \"0002\". If we take row3 of input: \"023113200000\", then if we take columns 1-4 (if we assume 0-indexed, that's digits positions 0,1,2,3) gives \"0231\" but output row1 is \"0002\". Alternatively, maybe we take the central 4 rows and then extract a 4-digit string from each row by taking the digits in columns 8-11 maybe? Let's try: For row3: \"023113200000\", columns 8-11 (0-indexed: indices 8,9,10,11) are \"0000\", not matching. Let's try columns 2-5 for row3: \"2301\"? Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is not simply extraction from the input grid; maybe it is some pattern extraction. The given examples seem symmetric. Look at E.g. 1: The output is \"0002\", \"0022\", \"0231\", \"2210\". And the input grid has a diamond shape? Actually, the input grid appears to have symmetry horizontally and vertically. Let's re-read examples in more detail.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: \"Take the outer border of the input and extract the non-zero pattern\"? But in E.g. 1, the output grid \"0002\" has a \"2\" at the end only. Look at the first row of output: \"0002\". Possibly extracted from the top right corner of the input? Let's check: The input top row row1: \"000220000000\". The last 4 digits of row1: \"0000\" but that doesn't match.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: \"Extract the subgrid that is the central 1/3 of the grid.\" Because 12/3 = 4, so maybe each dimension is divided by 3. But 12/3 = 4 exactly, so the output grid is a 4x4 block taken from the input grid. Which block? Possibly the central block? For E.g. 1, if we take rows 3 to 6 (using 1-indexed, that is rows 3,4,5,6) and columns 3 to 6 (columns 3,4,5,6) then let's check: For row3: columns 3-6: digits? Let's index: row3: \"023113200000\".\nIndex positions (1-indexed): col1=0, col2=2, col3=3, col4=1, col5=1, col6=3, col7=2, col8=0, ... so columns 3-6 are \"3123\". That doesn't match \"0002\".\n\nAlternatively, if we take rows 2 to 5 and columns 2 to 5 maybe? Let's try: For row2: \"002222000000\", columns 2-5: \"2222\"? But output row1 is \"0002\". So no.\n\nMaybe we take rows 3,4,5,6 and columns 8-11? For row3: \"023113200000\", columns 8-11: \"0000\" -> doesn't match \"0002\".\n\nMaybe we take rows 3,4,5,6 and columns 1-4? For row3: \"023113200000\", columns 1-4: \"0231\" but output row1 is \"0002\". So maybe it's rotated? If we rotate 90 degrees? Check: If we take row3 of input \"023113200000\" and rotate it 90 degrees, then row3 becomes column something? Not sure.\n\nMaybe the rule is to take the outer border of the input grid? For E.g. 1, if we take the border of the 12x12, we get a 12x12 border, but then extract something? That doesn't seem to yield 4 rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: \"Take the four quadrants of the grid, and then do a further transformation to reduce dimension by extracting some pattern from each quadrant.\" Notice that the output grid for E.g. 1 is 4x4, which is exactly 1/3 of 12 in both dimensions if you consider 12/3=4. But 12 divided by 3 is 4, but not 3. Actually, 12/3=4, so maybe the rule is: \"Subdivide the grid into 9 equal smaller squares (3x3 each) and then take the center square of each?\" But 12/3 = 4, not 3. Wait, 12/3 = 4 means if we divide rows into 3 equal parts, each part has 4 rows. And similarly for columns. That would yield a 3x3 block of subgrids. But output is 4x4, not 3x3.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Crop out the innermost 4 rows and 4 columns?\" Let's check: For E.g. 1, if we take the middle 4 rows, which rows? Possibly rows 4,5,6,7 if 1-indexed? That would be rows 4 to 7. Let's check:", "prompt_tokens": 697, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's examine the examples: We have several examples: Example 1, Example 2, Example 3, Example 4. Problem has examples with pairs of input and output grids. They are presumably images (grid puzzles) from ARC tasks. We are asked to deduce the transformation rule from these examples and then apply it to the test input grid.\n\nWe have examples. Let's re-read them carefully.\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n```\n00000\n00000\n00000\n00000\n00400\n00000\n22222\n```\nE.g. 1 Output:\n```\n00000\n00000\n00000\n40004\n04040\n00400\n22222\n```\nObservations: In e.g.1, the input grid is 7 rows x 5 columns. The output grid is 7 rows x 5 columns. What transformation happened? The input grid had a pattern: There is one \"4\" in row 5 (0-indexed row 4) in column 3 (0-indexed?), specifically \"00400\" row. The output grid has pattern: The row that was originally row 5 in input now has become row 4? Actually, let's label rows in example 1 with indices starting at 0:\n\nInput:\nRow0: \"00000\"\nRow1: \"00000\"\nRow2: \"00000\"\nRow3: \"00000\"\nRow4: \"00400\"\nRow5: \"00000\"\nRow6: \"22222\"\n\nOutput:\nRow0: \"00000\"\nRow1: \"00000\"\nRow2: \"00000\"\nRow3: \"40004\"\nRow4: \"04040\"\nRow5: \"00400\"\nRow6: \"22222\"\n\nObserving the differences: the original \"00400\" moved from row 4 to row 5? Wait, check positions: In input, row4 is \"00400\", but in output, row4 is \"40004\"? Let's re-read the output carefully:\n\nWait, let's re-read the provided e.g. 1 output. It is given as:\n```\n00000\n00000\n00000\n40004\n04040\n00400\n22222\n```\nSo row indices:\nRow0: \"00000\"\nRow1: \"00000\"\nRow2: \"00000\"\nRow3: \"40004\"\nRow4: \"04040\"\nRow5: \"00400\"\nRow6: \"22222\"\n\nNow compare with input:\nRow0: \"00000\"\nRow1: \"00000\"\nRow2: \"00000\"\nRow3: \"00000\"\nRow4: \"00400\"\nRow5: \"00000\"\nRow6: \"22222\"\n\nSo the transformation: The \"4\" digits seem to be rotated? Possibly the transformation is rotation of a certain sub-grid. Let\u2019s check: In input row4, we had \"00400\". In output row3, we have \"40004\". In output row4, \"04040\" and output row5 \"00400\". It looks like the submatrix \"00400\" rotated 90 degrees clockwise? Let's check: The submatrix might be a 3x3 center? Wait, \"00400\" is a 5 wide string. Actually, look at coordinates:\n\nInput row4: \"00400\" means digits: column0=0, column1=0, column2=4, column3=0, column4=0.\nNow in output, the pattern \"40004\" appears in row3, \"04040\" in row4, and \"00400\" in row5. Looks like if we take the \"4\" from the input \"00400\", then it rotates around the center? Wait, 3 rows and 5 columns, if we rotate that sub-grid by 90 degrees clockwise, the center element remains at center. Let's check: Coordinates for input subgrid: rows 3 to 5, columns 0 to 4. But input row3 was \"00000\", row4 \"00400\", row5 \"00000\". So the subgrid is:\n\nRow3: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 4 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 0\n\nNow if we rotate that matrix by 90 degrees clockwise, what do we get? For 3x5, rotation 90 degrees clockwise: The new subgrid would have dimensions 5x3. But the output grid is 7 rows x 5 columns. So likely the transformation rotates the bounding box of the 4's. But here the output rows are still 7 rows x 5 columns. Wait, check: In output, the subgrid corresponding to the rotated \"4\" appears in rows 3,4,5. But the pattern in output row3 is \"40004\" (5 digits). Row4 is \"04040\", row5 \"00400\". That is a pattern of a plus sign? Let's see: \"40004\" has 4's at column0 and column4, row4 \"04040\" has 4's at column1 and column3, and row5 \"00400\" has 4's at column2? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternate possibility: The transformation rule might be: Reflect the grid horizontally or vertically, or shift positions of 4's in some symmetric pattern. Look at the pattern: In example 1, input had a single \"4\" at row4, column2. And output has three rows with \"4\": row3: \"40004\", row4: \"04040\", row5: \"00400\". That pattern is exactly the \"X\" pattern from the cross that is produced by taking the cross centered on the \"4\" and then drawing a cross with arms of length 2. But wait, check: The center of output pattern is row4, column2 is \"4\". And then in row3, column2 is \"0\"? Actually, let's identify positions exactly:\n\nRow3 output: \"40004\". That means: col0 = 4, col1 = 0, col2 = 0, col3 = 0, col4 = 4.\nRow4 output: \"04040\": col0 = 0, col1 = 4, col2 = 0, col3 = 4, col4 = 0.\nRow5 output: \"00400\": col0 = 0, col1 = 0, col2 = 4, col3 = 0, col4 = 0.\n\nSo the output pattern for the rotated \"4\" now forms a plus sign rotated 45 degrees? Not exactly. Wait, if we put coordinates: The input had 4 at (row4, col2). The output pattern appears to have 4's at (3,0), (3,4), (4,1), (4,3), (5,2). That is like a diamond shape. In fact, if you take the point (4,2) and then draw a diamond with Manhattan distance <=1, you'd get (4,1), (4,3), (3,2), (5,2) but here we have (3,0) and (3,4) and (5,2) but not (3,2) or (5,0) etc. Let's check: The diamond of radius 2 in Manhattan distance would be (4,0), (4,4), (3,1), (3,3), (2,2), (5,1), (5,3), (6,2), (0,2) etc. But here it's different.\n\nMaybe it's not diamond but rather a rotation of a 3x3 square with the center being the input \"4\", and then fill in the corners with additional \"4\"s. In fact, if you take the 3x3 block centered on the input \"4\" (that is rows 3,4,5 and columns 1,2,3 maybe), then rotate it? Let's try: The input \"4\" is at (4,2). Consider the 3x3 square with center (4,2) and corners: row3: columns 1,2,3; row4: columns 1,2,3; row5: columns 1,2,3. That subgrid is:\nRow3: (3,1)=0, (3,2)=0, (3,3)=0.\nRow4: (4,1)=0, (4,2)=4, (4,3)=0.\nRow5: (5,1)=0, (5,2)=0, (5,3)=0.\nIf we rotate that 3x3 block 180 degrees, we get:\nRow3: becomes row? Actually, 180 rotation: (3,1) goes to (3,3) etc. But then output would be: row3: \"000\", row4: \"000\", row5: \"000\" with 4 in center? That doesn't match.\n\nAlternate idea: maybe it's a reflection along both diagonals. Let's check: In e.g.1, the only non-zero digit was 4 at (4,2). After transformation, we see a pattern of 4's that form a rotated version of the shape of the digit \"4\" from the input. Possibly the rule is: Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise and then reflect vertically? Let's test: If we rotate e.g.1 input 90 degrees clockwise, the 4 at (4,2", "prompt_tokens": 705, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" And then we are given E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, and then \"Test Input\", then answer as final grid output (in JSON list of lists representation). The problem: We need to look at the examples and deduce transformation rule.\n\nWe have three examples. Let's re-read examples carefully.\n\nWe have example 1:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nLine 1: \"00010000000000000000000\"\nLine 2: \"01111100000000000000000\"\nLine 3: \"01000100000000000000000\"\nLine 4: \"01101100000000000000000\"\nLine 5: \"00101000000000000000000\"\nLine 6: \"00000000001000000000000\"\nLine 7: \"00000000111110000000000\"\nLine 8: \"00000000011100000000000\"\nLine 9: \"00000001110111000000000\"\nLine 10: \"00000000000000000000000\"\nLine 11: \"00000000000000000000000\"\nLine 12: \"00000000000000100100000\"\nLine 13: \"00000000000000011000000\"\nLine 14: \"00000000000000011000000\"\nLine 15: \"00000000000000100100000\"\nLine 16: \"00000011000000011000000\"\nLine 17: \"00000111000000000000000\"\nLine 18: \"00001110000000000000000\"\nLine 19: \"00000100000000000000000\"\nLine 20: \"00000000000000000000000\"\nLine 21: \"00000000000000000000000\"\nLine 22: \"00000000000000000000000\"\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n\"0011\"\n\"0111\"\n\"1110\"\n\"0100\"\n\nObserving: The output is a 4x4 grid. The input was 22 rows by maybe 22 columns? Actually count: each line appears to be 22 characters maybe. Let's see: \"00010000000000000000000\" length? Count digits: \"00010000000000000000000\" is 22 characters? Let's check: 0001 00000000000000000000. Yes, likely 22 columns, 22 rows.\n\nNow the transformation: It seems that the output is a \"pattern\" extracted from the input such that only some parts are used. Observing the positions of non-zero digits in input? Possibly rule: Copy nonzero digits from input to output grid, but then rotate? But then output grid has only 4 rows and 4 columns. How to get that from a 22x22 grid?\n\nMaybe the rule is \"find all clusters of a specific number (like 1?)? But then output grid is 4x4, and in input, digits '1' appear in particular pattern. Let's see: In example 1, the interesting digits are '1's. Look at the input: There are many zeros, but in some rows we see 1's. Where? Row 1: \"00010000000000000000000\" has a '1' at column 4? Actually index: if counting columns starting from 1, then \"0001\" then \"00000000000000000000\". So row1: digit 1 at column 4.\nRow2: \"01111100000000000000000\", so digits: starting with \"0\", then \"1\", then \"1111\"? Actually careful: \"011111\" means row2: index1:0, index2:1, index3:1, index4:1, index5:1, index6:1, then zeros.\nRow3: \"01000100000000000000000\": digits: column2 is 1, column5 is 0? Actually \"010001\" means maybe 0,1,0,0,0,1? Let's check: \"010001\" equals: 0,1,0,0,0,1, then zeros. Row4: \"01101100000000000000000\": equals 0,1,1,0,1,1, etc.\nRow5: \"00101000000000000000000\": equals 0,0,1,0,1,0, etc.\nRow6: \"00000000001000000000000\": equals 0,... then 1 at column? It has \"000010\"? Actually \"00000000001000000000000\": there are probably 5 zeros then 1 then 5 zeros. It's not clear.\n\nMaybe the rule is to extract a submatrix from a larger input matrix using some pattern that picks out positions that are \"on\" (digit 1) and then compress them into a smaller grid? But output grid digits are not only 0s and 1s; they are 0,1,3, etc? Wait, check E.g. 1 Output: \"0011\", \"0111\", \"1110\", \"0100\". They are digits 0 and 1 only. But then E.g. 2 Output: \"00020\", \"02220\", \"20202\", \"02200\". Contains digit 2, and 0. E.g. 3 Output: \"3000003\", \"0303030\", \"0033300\", \"0333330\", \"0000300\". Contains digits 0,3.\n\nSo transformation rule might be: Given an input grid that has some \"pattern\" that is a sort of \"drawing\" in the grid, and then the transformation extracts a smaller grid that is a sort of \"compressed\" version of the pattern. Perhaps the rule is to take the coordinates of the non-zero digits in the input and then draw a grid where each cell is determined by whether it's inside the shape of the drawing? However, the outputs are not binary; they sometimes have digits greater than 1 (like 2 and 3). They might represent different layers or different \"strokes\" of the pattern.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Given an input grid with sparse non-zero markers, output a grid that is the \"bounding box\" of the pattern, with each cell's value corresponding to the number of non-zero markers in that region's corresponding positions?\" Possibly count of 1's in some region? But then E.g. 1: The output is 4x4, and input has many rows. Maybe the rule is to take the top-left 4x4 submatrix of the input that is \"active\"? But then row1 of the input is \"00010000000000000000000\", and the first 4 characters are \"0001\". That exactly equals row1 of output. Similarly, row2 of input first 4 characters are \"0111\", which equals row2 output. Row3: \"0100\", row4: \"0110\"? But output row3 is \"1110\", row4: \"0100\"? Let's check row4 in input: \"01101100000000000000000\", first 4 characters: \"0110\", but output row4 is \"0100\". So not simply taking first 4 columns.\n\nMaybe it's taking a \"diagonal\" pattern? Let's align indices: The output is 4 rows and 4 columns. Maybe the rule is: \"Find the positions of the non-zero digits in the input, then determine the smallest bounding box that contains all non-zero digits, and then fill that bounding box with counts that represent the number of non-zero digits in each \"pixel\" of a transformed grid?\" Possibly each cell in the output corresponds to a 5x5 block in the input? Let\u2019s check dimensions: E.g. 1 input is 22 rows, output is 4 rows. 22/4 is not integer. But maybe the rule is: \"Zoom out: each output cell corresponds to a block of 5x5 in the input?\" 5*4 = 20, but input is 22 rows, so maybe border remains? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is: \"Remove rows and columns that are all zeros, then crop to smallest rectangle, then mirror along diagonal?\" But then E.g. 1: The non-zero digits appear scattered. There is a cluster near top? Actually, look at rows with non-zero: row1 has a 1 at col4, row2 has ones at col2-col7, row3 has ones at col2 and col6, row4 has ones at col2, col3, col5, col6, row5 has ones at col3 and col5, row6 has one at col? row6: \"00000000001000000000000\". There is a '1' in the middle maybe col11. Then row7: \"00000000111110000000000\", so ones from col9 to col13 maybe. Row8: \"00000000011100000000000\", row9: \"00000001110111000000000\", row10: all zeros, row11: all zeros, row12: \"00000000000000100100000\", so ones at col? row13: \"00000000000000011000000\", row14 same, row15 same as row12, row16: \"00000011000000011000000\", row17: \"00000111000000000000000\", row18", "prompt_tokens": 1198, "completion_tokens": 2048}

There's a pattern: The grid has mostly zeros, but there is a vertical column of 3's in the middle? Let's check: In each row of first part (lines 1 to 5) we see \"00000003000000000000\". I see \"00000003\" then \"0000000000\"? Wait, let's count columns: The string \"00000003000000000000\" is 20 characters. They have \"00000003\" at the start? Let's count: For \"00000003\" is 8 characters, then \"0000000000\" is 10 more? That sums to 18, but we need 20. Let me count properly: \"00000003000000000000\"\nI can count: digits: positions:\n1:0\n2:0\n3:0\n4:0\n5:0\n6:0\n7:0\n8:0? Actually \"00000003\" has 8 digits if we count \"0000000\" = 7 zeros and then 3? Wait, I need to count manually: The string \"00000003\" is 8 digits if it is \"00000003\" but it seems \"00000003\" is 8 digits: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3\". Then after that \"0000000000\" is 10 zeros, total 18, but then there is \"00000003\"? I'm confused. Let's count properly: Provided \"00000003000000000000\". I'll count characters: \n- Count digits: \n\"00000003\" that's 8 digits if it's \"00000003\" (7 zeros and then 3).\nThen \"0000000000\" is 10 zeros, so sum becomes 8+10=18, but we need 20 digits. So maybe it's \"00000003\" then \"0000000000\" is 10 digits, so total 8+10 = 18, not 20. Possibly I'm miscounting: Let's recalc: The given string \"00000003000000000000\" might be 20 digits. I'll count: \n1: 0\n2: 0\n3: 0\n4: 0\n5: 0\n6: 0\n7: 0\n8: 0? Possibly better: I'll count manually by grouping: \"00000003\" (8 digits) then \"0000000000\" (10 digits) then \"00000003\"? That yields 8+10+? Wait, the string \"00000003000000000000\" is ambiguous. Let's check E.g. 2: \"0000003000\" is 10 digits. Let's count: \"0000003000\" has 10 digits. So in E.g. 1, maybe each row is 20 digits. So counting: \"00000003\" is 8 digits, then \"0000000000\" is 10 digits, total 18, but we need 20. Possibly it's \"00000003\" (8 digits) then \"0000000000\" (10 digits) then that makes 18. Let me count: Actually, maybe \"00000003\" is 9 digits if we include an extra zero? Let's count each digit: \nThe given text: \"00000003000000000000\"\nI'll count by splitting into groups: It might be \"00000003\" then \"0000000000\" then \"00000003\"? That doesn't add up.\n\nMaybe I can count by grouping: There are 20 characters because I see \"33333333333333333333\" is clearly 20 characters (since 33333333333333333333 is 20 digits, because 20*3=60 digits? Actually no, 33333333333333333333 is 20 digits if each digit is 3? Wait, no, 33333333333333333333, count: It should be 20 if they are evenly spaced. Let's count: There are 20 lines, each has 20 digits? In e.g. 1, the output line \"33333333333333333333\" is 20 digits. So input lines in e.g. 1 should also be 20 digits. So each string in e.g. 1 is 20 digits. Let me count \"00000003000000000000\": I'll count manually with positions:\nPosition 1: 0\n2: 0\n3: 0\n4: 0\n5: 0\n6: 0\n7: 0\n8: 0? Wait, I need to be careful. Let me count with indices:\nFor \"00000003000000000000\", I'll mark indices:\nIndex: char:\n1: 0\n2: 0\n3: 0\n4: 0\n5: 0\n6: 0\n7: 0\n8: 0? That would be 7 zeros if I'm", "prompt_tokens": 887, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We have three examples given - E.g. 1 and E.g. 2 and E.g. 3. And then a Test Input grid provided. We're asked: \"You are an expert in solving ARC problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule.\" And then \"Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" We have to output our reasoning in <thinking> and final answer in <answer>. The answer should be in JSON list-of-lists.\n\nLet's read examples carefully.\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput grid:\nLine 0: \"00000000000000\"\nLine 1: \"00000000000000\"\nLine 2: \"00000000000000\"\nLine 3: \"00000000000000\"\nLine 4: \"23000000000000\"\nLine 5: \"11000000000000\"\nLine 6: \"00000000000000\"\nLine 7: \"00000000000000\"\nLine 8: \"00000000000000\"\nLine 9: \"00000000000000\"\n\nOutput grid:\nLine 0: \"00000000000000\"\nLine 1: \"00000022223333\"\nLine 2: \"00000022223333\"\nLine 3: \"00223322223333\"\nLine 4: \"23223322223333\"\nLine 5: \"11111111111111\"\nLine 6: \"00111111111111\"\nLine 7: \"00000011111111\"\nLine 8: \"00000011111111\"\nLine 9: \"00000000000000\"\n\nObservations:\n- The input grid has two numbers in two rows: row4 has \"23000000000000\" and row5 has \"11000000000000\". They are digits? They are \"2\", \"3\" then zeros, and \"1\", \"1\" then zeros.\n- The output grid has some digits: row1: \"00000022223333\", row2: \"00000022223333\", row3: \"00223322223333\", row4: \"23223322223333\", row5: \"11111111111111\", row6: \"00111111111111\", row7: \"00000011111111\", row8: \"00000011111111\".\n- Let's examine transformation: Possibly the rule is: \"Starting from the non-zero digits in the input, fill in to the left and right with their digits, and then fill in rows above and below based on some rule with digits gradually increasing?\" Wait, alternative interpretation: Possibly the rule is \"draw a stroke\" from the center? Wait, let me re-read each example.\n\nMaybe the transformation is like \"draw two lines from the given digits\" but then fill them with repeating digits. Let's see: In e.g. 1, the non-zero digits are at row4, columns? Actually, check: row4 \"23000000000000\": so column 0: '2', column1: '3' then columns 2-13 are all zeros (if the length is 14 characters). row5 is \"11000000000000\": column 0: '1', column1: '1'. And the output: row4 now is \"23223322223333\". Let me check row4 output in e.g. 1: \"23223322223333\". It has 14 characters. Compare with input row4: \"23000000000000\". So row4 output seems to have digits at indices:\n- index 0: '2' (same as input). \n- index 1: '3' (same as input).\n- then index 2: '2'? But input index2 was '0'? But output index2 is '2'. \n- index 3: '2'? Actually, let me re-read: \"23223322223333\" means: char0: '2', char1: '3', char2: '2', char3: '2', char4: '3', char5: '3', char6: '2', char7: '2', char8: '2', char9: '2', char10: '3', char11: '3', char12: '3', char13: '3'. Not sure.\nMaybe I'll re-read the output:\nRow1: \"00000022223333\"\nRow2: \"00000022223333\"\nRow3: \"00223322223333\"\nRow4: \"23223322223333\"\nRow5: \"11111111111111\"\nRow6: \"00111111111111\"\nRow7: \"00000011111111\"\nRow8: \"00000011111111\"\nRow9: \"00000000000000\"\nRow0: \"00000000000000\"\n\nLook at row4: It seems to be composed of two segments: left part \"232233\" and right part \"2222333\"? Let me try to see a pattern:\nMaybe the rule is: find the pair of non-zero digits in the bottom part (like row5 \"110000\") and then fill the grid with some \"stroke\" pattern. We see numbers \"1\" and \"2\" and \"3\". How they appear? Let's check row5 in output: \"11111111111111\". It's all ones. Row6: \"00111111111111\" is mostly ones but with a leading zero. And row7 and row8: \"00000011111111\" etc. So maybe the rule is: \"duplicate the non-zero digits upward and downward, then fill with copies of themselves to form a pattern that radiates outward.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: \"Given two digits in the bottom row (or not exactly bottom row, but near bottom) then draw a pattern that extends from those digits upward in a diamond shape or a cross shape.\"\n\nLet me check coordinates: In e.g. 1, the non-zero digits appear in row4 and row5? Actually, which rows are non-zero? row4 is \"2300000...\", row5 is \"110000...\". And the output grid: the bottom-most row (row9) is all zeros. Row8: \"00000011111111\". Row7: \"00000011111111\". Row6: \"00111111111111\". Row5: \"11111111111111\". Row4: \"23223322223333\". Row3: \"00223322223333\". Row2: \"00000022223333\". Row1: \"00000022223333\". Row0: \"00000000000000\".\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"From the given non-zero cells, extend a vertical stroke upward and downward, and then fill with digits from the input, repeating them, and then fill the rest with zeros.\" But then what about the pattern \"22223333\" and \"11111111111111\"? Possibly the rule is: \"The leftmost non-zero digit in the bottom row becomes a \"1\" and the rightmost becomes a \"3\" and then they fill in between with \"2\"s.\" But then row 4 output: \"23223322223333\" - the left two digits are \"2\" and \"3\" from the input, but then the pattern is repeated. In row3: \"00223322223333\", the pattern seems to be shifted one column to the right.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: \"Replace all zeros with the digit that is one less than the neighbor digit if neighbor is not zero, otherwise fill with zeros.\" That seems too ad-hoc.\n\nPerhaps we need to look at the differences between input and output in e.g. 1:\n- Input row4: \"23000000000000\"\n- Output row4: \"23223322223333\"\nThe changes: The digits in the first two positions remain the same. Then positions 2-? become a repeating pattern \"22223333\" but not exactly.\n\nLet's look at row5:\n- Input row5: \"11000000000000\"\n- Output row5: \"11111111111111\" (all ones)\nSo row5's non-zero digits are \"11\" in input become \"11111111111111\" in output. But then in row6, it becomes \"00111111111111\", row7: \"00000011111111\", row8: \"00000011111111\". So there is a pattern: the number \"1\" seems to be filling a block that extends from row5 upward to row8 and perhaps is shifted horizontally.\n\nLooking at row1 and row2: They are \"00000022223333\". And row3: \"00223322223333\". Row4: \"23223322223333\". So there is a pattern: the digits \"2\" and \"3\" appear repeatedly. And then row0: \"00000000000000\".\nRow9: all zeros.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Given two rows with two digits each, generate two strokes that extend upward and rightward filling with repeated digits.\" Possibly it's like drawing two lines that join at a point. The numbers themselves might indicate directions: The leftmost digit \"2\" might come from the left stroke of the \"230\" input line, and \"1\" from the \"110\" input line, and then they combine to create a cross shape. But then the digits in the output are not simply sums, but they are repeated in blocks.\n\nMaybe we check differences between e.g. 1 and e.g. 2:\nE.g. 2 Input:\nRows: row4: \"25000000000000\", row5: \"53000000000000\".\nOutput:\nRow1: \"00000022225555\"\nRow2: \"000000222255", "prompt_tokens": 1189, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The transformation rule for ARC examples: They are provided as pairs of input and output grids with some pattern transformation.

Then final test input.\n\nLet's denote each example as a grid with rows.\n\nLet's re-read provided examples and see what transformation rule occurs. We have E.g.1 Input, output:\nE.g.1 Input:\nRow 0: \"0333\"\nRow 1: \"0000\"\nRow 2: \"0000\"\nRow 3: \"0000\"\nRow 4: \"2222\"\nRow 5: \"0000\"\nRow 6: \"0000\"\nRow 7: \"0000\"\nRow 8: \"3300\"\n\nE.g.1 Output:\nRow 0: \"0333\"\nRow 1: \"0400\"\nRow 2: \"0400\"\nRow 3: \"0400\"\nRow 4: \"2222\"\nRow 5: \"0000\"\nRow 6: \"0000\"\nRow 7: \"0000\"\nRow 8: \"3300\"\n\nObservations: In the input, we have digits. The transformation seems to be: The border of the grid remains unchanged. The top row and bottom row remain same. The left column and right column remain same? But then there is a transformation in the middle region. The transformation specifically: The output grid has changed rows 1-3 from \"0000\" to \"0400\". The difference is that the second digit (the one in index 1) changed from 0 to 4? Let's check. In particular, row 1 originally \"0000\", but output becomes \"0400\". That means: the cell at column index 1 becomes 4. Similarly, row 2 becomes \"0400\", row 3 becomes \"0400\". Also, check e.g.1 output row 1: \"0400\" The transformation is: The value becomes 4. But why 4? The digit 0 replaced by 4? But wait, look at e.g.2. E.g.2 input:\nRow0: \"06666\"\nRow1: \"00000\"\nRow2: \"00000\"\nRow3: \"00000\"\nRow4: \"00000\"\nRow5: \"00000\"\nRow6: \"22222\"\nRow7: \"00000\"\nRow8: \"00000\"\nRow9: \"00000\"\nRow10: \"00000\"\nRow11: \"00000\"\nRow12: \"00666\"\nE.g.2 Output:\nRow0: \"06666\"\nRow1: \"00444\"\nRow2: \"00444\"\nRow3: \"00444\"\nRow4: \"00444\"\nRow5: \"00444\"\nRow6: \"22222\"\nRow7: \"00000\"\nRow8: \"00000\"\nRow9: \"00000\"\nRow10: \"00000\"\nRow11: \"00000\"\nRow12: \"00666\"\n\nObservations: The transformation is applied to rows 1 through 5 (the ones in the middle) replaced with \"00444\" instead of \"00000\". But wait, check: Row1 originally \"00000\". In output, row1 becomes \"00444\". That means that the first digit remains 0? Actually, wait, row1 \"00444\" means first digit is 0, then digits 1-4 are \"4444\"? But wait, check: In e.g.2, output row1 is \"00444\", so index 0 remains 0, but indices 1,2,3,4 become 4. But wait, let's check e.g.1: row1 \"0400\" means index 0 is 0, index 1 becomes 4, then indexes 2 and 3 remain 0. But then it's not uniform across columns? Why in e.g.1, row1 becomes \"0400\" instead of \"0044\"? Let's check details: In e.g.1, row1 \"0000\" -> \"0400\". That means only the second digit changed to 4, not all digits? But then in e.g.2, row1 \"00000\" -> \"00444\". That means indices 1-4 changed to 4, but index 0 remains 0. Wait, in e.g.1, why is it \"0400\" and not \"0044\"? Let's check: The grid is 4 columns wide in e.g.1, but in e.g.2 grid is 6 columns wide. So maybe the rule is: The grid, which has a border of some specific digits that remain unchanged, and inside the grid, there's a \"bridge\" shape that gets replaced with a certain number. Let's check e.g.3:\nE.g.3 Input:\nRow0: \"01100\"\nRow1: \"00000\"\nRow2: \"00000\"\nRow3: \"00000\"\nRow4: \"00000\"\nRow5: \"00000\"\nRow6: \"22222\"\nRow7: \"00000\"\nRow8: \"00000\"\nRow9: \"00000\"\nRow10: \"00000\"\nRow11: \"00000\"\nRow12: \"11110\"\nE.g.3 Output:\nRow0: \"01100\"\nRow1: \"00000\"\nRow2: \"00000\"\nRow3: \"00000\"\nRow4: \"00000\"\nRow5: \"00000\"\nRow6: \"22222\"\nRow7: \"04400\"\nRow8: \"04400\"\nRow9: \"04400\"\nRow10: \"04400\"\nRow11: \"04400\"\nRow12: \"11110\"\n\nObservations: In e.g.3, the transformation seems to occur in rows 7 to 11. They become \"04400\". That means: The first digit is 0, second digit becomes 4, then third digit remains 0, fourth digit remains 0? But wait, row \"04400\" means: digit sequence: index0=0, index1=4, index2=4, index3=0, index4=0? Actually \"04400\" is 0,4,4,0,0, but wait, count digits: \"04400\" is 5 digits. But input row \"00000\" is 5 digits, but output row \"04400\" means the second and third digits are 4? But then e.g.2 row1 \"00444\" means: index0=0, indices1-4 are 4. That is inconsistent with e.g.3 row7 \"04400\". Let's re-read e.g.3 output row7: \"04400\". Wait, but the provided e.g.3 output row7 is \"04400\"? Let me re-read the provided text carefully:\n\nE.g. 3 Input:\n01100\n00000\n00000\n00000\n00000\n00000\n22222\n00000\n00000\n00000\n00000\n00000\n11110\n\nE.g. 3 Output:\n01100\n00000\n00000\n00000\n00000\n00000\n22222\n04400\n04400\n04400\n04400\n04400\n11110\n\nSo row7 is \"04400\". That means: The first digit is 0, second digit 4, third digit 4, fourth digit 0, fifth digit 0. But then note that in e.g.2, row1 is \"00444\" which is 0, then 4,4,4,4. So difference: In e.g.2, the replaced block is in the middle rows (1 through 5) and the replaced pattern is \"00444\". In e.g.3, the replaced block is in rows 7 through 11 and the replaced pattern is \"04400\". The difference is the placement of the transformation within the row. In e.g.1, the block is rows 1 through 3 and the pattern is \"0400\". So pattern seems to be: The top row and bottom row remain unchanged. The left and right border of the grid remain unchanged. And then there is a \"cross\" or \"bar\" that is drawn in the inner region. It might be that the transformation rule is to draw a horizontal line (or vertical line?) through the grid connecting the two sets of identical numbers on the border. Let's re-read every example:\n\nE.g.1: \nInput grid: \nRow0: 0333\nRow1: 0000\nRow2: 0000\nRow3: 0000\nRow4: 2222\nRow5: 0000\nRow6: 0000\nRow7: 0000\nRow8: 3300\n\nOutput grid:\nRow0: 0333\nRow1: 0400\nRow2: 0400\nRow3: 0400\nRow4: 2222\nRow5: 0000\nRow6: 0000\nRow7: 0000\nRow8: 3300\n\nObservation: The only change is in rows 1-3. They became \"0400\". What does that represent? Possibly a vertical segment? Consider columns: The grid is 4 columns wide. The top row is \"0333\". The bottom row is \"3300\". In the input, there is a pattern: The top row has 0 at index0, then", "prompt_tokens": 756, "completion_tokens": 2048}

But the problem statement \"ARC problems\" and \"hidden transformation rule\" is common in ARC puzzles. The transformation rule is likely \"simulate some pattern or transformation\" on the grid. We have three examples.\n\nLet's denote these examples with grids. Let's analyze them.\n\nI will denote each row as a string line. However, note that the digits in e.g. examples are not binary, they are multi-digit numbers? Wait, examine Example 1:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n\"5550500055\"\n\"5005505055\"\n\"0550550500\"\n\"2055205025\"\n\"5202020202\"\n\"0025552050\"\n\"5500055555\"\n\"0505505055\"\n\"0550505055\"\n\"5500555555\"\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n\"0000000000\"\n\"0000000000\"\n\"0000000000\"\n\"2000200020\"\n\"5202520252\"\n\"5525552555\"\n\"5555555555\"\n\"5555555555\"\n\"5555555555\"\n\"5555555555\"\n\nObserving pattern: The transformation seems to extract some inner pattern maybe. Possibly it's a \"pattern extraction\" of the border? But how do we get these outputs? Let's compare input and output. Possibly pattern: In output, the top three rows are zeros, then row4 has \"2000200020\". How is that derived from input row4? Let's examine row by row:\n\nExample 1 Input row 1: \"5550500055\"\nOutput row 1: \"0000000000\" i.e. all zeros.\nRow 2 input: \"5005505055\" -> output row 2: \"0000000000\"\nRow 3 input: \"0550550500\" -> output row 3: \"0000000000\"\nRow 4 input: \"2055205025\" -> output row 4: \"2000200020\"\nRow 5 input: \"5202020202\" -> output row 5: \"5202520252\"\nRow 6 input: \"0025552050\" -> output row 6: \"5525552555\"\nRow 7 input: \"5500055555\" -> output row 7: \"5555555555\"\nRow 8 input: \"0505505055\" -> output row 8: \"5555555555\"\nRow 9 input: \"0550505055\" -> output row 9: \"5555555555\"\nRow 10 input: \"5500555555\" -> output row 10: \"5555555555\"\n\nObserving differences: The output is not simply a shift or a rotation of input. Notice that many rows become all zeros in output, and then subsequent rows preserve some pattern from input? Wait, look at row 4: Input row 4: \"2055205025\" becomes \"2000200020\". It seems that maybe the rule is to \"squeeze\" certain digits from the input? How to obtain \"2000200020\" from \"2055205025\"? Possibly by taking the first, third, ... digits? Let's check row 5: Input row 5: \"5202020202\" -> Output row 5: \"5202520252\". Compare digits:\nInput: 5,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2.\nOutput: 5,2,0,2,5,2,0,2,5,2.\nSo it appears that every third digit? Wait, check: positions 1,2,3 in input are 5,2,0, and in output they are 5,2,0. Then position 4 input is 2, but output is 2? Actually, let's align them:\nInput: index: 0:5, 1:2, 2:0, 3:2, 4:0, 5:2, 6:0, 7:2, 8:0, 9:2.\nOutput: index: 0:5, 1:2, 2:0, 3:2, 4:5, 5:2, 6:0, 7:2, 8:5, 9:2.\nSo it looks like at indices 4 and 8, there is a change: originally had 0 become 5? Let's check row 6: Input: \"0025552050\" becomes \"5525552555\". Let's align indices:\nInput row6: 0,0,2,5,5,5,2,0,5,0.\nOutput row6: 5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5.\nSo differences: indices 0: input 0 becomes output 5, index 1: input 0 becomes output 5, index 7: input 0 becomes output 5, index 9: input 0 becomes output 5.\nRow 7: Input: \"5500055555\" becomes \"5555555555\".\nLet's check row 7: input: 5,5,0,0,0,5,5,5,5,5. Output: all 5's. So row 7: changed indices 2,3,4 become 5. Row 8: Input: \"0505505055\" becomes \"5555555555\". Compare: input: 0,5,0,5,5,0,5,0,5,5, output all 5's. Differences: indices 0 changed from 0 to 5, index2 changed from 0 to 5, index5 changed from 0 to 5, index7 changed from 0 to 5.\nRow 9: Input: \"0550505055\" becomes \"5555555555\". Compare: input: 0,5,5,0,5,0,5,0,5,5. Differences: indices 0,3,5,7 become 5. Row 10: Input: \"5500555555\" becomes \"5555555555\". Compare: input: 5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,5,5, differences: indices 2,3 become 5.\n\nWhat's happening? It appears that the transformation rule might be \"fill in the zeros with the nearest non-zero digit from the left or something\" or \"replace zeros with five\"? But then why row 4 becomes \"2000200020\" where zeros remain zeros? Let's re-check row4: \"2055205025\" -> output \"2000200020\". Compare digits: row4 input: 2,0,5,5,2,0,5,0,2,5. Output becomes: 2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,2,0. So in row4, some digits were replaced by 0 where originally they were non-zero? That is odd.\n\nMaybe the rule is \"remove any extraneous digits except ones that are corners of some pattern\"? Let's compare row 5: \"5202020202\" -> output \"5202520252\". It changed some zeros to fives, but row 4 changed some fives to zeros. Row 6: \"0025552050\" -> output \"5525552555\" changed zeros to fives. Row 7: \"5500055555\" -> output \"5555555555\" changed zeros to fives. Row 8,9,10 similarly replaced zeros with fives. But row 4 output is \"2000200020\" which is not all fives but rather alternating 2 and 0. So maybe the rule is not simply replacing zeros with fives. Let's check row5: originally \"5202020202\", changed to \"5202520252\". The digits that changed: at index 4, originally 0 becomes 5, and at index8, originally 0 becomes 5. In row6, indices 0,1,7,9 changed from 0 to 5.\nRow7: indices 2,3,4 become 5.\nRow8: indices 0,2,5,7 become 5.\nRow9: indices 0,3,5,7 become 5.\nRow10: indices 2,3 become 5.\n\nSo what's the pattern? It might be that the output grid is the \"skeleton\" of the input grid, maybe representing the boundaries of clusters of nonzero digits. Possibly it's the \"contour\" of the input pattern. Consider that in the outputs, row4 remains \"2000200020\" which is not all zeros or all fives, but a pattern of 2 and 0. In row 5 output, we see a pattern: 5202520252, where the digits 5 and 2 remain, but some zeros turned into 5. In row 6, output: 5525552555, where the pattern is 5,5,2,5,5,5,2,5,5,5. In rows 7 to 10, output is all 5. So maybe the transformation is like \"thickening\" the lines of ones of the largest connected component? But then input digits are not binary; they are multi-digit numbers. Possibly treat nonzero as \"active\" and zero as \"inactive\". Let's try that: In Example 1, consider input as a binary grid: nonzero digits become 1, zeros become 0. Then Example 1 becomes:\nRow1: 1 1 1 1 0", "prompt_tokens": 771, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Actually, compare: \"011006180081\" and \"011006440081\". \nRow 16: \"188808861860\" vs \"188804461860\". Difference: \"188808861860\" vs \"188804461860\", so difference in the segment \"886\" vs \"446\"? Actually, check carefully: \"188808861860\" vs \"188804461860\". The difference is in the 7th digit? Let's count: \n\"188808861860\"\n\"188804461860\"\nPositions: 1: 1, 2: 8,3: 8,4: 8,5: 0,6: 8,7: 8,8: 6,9: 1,10: 8,11: 6,12: 0 maybe. Let's count exactly: \"188808861860\" has length 12. \nWait, I'll check each row carefully with indices.\n\nI need to look at differences in e.g. 1. Differences occur in rows: row 2, row 3, row 4, row 15, row 16 maybe row 17? Let's check row 17: \"806181668011\" vs \"806184668011\". Yes, row 17: difference: \"806181668011\" vs \"806184668011\". The difference is in the 7th digit? Let's see: \"806181668011\" vs \"806184668011\". The sixth digit \"1\" vs \"4\"? Let's check: Actually, let's count: digits: 8,0,6,1,8,1,6,6,8,0,1,1 versus 8,0,6,1,8,4,6,6,8,0,1,1. So the difference is at position 6: input has 1, output has 4.\n\nAnd row 18: \"808080808081\" vs \"808080808081\": same. Row 19: \"810011088008\" vs \"810011088008\": same.\n\nSo the differences are on rows 2,3,4,15,16,17 maybe. Let's compare those differences more precisely:\n\nRow 2:\nInput: 101186011668\nOutput: 101186011664\nDifference: last two digits: \"11\" vs \"11\"? Let's recalc: Length is 12. Compare digit by digit:\nDigit positions (1-indexed):\n1:1,2:0,3:1,4:1,5:8,6:6,7:0,8:1,9:1,10:1,11:6,12:8? Actually, wait, I'll re-read row 2 input: \"101186011668\". I'll count digits: characters: '1', '0', '1', '1', '8', '6', '0', '1', '1', '1', '6', '8'? Actually that's 12 digits. Output row 2: \"101186011664\". So digits: '1', '0', '1', '1', '8', '6', '0', '1', '1', '1', '6', '4'. So difference is in the last digit: 8 vs 4; but not \"last two digits\"? Actually, the difference is in digit 12: input has 8, output has 4.\n\nRow 3:\nInput: \"018808010610\"\nOutput: \"018808010644\"\nCompare: digits: Both are 12 digits. The difference is at digit 11? Let's check: \"018808010610\" vs \"018808010644\". Compare:\n1:0,2:1,3:8,4:8,5:0,6:8,7:0,8:1,9:0,10:6,11:1,12:0 vs output: 0,1,8,8,0,8,0,1,0,6,4,4.\nSo differences: digit 11: input \"1\" vs output \"4\", digit 12: input \"0\" vs output \"4\".\n\nRow 4:\nInput: \"080800006886\"\nOutput: \"080800006446\"\nCompare: digits: \"080800006886\" vs \"080800006446\". Differences: digit? Let's compare digit by digit:\n0:0,1:8,2:0,3:8,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:6,9:8,10:8,11:6 vs output: 0,8,0,8,0,0,0,0,6,4,4,6. So differences: digit 9: input \"8\" vs output \"4\", digit 10: input \"8\" vs output \"4\", digit 11: input \"6\" vs output \"6\"? Actually, check: In output, digit 11 is \"6\", so only digits 9 and 10 changed from 8 to 4.\n\nRow 15:\nInput: \"011006180081\"\nOutput: \"011006440081\"\nCompare: digits: \"011006180081\" vs \"011006440081\". Differences: digit 7? Let's check: digits:\n1:0,2:1,3:1,4:0,5:0,6:6,7:1,8:8,9:0,10:0,11:8,12:1 vs output: 0,1,1,0,0,6,4,4,0,0,8,1. So differences: digit 7: input \"1\"", "prompt_tokens": 1197, "completion_tokens": 2048}

{"task_id": "7953d61e", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus:free", "raw_response": "We are given ARC-type problems. We have several examples input grids with corresponding outputs. The output is a transformation rule. Our task: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule.\" There are several examples; each example has an input grid of dimension 4x4? Wait check: E.g. 1 Input: \n\"4191\n1914\n9146\n4166\"\nSo that's four rows, each row 4 digits. E.g. 1 Output is:\n\"41911466\n19149146\n91461911\n41664194\n66144914\n64191191\n41916419\n19146641\"\nWait, output grid has 8 rows of 8 columns? Let's check: E.g. 1 output sample: first line \"41911466\" is length 8. second \"19149146\" also length 8, third \"91461911\", fourth \"41664194\", fifth \"66144914\", sixth \"64191191\", seventh \"41916419\", eighth \"19146641\". So transformation from input of size 4x4 to output of size 8x8.\n\nNow E.g.2 Input: \n6262\n6655\n1112\n5121\nOutput:\n62622521\n66556512\n11122611\n51216615\n12155166\n21111162\n55662156\n26261252.\nSo same: input is 4x4, output is 8x8. E.g.3 Input:\n6776\n7166\n9166\n9161\nOutput: \n67766661\n71667666\n91667111\n91616799\n16199976\n66191117\n66176667\n67761666\nAgain 8x8.\nE.g.4 Input:\n4918\n8418\n4881\n1118\nOutput: \n49188818\n84181181\n48819481\n11184841\n81111484\n18841849\n81481811\n81948188\nE.g.5 Input:\n1121\n6676\n7621\n1626\nOutput: \n11211616\n66762722\n76211666\n16261671\n62611761\n12676661\n67662272\n12116161\n\nSo pattern: Given a 4x4 input grid, output is an 8x8 grid. I need to deduce transformation rule.\n\nObserving examples:\n\nLet's index rows and columns. Input grid: 4 rows, each row length 4. Output grid: 8 rows, each row length 8. How transformation rule: Possibly we are placing the input grid in a corner and then doing some \"rotation\" or \"reflection\" of the grid to fill the output. The outputs seem to show the original input grid in the top-left and bottom-right corners? Let's check E.g.1: input: \nRow0: 4 1 9 1\nRow1: 1 9 1 4\nRow2: 9 1 4 6\nRow3: 4 1 6 6\n\nNow output grid E.g.1: top-left 4x4 block? \nRow0: \"4191\" matches input row0 exactly.\nRow1: \"1914\" matches input row1 exactly.\nRow2: \"9146\" matches input row2 exactly.\nRow3: \"4166\" matches input row3 exactly.\n\nThen bottom-left 4x4 block? \nRow4: \"6614\" but input row? Let's check row4: \"6614\" but input row? Not directly matching.\nWait, let's parse output as two halves: top half (rows 0-3) and bottom half (rows 4-7). The top half is exactly the input grid, but extended to 8 columns? Actually top half rows:\nRow0: \"41911466\". The left 4 digits \"4191\" equals input row0. The right 4 digits \"1466\" is different. \nMaybe the rule: The output grid is composed of the input grid placed in four quadrants, plus some rotations/reflections of the input grid. Possibly the rule is: \n- Place the original input in the top-left quadrant.\n- Then place a horizontally flipped version of the input in the top-right quadrant.\n- Then place a vertically flipped version of the input in the bottom-left quadrant.\n- Then place a 180 rotated version in the bottom-right quadrant.\n\nLet's test that on E.g.1. \nOriginal input:\nRow0: 4 1 9 1\nRow1: 1 9 1 4\nRow2: 9 1 4 6\nRow3: 4 1 6 6\n\nNow top-left quadrant: original input as is:\nRow0: 4 1 9 1\nRow1: 1 9 1 4\nRow2: 9 1 4 6\nRow3: 4 1 6 6\n\nTop-right quadrant: horizontally flipped version of input. That means reverse each row.\nRow0: reversed row0 becomes: 1 9 1 4. So top-right block row0 would be \"1914\".\nRow1: reversed row1 becomes: 4 1 9 1 -> \"4191\"\nRow2: reversed row2 becomes: 6 4 1 9 -> \"6419\"? Wait let me recalc: row2: \"9 1 4 6\", reversed gives \"6 4 1 9\".\nRow3: reversed row3 becomes: \"6 6 1 4\". \n\nNow bottom-left quadrant: vertically flipped version of input, i.e. reverse the order of rows.\nSo bottom-left block:\nThe bottom-left block's rows are input rows in reverse order:\nRow0 (bottom block row0) gets input last row reversed? Wait, careful: if we are placing quadrants, then:\n- Top-left quadrant: rows 0-3, columns 0-3 = original input.\n- Top-right quadrant: rows 0-3, columns 4-7 = horizontally flipped input.\n- Bottom-left quadrant: rows 4-7, columns 0-3 = vertically flipped input.\n- Bottom-right quadrant: rows 4-7, columns 4-7 = 180 rotated input (which is same as horizontally flipping vertically flipped input, equivalently).\n\nLet's check using E.g.1:\nTop-left quadrant (same as input):\nRow0: 4 1 9 1\nRow1: 1 9 1 4\nRow2: 9 1 4 6\nRow3: 4 1 6 6\n\nTop-right quadrant (horizontal flip):\nRow0: 1 9 1 4\nRow1: 4 1 9 1\nRow2: 6 4 1 9\nRow3: 6 6 1 4\n\nBottom-left quadrant (vertical flip):\nTake input rows in reverse order:\nRow0 of bottom-left block becomes input row3: 4 1 6 6.\nRow1 becomes input row2: 9 1 4 6.\nRow2 becomes input row1: 1 9 1 4.\nRow3 becomes input row0: 4 1 9 1.\n\nBottom-right quadrant (180 rotated, which is vertical flip then horizontal flip, or equivalently, horizontal flip of bottom-left quadrant):\nRow0 of bottom-right block becomes horizontal flip of row0 of bottom-left: horizontal flip of \"4666\" gives \"66 6 4\"? Let's do: row0 bottom-left is \"4 1 6 6\", reversed to \"6 6 1 4\".\nRow1: bottom-left row1 is \"9 1 4 6\", reversed to \"6 4 1 9\".\nRow2: bottom-left row2 is \"1 9 1 4\", reversed to \"4 1 9 1\".\nRow3: bottom-left row3 is \"4 1 9 1\", reversed to \"1 9 1 4\".\n\nNow let's reconstruct full output grid row by row:\nRow0: top-left row0 + top-right row0 = \"4191\" + \"1914\" = \"41911914\". But expected E.g.1 output row0 is \"41911466\". They differ in the second half: expected \"1466\" but we got \"1914\". So my guess with quadrant splitting doesn't match.\n\nLet's re-check the given output for E.g.1:\nRow0: \"41911466\"\nRow1: \"19149146\"\nRow2: \"91461911\"\nRow3: \"41664194\"\nRow4: \"66144914\"\nRow5: \"64191191\"\nRow6: \"41916419\"\nRow7: \"19146641\"\n\nMaybe the transformation is: The output grid is composed of the input grid, then a rotation 90 degrees of the input appended? Let's check E.g.1: maybe the rule is: \nTake the input grid, then rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, then append that rotated grid below the original? But then output would be 8x4, not 8x8.\nMaybe the rule is: \nThe output grid is a 180-degree rotation of the input grid placed in the top half and the input grid placed in the bottom half, but then columns are concatenated? Let's try to see pattern: \nLook at row0 output: \"41911466\". Split into two halves: \"4191\" and \"1466\". Compare with input row0: \"4191\". Then second", "prompt_tokens": 681, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Actually, the ARC tasks are usually one puzzle per example. Possibly the examples are from different ARC tasks. But then the final test input grid is provided. But then the examples \"E.g. 1\", \"E.g. 2\", etc. are separate examples, not one and the same transformation rule.\n\nWait, but the prompt says: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples\" and \"determine the transformation rule.\" So there must be a single transformation rule that applies across all examples?

Actually, let's count digits in first line: \"00080800080800000000\" length: count digits: \"00080800080800000000\" count: 0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0? Wait, count properly: \"00080800080800000000\" length: group them: \"000\" (3) then \"808\" (3) then \"000\" (3) then \"808\" (3) then \"0000000000\" (10)? Actually, wait no. Let's count: I'll count characters manually:\n\"00080800080800000000\"\nIndex: \n1:0\n2:0\n3:0\n4:8\n5:0\n6:8\n7:0\n8:0\n9:0\n10:8\n11:0\n12:0\n13:0\n14:0\n15:0\n16:0\n17:0\n18:0\n19:0\n20:0? Actually need to check. Let's count: \n\"000\" (indexes 1-3) then \"808\" (4-6) then \"000\" (7-9) then \"808\" (10-12) then \"0000000000\" (13-22) so total length 22? But given string \"00080800080800000000\" length: It might be 20 digits if we check \"00080800080800000000\" has 20 digits? Let's count manually: \nCharacters: \n0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0? Actually length is ambiguous. Let me count: I'll count groups:\n\"000\" (3), \"808\" (3) -> total 6, \"000\" (3) -> total 9, \"808\" (3) -> total 12, \"0000000000\" (10) -> total 22. So that would be 22 characters. But then the second line: \"80000008000000000808\" if we count similarly might be 22 as well. But then later lines, maybe it's 22 columns? But then \"E.g. 2\" has each line length \"0050000000\" is 10 digits. \"E.g. 3\" has 6 digits per line. \"E.g. 4\" has 6 digits per line. \"E.g. 5\" has lines of length 13 maybe? \"5000005000000\" is 13 digits? \"E.g. 6\" has lines of length 7 digits.\nSo these are different puzzles from ARC tasks. But the task description says \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule.\" So it's ambiguous: Are these examples from different puzzles? Possibly the transformation rule is different for each example? Yet then \"Test Input\" is given. Which one does it correspond to? The test input is a grid with many lines, I count lines: The test input is the grid given after \"Test Input:\" (the long grid). It seems to be a grid of some dimension.

Wait, let's check E.g. 1: It might be 22 columns because row has \"00080800080800000000\". Count: 3+3+3+3+10=22.

We are provided three examples: E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3. These examples are transformation examples from input grid to output grid. They are represented as 10x10 grids? Actually let\u2019s count each row: Each example has 10 rows as strings. Actually the first string \"1515525551\" is length 10. And the output also 10 rows. So these are 10x10 puzzles.\n\nWe are given three examples with corresponding transformation from input grid to output grid. And then a test input grid is provided, and we need to apply the hidden transformation rule to produce the test output grid.\n\nWe need to deduce the rule from the examples. Let's try to analyze the examples. They are textual grids with digits like 0,1,2,5 maybe. Let's list them in matrix form.\n\nLet's denote rows as strings of digits. The digits in the grid appear to be from the set {0,1,2,5?} Actually in e.g. 1, we see digits: 1,5 at corners. In e.g. 2, we see digits: 2,5? Actually, check details:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nRow0: 1515525551\nRow1: 0005000500\nRow2: 0005000200\nRow3: 0005000500\nRow4: 5255555525\nRow5: 0005000500\nRow6: 0001000500\nRow7: 0005000500\nRow8: 0005000500\nRow9: 5255551552\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nRow0: 1515525551\nRow1: 1115222522\nRow2: 1115222222\nRow3: 1115222522\nRow4: 5255555525\nRow5: 2225111522\nRow6: 2221111522\nRow7: 2225111522\nRow8: 2225111522\nRow9: 5255551552\n\nObservations: The transformation seems to affect rows 1-8? Let's check row0 and row9. In e.g. 1, row0 and row9 remain the same. Similarly in e.g. 2, row0 and row9 remain the same? Let's check e.g. 2.\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\nRow0: 2555155552\nRow1: 0050000500\nRow2: 0010000100\nRow3: 0050000500\nRow4: 0050000500\nRow5: 5155525551\nRow6: 0050000200\nRow7: 0050000500\nRow8: 1555255551\nE.g. 2 Output:\nRow0: 2555155552 (unchanged)\nRow1: 1151111511\nRow2: 1111111111\nRow3: 1151111511\nRow4: 1151111511\nRow5: 5155525551 (unchanged)\nRow6: 1152222511\nRow7: 1152222211\nRow8: 1152222511\nRow9: 1555255551 (unchanged)\n\nWait, row9? Actually, e.g. 2 input had 10 rows: row indices 0 to 9. But in e.g. 2, row9 is \"1555255551\". And output row9 is \"1555255551\" unchanged. So pattern: border rows (first and last row) remain unchanged. Similarly e.g. 3: Row0 and row9 remain unchanged.\n\nSo transformation is applied only to some interior rows maybe. But in e.g. 3, row0 and row9 remain same.\n\nObserving rows that changed:\nIn e.g. 1: Rows 1,2,3,5,6,7,8 are changed. Row4 remains same. In e.g. 2: Rows 1,2,3,4,6,7,8 changed; row0, row5, row9 remain same. In e.g. 3: Row0 and row9 remain same; rows 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 changed.\n\nSo which rows are transformed? Possibly the rule is that we fill some pattern in the interior of the grid that may have some offsets. But also note that e.g. 1: Row0 and row9 unchanged, row4 unchanged. So pattern: maybe rows that are \"center\" rows (like rows that are not border rows) are transformed by some rule that involves the digits \"0\", \"5\", \"1\"? But then e.g. 2 and e.g. 3, row4 changed in e.g. 3. Let's check e.g. 3: \nInput e.g. 3: \nRow0: 1525255551\nRow1: 0005002000\nRow2: 0005005000\nRow3: 5255515525\nRow4: 0005002000\nRow5: 0001005000\nRow6: 2255155515\nRow7: 0005001000\nRow8: 0005005000\nRow9: 5515515525\nOutput e.g. 3:\nRow0: 1525255551 (unchanged)\nRow1: 2225222222\nRow2: 2225225222\nRow3: 5255515525 (unchanged)\nRow4: 2225112222\nRow5: 2221115222\nRow6: 2255155515 (unchanged)\nRow7: 2225111111\nRow8: 2225115111\nRow9: 5515515525 (unchanged)\n\nSo in e.g. 3, rows 0 and 3 and 6 and 9 remain unchanged. So pattern: maybe the transformation is applied except for rows that are multiples of 3? Let's check e.g. 1: rows that are unchanged: row0 and row4 and row9. In e.g. 2: rows that are unchanged: row0, row5, row9. In e.g. 3: rows that are unchanged: row0, row3, row6, row9.\n\nSo the transformation rule might depend on row index parity? Possibly if row index is 0 or last row, they remain unchanged. And then for other rows, the transformation might be to replace some digits by 1 or 2. But what's the pattern in the transformation? Let's compare input and output row by row for e.g. 1.\n\nFor e.g. 1, let's denote rows indices:\nRow0: Input: 1515525551, Output: same.\nRow1: Input: 0005000500, Output: 1115222522.\nRow2: Input: 0005000200, Output: 1115222222.\nRow3: Input: 0005000500, Output: 1115222522.\nRow4: Input: 5255555525, Output: same.\nRow5: Input: 0005000500, Output: 2225111522.\nRow6: Input: 0001000500, Output: 2221111522.\nRow7: Input: 0005000500, Output: 2225111522.\nRow8: Input: 0005000500, Output: 2225111522.\nRow9: Input: 5255551552, Output: same.\n\nLook at row1 transformation:\nInput row1: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0.\nOutput row1: 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2.\nMapping: The 0's become 1's except in some positions? Let's check: In row1, positions: index0:0->1, index1:0->1, index2:0->1, index3:5->5 unchanged, index4:0->2, index5:0->2, index6:0->2, index7:5->5, index8:0->2, index9:0->2.\nRow2: Input row2: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0.\nOutput row2: 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2.\nMapping: indices 0,1,2 changed from 0 to 1, index3: 5 stays, index4,5,6: 0->2, index7: 2 becomes 2? Actually, input index7 is 2 becomes output index7 is 2? Actually check row2: input: \"0005000200\", output: \"1115222222\". So index3: '5' remains, index7: '0'? Wait re-read row2: \"0005000200\": digits: index0=0,1=0,2=0, index3=5, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0, index7=2, index8=0, index9=0.\nWait, let's recalc:\nRow2 input: \"0005000200\": digits: \nindex0:0, index1:0, index2:0, index3:5, index4:0, index5:0, index6:0,", "prompt_tokens": 771, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The first example details E.g. 1 Input and Output, second example E.g. 2 Input and Output, third example E.g. 3 Input and Output, then the Test Input.\n\nWe are asked: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\"\n\nWe need to output the transformation rule reasoning in less than 5 steps and then output the final test grid as JSON list of lists.\n\nWe are given examples in text form, we must decode the pattern transformation from input grid to output grid.\n\nWe need to read the examples carefully. Let's re-read the examples:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n1111111111111111\n1000011111111111\n1000011111000011\n1000011111330011\n1022011111330011\n1111111111000011\n1111111111111111\n1111111111111111\n1111111111111111\n1111111111111111\n1111144441111111\n1111100001111111\n1111100001111111\n1111100001111111\n1111111111111111\n1111111111111111\n\nOutput:\n4444\n3300\n3300\n0220\n\nObservations: The output grid is much smaller (4 rows x 4 columns). The input grid is 16 rows x 16 columns. But the output is only a 4x4. So maybe the transformation is to extract a subgrid. But then the numbers in output: row1: \"4444\", row2: \"3300\", row3: \"3300\", row4: \"0220\". The input numbers in the top left? Let's examine pattern: The input grid's border is mostly 1's. There are some other digits inside: 0, 3, 4, etc. But the output includes digits 4,3,0,2. Wait digits: 4,3,0,2. But the input digits: There are digits 1,0,3,4,2. Possibly the rule is to extract some contiguous shape's border or something. Let's check positions.\n\nMaybe we are supposed to find squares of different colors? We see in the input, there is a shape with different colors? For example, in E.g. 1, there's a region of 1's with a \"hole\" and others. But the output is 4x4 matrix. It might be that the output grid is the result of a \"bounding box\" transformation from the input. The transformation might be: \"Given the input grid, find the smallest rectangle that encloses all non-1 cells, then re-map the 1's to something else?\" Alternatively, maybe the rule is \"Replace each 1 in the input with the color of the adjacent cell?\" Let's re-read the examples.\n\nLet me re-read E.g. 1 Input grid: The grid is 16x16. The output is 4x4. It might be that the transformation is to extract a \"subproblem\" that is rotated or scaled? The output digits: row1: \"4444\" -> all 4's, row2: \"3300\", row3: \"3300\", row4: \"0220\". Perhaps the transformation is a kind of \"pattern extraction\" that takes a specific region inside the input grid. For instance, if I look at the input grid, there are clusters of 0's, 3's, 4's, and 2's. Maybe the output is like a \"minimap\" of the input grid. But then why is the output size 4x4? Possibly because the input grid has a \"pattern\" that is repeated? Alternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the differences between adjacent rows? \nI must try to find some pattern from the examples.\n\nLet's inspect E.g. 1 Input. I'll denote rows with indices 0 to 15. We see:\nRow0: 1111111111111111 (all 1)\nRow1: 1000011111111111\nRow2: 1000011111000011\nRow3: 1000011111330011\nRow4: 1022011111330011\nRow5: 1111111111000011\nRow6: 1111111111111111\nRow7: 1111111111111111\nRow8: 1111111111111111\nRow9: 1111111111111111\nRow10: 1111144441111111\nRow11: 1111100001111111\nRow12: 1111100001111111\nRow13: 1111100001111111\nRow14: 1111111111111111\nRow15: 1111111111111111\n\nI need to find region boundaries. Notice that the output is 4x4. Possibly the transformation is to identify a \"connected component\" of non-1 digits, then take its bounding box, and then map each of the digits in that bounding box to a new pattern? Or perhaps the transformation is: \"Take the input grid, apply a flood fill on the border cells (which are 1's) to remove them, and then compress the remaining matrix to a dense form.\"\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is: \"Find the minimal rectangle that contains all cells that are not equal to the background value (which might be 1), then crop the input to that rectangle, and then subtract 1 from each cell?\" But then the output for E.g. 1 would be: If we crop the input to the bounding box of non-1 digits? Let's check: The non-1 digits are: in row1, there's a 0 at col4? Actually row1: \"1000011111111111\", so the first digit is 1, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 0, then 1,... Actually, let me parse row1: It starts with \"1\", then \"0000\", then \"1\", then \"11111111\". So the non-1 digits in row1 are at columns 1-4? But they are zeros.\nRow2: \"1000011111000011\": digits: 1, then 0000, then 11111, then 10000, then 11. So non-1 digits here are zeros in positions 1-4 and maybe something in positions 10-13? Actually let's count: row2: index0=1, index1=0, index2=0, index3=0, index4=0, then index5=1, index6=1, index7=1, index8=1, index9=1, then index10=1? Wait, let me re-read row2 carefully: It is \"1000011111000011\". Count characters: positions:\n0:1\n1:0\n2:0\n3:0\n4:0\n5:1\n6:1\n7:1\n8:1\n9:1\n10:1? Actually I'll number: \"1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\". So digits at indices 1-4 are 0, and indices 10-13 are 0, but index5-9 are 1's? Wait, check: row2: \"1000011111000011\" length 16.\nIndices:\n0: '1'\n1: '0'\n2: '0'\n3: '0'\n4: '0'\n5: '1'\n6: '1'\n7: '1'\n8: '1'\n9: '1'\n10: '1'? Let's re-read: \"1000011111000011\". It might be: \"1 0001 1111 0001 1\"? That splits as: \"1\", \"0001\", \"1111\", \"0001\", \"1\"? That would be 1+4+4+4+1 = 14, not 16.\nMaybe I should count manually: I'll count characters: \nRow2: \"1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\"? That would be 16 if it starts and ends with 1. Let's try grouping: Possibly it's \"1 0001 1111 0001 1\" but that sums to 1+4+4+4+1 = 14, not 16. Alternatively, maybe it's \"1000011111000011\" = \"1 0000 1111 1000011\"? Not sure.\nI need to re-read the provided examples carefully. Possibly the best approach: The outputs are smaller grids than the inputs. They might be a sort of \"box drawing\" of the input shape.\n\nMaybe the rule is: Given an input grid, the output grid is a 2x2 or 4x4 grid that represents the connectivity of the shapes. The numbers in output: 4,3,0,2. They could correspond to counts of something. Perhaps the rule is to count the number of each digit in certain positions relative to the border? For instance, in e.g. 1, the output row1 is all 4's. Row2 is \"3300\". Row3 is \"3300\". Row", "prompt_tokens": 902, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The prompt states: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" The provided examples are three sets of input and output pairs, then final test grid.\n\nWe have three examples with detailed input and output grids. They are not trivial but likely transformation rules. The final test is similar to the examples. I need to deduce the transformation rule from examples. Let's analyze the examples one by one.\n\nThe example 1:\nInput:\nLine 1: \"0000000220000\"\nLine 2: \"0000000202000\"\nLine 3: \"0004000020000\"\nLine 4: \"0044400000000\"\nLine 5: \"0004000000000\"\nLine 6: \"0000000000000\"\nLine 7: \"0000000030300\"\nLine 8: \"0000000033000\"\nLine 9: \"0000000003000\"\nLine 10: \"0000000000000\"\nLine 11: \"1111111000000\"\nLine 12: \"1411181000000\"\nLine 13: \"1111111000800\"\nLine 14: \"1111111008080\"\nLine 15: \"1111111000800\"\nLine 16: \"1311121000000\"\nLine 17: \"1111111000000\"\n\nOutput:\nLine 1: \"0400080\"\nLine 2: \"4440808\"\nLine 3: \"0400080\"\nLine 4: \"0000000\"\nLine 5: \"3030220\"\nLine 6: \"3300202\"\nLine 7: \"0300020\"\n\nWait, I see a pattern: The output grid is a 7x7 maybe? Actually let's count:\n\nThe provided input for example 1: It is 17 lines each of length 13? But output from example 1 is 7 lines of 7 digits? Let's check: Output \"0400080\" length 7. \"4440808\" length 7. \"0400080\", \"0000000\", \"3030220\", \"3300202\", \"0300020\". So there are 7 lines, which is half of 14? Possibly the output grid is the result of a transformation that compresses the input grid. Perhaps the transformation rule is something like \"take the non-zero elements from the input and map them to a new grid\"? Possibly the transformation involves some sort of \"diagonal reflection\" or \"mirroring\" transformation.\n\nI need to check pattern in each example.\n\nLet's re-read instructions: \"The user will provide several pairs of example input grids and their corresponding output grids. They represent a hidden transformation rule.\" Then the final test input grid is provided. We have three examples. So likely they are from ARC tasks.\n\nMaybe the transformation is: \"For each non-zero cell in the input, reflect its position to some output grid based on some pattern.\" Possibly the rule is \"find all cells with a value that is not 0 in the input grid, and then place them in the output grid in positions that are mirror images of some reference point.\"\n\nWait, let me try to compare the coordinates. For example 1: input grid dimensions? They are 17 lines, each 13 columns? But the output grid is 7 lines, each 7 columns. That is exactly half the dimensions? Let's check: 17 input lines, output 7 lines. 13 input columns, output 7 columns. Possibly the rule is to take the \"center\" of the grid and then reflect the pattern along the diagonal? But then the output is much smaller.\n\nMaybe the rule is \"extract the bounding box of nonzero digits\" from the input grid, and then transform it by some reflection or rotation. Let's check the input rows for example 1: It seems non-zero digits appear in specific rows: rows 1-10 are non-zero? Actually, let's check: row1 \"0000000220000\" has nonzero digits at positions 7,8? There's \"22\". Row2 \"0000000202000\" has nonzero \"202\" I see \"20\" and then \"200\"? Not sure.\n\nLet's re-read the given lines with coordinates: I'll index rows from 0 to 16, columns 0 to 12.\n\nRow 0: \"0000000220000\". Nonzero digits at positions? \"22\" at columns 6 and 7 maybe?\nRow 1: \"0000000202000\". Nonzero at columns? \"202\" at columns 6,7,8? Actually \"0202000\", so maybe columns 6=0, 7=2, 8=0, 9=2, 10=0, 11=0? Actually need to align indices.\n\nI must re-read carefully: The input strings are given as:\n\nExample 1 Input (I'll denote each as a row, index i, and count digits):\nRow0: \"0000000220000\" (13 digits)\nRow1: \"0000000202000\"\nRow2: \"0004000020000\"\nRow3: \"0044400000000\"\nRow4: \"0004000000000\"\nRow5: \"0000000000000\"\nRow6: \"0000000030300\"\nRow7: \"0000000033000\"\nRow8: \"0000000003000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000000\"\nRow10: \"1111111000000\"\nRow11: \"1411181000000\"\nRow12: \"1111111000800\"\nRow13: \"1111111008080\"\nRow14: \"1111111000800\"\nRow15: \"1311121000000\"\nRow16: \"1111111000000\"\n\nOutput for Example 1:\nRow0: \"0400080\"\nRow1: \"4440808\"\nRow2: \"0400080\"\nRow3: \"0000000\"\nRow4: \"3030220\"\nRow5: \"3300202\"\nRow6: \"0300020\"\n\nThe output grid is 7 rows x 7 columns. Possibly the rule is to take the center 7x7 square of the input grid? But the input grid is 17x13, which center would be roughly rows 5 to 11 (7 rows) and columns 3 to 9 (7 columns)? Let's check: If we take rows 5 to 11 (i.e., indices 5,6,7,8,9,10,11) and columns 3 to 9 (indices 3,4,5,6,7,8,9), what do we get?\n\nLet's extract that from example 1 input:\nWe need rows 5 to 11 and columns 3 to 9. Row indices:\nRow 5: \"0000000000000\", columns 3-9: \"0000000\". That matches output row 3 maybe? But output row 3 is \"0000000\". But then row 6: \"0000000030300\", columns 3-9: positions: index 3: \"0\",4:\"0\",5:\"0\",6:\"0\",7:\"0\",8:\"0\",9:\"3\"? Wait, let's recalc carefully:\n\nFor row 5: \"0000000000000\": columns 3-9: indices 3,4,5,6,7,8,9 are \"0000000\". That equals output row3? But output row3 is \"0000000\". But then row 6: \"0000000030300\": columns 3-9: indices: \n- col3: char at index 3: \"0\"\n- col4: index 4: \"0\"\n- col5: index 5: \"0\"\n- col6: index 6: \"0\"\n- col7: index 7: \"0\"\n- col8: index 8: \"0\"\n- col9: index 9: \"3\"\nSo that yields \"0000003\", but output row? Actually, output row? Possibly output row order might be different. Let's try re-index: The output grid has 7 rows. Which rows correspond to which input rows? Perhaps the transformation is: Output[i][j] = input[?] maybe reversed order vertically.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Take the central 7x7 square of the input grid and flip it vertically\" or \"rotate 90 degrees\" or something.\n\nLet's try to see: The center of 17x13 is roughly row index 8 (center row) and column index 6 (center col). The 7x7 square centered at (8,6) would have top-left corner at (8-3, 6-3) = (5,3) and bottom-right corner at (5+7-1, 3+7-1) = (11,9). So rows 5 to 11 and columns 3 to 9. Let's extract that:\n\nFor example 1, rows 5 to 11, columns 3 to 9:\nRow5: \"0000000000000\" -> columns 3-9: \"0000000\"\nRow6: \"0000000030300\" -> columns 3-9: indices 3 to 9: \"0000003\"? Let's recalc row6: \"0000000030300\": digits: index0=0,1=0,2=0,3=0,4=0,5=0,6=0,7=0,8=0", "prompt_tokens": 964, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Actually count columns: row1: \"000000000000000000000000000\" count digits: maybe length 24? Actually let's count: The string \"000000000000000000000000000\" is 24 zeros. Yes.\n\nSo grid dimensions: 23? Check: Actually count rows: There are 23 lines in E.g. 1? Let's count: from the text it seems there are 23 lines. Actually I'll count manually:\nLine 1: \"000000000000000000000000000\"\nLine 2: \"088888888888888000000000000\"\nLine 3: \"080000000000008000000000000\"\nLine 4: \"080444444000008000000000000\"\nLine 5: \"080400004000008000000000000\"\nLine 6: \"080403304022208000777777777\"\nLine 7: \"080400004020208000700000007\"\nLine 8: \"080400004020208000700000007\"\nLine 9: \"080444444020208000701111107\"\nLine 10: \"080000000022208000701000107\"\nLine 11: \"080000000000008000701000107\"\nLine 12: \"088888888888888000701000107\"\nLine 13: \"000000000000000000701000107\"\nLine 14: \"000000000000000000701000107\"\nLine 15: \"000444444444440000701000107\"\nLine 16: \"000400000000040000701000107\"\nLine 17: \"000400000000040000701000107\"\nLine 18: \"000400000000040000701111107\"\nLine 19: \"000400000000040000700000007\"\nLine 20: \"000400000000040000700000007\"\nLine 21: \"000444444444440000777777777\"\nLine 22: \"000000000000000000000000000\"\nLine 23: \"000000000000000000000000000\"\n\nThat is 23 lines. But then E.g. 2 and E.g. 3 have a certain number of lines. Let me re-read the provided examples. They are typical ARC problems. The grids are transformation puzzles where the output is a version of the input grid with some parts replaced. There are patterns. We need to deduce the transformation rule.\n\nObserving E.g. 1: Compare input and output row by row.\n\nI suspect the transformation rule involves coloring cells or drawing borders around a region. Let\u2019s inspect changes in E.g. 1.\n\nRow by row for E.g. 1:\nInput Row1: \"000000000000000000000000000\"\nOutput Row1: \"000000000000000000000000000\"\nNo change. So border row unaffected.\n\nRow2 input: \"088888888888888000000000000\"\nOutput row2: \"088888888888888000000000000\"\nAlso no change. So the top border rows remain same.\n\nRow3 input: \"080000000000008000000000000\"\nOutput row3: \"080000000000008000000000000\"\nNo change.\n\nRow4 input: \"080444444000008000000000000\"\nOutput row4: \"080888888000008000000000000\"\nDifference: The segment \"444444\" becomes \"888888\". So maybe the transformation replaced 4's with 8's in that region.\nRow5 input: \"080400004000008000000000000\"\nOutput row5: \"080800008000008000000000000\"\nDifference: \"400004\" becomes \"800008\"? Actually check: \"080400004000008000000000000\" vs \"080800008000008000000000000\": Let's compare segments: The segment in the middle \"400004000\" becomes \"800008000\". So maybe rule: In some region, change digits from 0 to something? Let's check further.\n\nRow6 input: \"080403304022208000777777777\"\nOutput row6: \"080808808088808000777777777\"\nDifference: The first segment: \"080403304022208\" becomes \"", "prompt_tokens": 1852, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The input and output have same outer border rows? Look at first row: \"0000000000000000000\" remains unchanged in both input and output. Similarly last row remains unchanged.\n- The digits in the first row are zeros.\n- Look at second row input: \"0880880880880880880\" becomes \"0440440880440440880\" in output. So how do we transform? There's replacement of \"8\" with \"4\" in some positions maybe.\n- A pattern: In output, some segments \"0880880880880880880\" become \"0440440880440440880\". That suggests that some 8's become 4's.\n- Let's compare columns: The digits in positions that correspond to 8 become 4 sometimes. But note that in some rows the digits remain same.\n- Let's check row 2: input: 0880880880880880880, output: 0440440880440440880. Differences: positions 0: input: 0, output:0; position 1: input:8, output:4; position2: input:8, output:4; position3: input:0, output:0; position4: input:8, output:4; position5: input:8, output:4; position6: input:0, output:0; position7: input:8, output:4; position8: input:8, output:4; position9: input:0, output:0; position10: input:8, output:4; position11: input:8, output:4; position12: input:8, output:4; position13: input:0, output:0; position14: input:8, output:4; position15: input:8, output:4; position16: input:8, output:4; position17: input:0, output:0; position18: input:8, output:4; position19: input:8, output:8?

Let indices 0 to 19.\nRow2 input: \"0880880880880880880\".\nWe want to check digit by digit.\n- index 0: input '0', output '0'\n- index 1: input '8', output '4'\n- index 2: input '8', output '4'\n- index 3: input '0', output '0'\n- index 4: input '8', output '4'\n- index 5: input '8', output '4'\n- index 6: input '0', output '0'\n- index 7: input '8', output '4'\n- index 8: input '8', output '4'\n- index 9: input '0', output '0'\n- index 10: input '8', output '4'\n- index 11: input '8', output '4'\n- index 12: input '8', output '4'\n- index 13: input '0', output '0'\n- index 14: input '8', output '4'\n- index 15: input '8', output '4'\n- index 16: input '8', output '4'\n- index 17: input '0', output '0'\n- index 18: input '8', output '4'\n- index 19: input '0', output '0'? Wait, check the provided output row: \"0440440880440440880\" has 20 digits. Let me align them:\nRow2 input: \"0880880880880880880\"\nRow2 output: \"0440440880440440880\"\nSo comparing index by index:\nIndices: 0: 0 vs 0\n1: 8 vs 4\n2: 8 vs 4\n3: 0 vs 0\n4: 8 vs 4\n5: 8 vs 4\n6: 0 vs 0\n7: 8 vs 4\n8: 8 vs 4\n9: 0 vs 0\n10: 8 vs 4\n11: 8 vs 4\n12: 8 vs 4?

Let's try splitting: The length is 20, so 10 pairs: 08, 80, 88, 08, 80, 88, 08, 80, 88, 08 (but last pair \"08\" gives \"08\", but then there is an extra \"80\"? Actually, let me re-read the string carefully:\n\"0880880880880880880\"\nCount digits: digits: 0,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,0? I'm trying to count: \"0880880880880880880\"\nLet me count manually: \nDigit positions:\n0: '0'\n1: '8'\n2: '8'\n3: '0'\n4: '8'\n5: '8'\n6: '0'\n7: '8'\n8: '8'\n9: '0'\n10: '8'\n11: '8'\n12: '0'\n13: '8'\n14: '8'\n15: '0'\n16: '8'\n17: '8'\n18: '0'\n19: '0'? Wait, but the string ends with 80? I need to re-read the given string carefully. The provided example:\nE.g. 1 Input:\n0000000000000000000\n0880880880880880880\n0880800880080880880\n0880880080880880080\n0880880880800880880\n...\nWait, let me count second row carefully:\nIt is: \"0880880880880880880\". Counting digits manually: \n\"0\" (1), \"8\" (2), \"8\" (3), \"0\" (4), \"8\" (5), \"8\" (6), \"0\" (7), \"8\" (8), \"8\" (9), \"0\" (10), \"8\" (11), \"8\" (12), \"0\" (13), \"8\" (14), \"8\" (15), \"0\" (16), \"8\" (17), \"8\" (18), \"0\" (19). So length 19? But then \"0880880880880880880\" if I count digits: \nI'll count manually: \n\"0\" then \"8\" then \"8\" then \"0\" then \"8\" then \"8\" then \"0\" then \"8\" then \"8\" then \"0\" then \"8\" then \"8\" then \"0\" then \"8\" then \"8\" then \"0\" then \"8\" then \"8\" then \"0\". That gives 19 digits? Actually, count: \nIndices: 0:0, 1:8, 2:8, 3:0, 4:8, 5:8, 6:0, 7:8, 8:8, 9:0, 10:8, 11:8, 12:0, 13:8, 14:8, 15:0,", "prompt_tokens": 1293, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The examples are ARC tasks with a hidden transformation rule. The input and outputs are grids of characters? Actually given: The examples are strings of digits, but each string is a row representation? Let's re-read carefully.\n\nWe are given three pairs of examples. They are described as e.g. 1, e.g. 2, e.g. 3. They are not exactly \"grids\", but lines of digits with no spaces. But we see pattern like for e.g. 1: Input and Output. Let me re-read:\n\nE.g. 1 Input (12 lines apparently) each line is 12 characters. But check: Actually the sample e.g. 1 input is:\n\"800800088080\" (12 characters) \n\"808000800800\" (12 characters) \n\"000808888808\" (12 characters) \n\"080800808800\" (12 characters) \n\"800800088800\" (12 characters) \n\"880808888880\" (12 characters) \n\"080008080880\" (12 characters) \n\"088880080088\" (12 characters) \n\"080888800880\" (12 characters) \n\"088880008008\" (12 characters) \n\"808000008800\" (12 characters) \n\"080808080080\" (12 characters)\n\nAnd e.g. 1 output is:\n\"800830088080\"\n\"808333800800\"\n\"000838888808\"\n\"080800808800\"\n\"800800088800\"\n\"880808888880\"\n\"080008080880\"\n\"088880080088\"\n\"080888800880\"\n\"088880308008\"\n\"808003338800\"\n\"080808380080\"\n\nObserving differences:\nComparing input and output for e.g. 1, we see changes where digits '8' become '8' or sometimes become something else? Let's compare line by line.\n\nLine1: Input: \"800800088080\", Output: \"800830088080\".\nDifference: The substring \"0\" changed to \"3\" at index? Let's check: \"800800088080\" vs \"800830088080\". At position 6 perhaps? Let's index positions: (counting from 0)\n0:8 vs 0:8, \n1:0 vs 1:0,\n2:0 vs 2:0,\n3:8 vs 3:8,\n4:0 vs 4:0,\n5:0 vs 5:0,\n6:0 vs 6:3, so the 7th digit changed from 0 to 3.\nThen rest: \"088080\" vs \"088080\".

Difference: Let's check: \n\"808000800800\" vs \"808333800800\". At pos 3? Let's check: pos0=8, pos1=0, pos2=8, pos3=0 vs 3, pos4=0 vs 3, pos5=0 vs 3, so columns 3-5 changed? Actually check: String \"808000800800\" length 12, index: 0:8,1:0,2:8, 3:0,4:0,5:0,6:8,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:8,11:0.\nOutput: \"808333800800\": indices: 0:8,1:0,2:8,3:3,4:3,5:3,6:8,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:8,11:0.\nSo differences: positions 3,4,5 changed from 0 to 3. So in line2, three consecutive zeros turned to 3's.\n\nLine3: \"000808888808\" vs \"000838888808\". Difference: Compare: \"000808888808\" vs \"000838888808\". At index? Let's check: \nIndices: 0:0,1:0,2:0, index3:8 vs 3:8 same, index4:0 vs 4:3? Actually check: It might be index 4 becomes 3. Let's re-check: \"000808888808\" if we look carefully: char by char:\n0: '0'\n1: '0'\n2: '0'\n3: '8'\n4: '0'\n5: '8'\n6: '8'\n7: '8'\n8: '8'\n9: '0'\n10: '8'\n11: '0'\nOutput: \"000838888808\": \n0: '0'\n1: '0'\n2: '0'\n3: '8'\n4: '3'\n5: '8'\n6: '8'\n7: '8'\n8: '8'\n9: '8'\n10: '0'\n11: '8'\nDifference: In line3, index4 changed from 0 to 3, and also index9 changed from 0 to 8? Wait, let's compare index by index:\nIndices:\n0: 0 vs 0\n1: 0 vs 0\n2: 0 vs 0\n3: 8 vs 8\n4: 0 vs 3 (so that's one change)\n5: 8 vs 8\n6: 8 vs 8\n7: 8 vs 8\n8: 8 vs 8\n9: 0 vs 8 (so that's second change)\n10: 8 vs 0? Let's check index 10: In input: index10 is '8'? Actually check carefully: I need to re-read string \"000808888808\": Let's count carefully: \n\"000808888808\"\nIndices:\n0: '0'\n1: '0'\n2: '0'\n3: '8'\n4: '0'\n5: '8'\n6: '8'\n7: '8'\n8: '8'\n9: '0'\n10: '8'\n11: '0'\nOutput: \"000838888808\":\nIndices:\n0: '0'\n1: '0'\n2: '0'\n3: '8'\n4: '3'\n5: '8'\n6: '8'\n7: '8'\n8: '8'\n9: '8'\n10: '0'\n11: '8'\nSo differences: index4: 0->3, index9: 0->8, index10: 8->0, index11: 0->8. But then check index 10: input index10= '8' becomes output index10= '0'? But then index 11: input index11= '0' becomes output index11= '8'. So these 2 digits swapped? But then line2 second example is different. Let's re-read carefully line3 input: \"000808888808\". Could it be that the string is \"000808888808\" but maybe it's \"000808888808\"? Let me check the count carefully: The string \"000808888808\" - if we take groups: \"000\", \"808\", \"888\", \"808\". That is 3 groups of 4 digits? Actually check: \"000\" (3 digits) then \"808\" (3 digits) then \"888\" (3 digits) then \"808\" (3 digits) gives 12 digits. But then \"000808888808\" grouping into 3-digit groups: group1: \"000\", group2: \"808\", group3: \"888\", group4: \"808\". But then comparing with output \"000838888808\" groups into: group1: \"000\", group2: \"838\", group3: \"888\", group4: \"808\". So the transformation in group2: \"808\" becomes \"838\". So it seems that rule may be applied to 3-digit groups? Let's check other lines: They are 12 digits long, but maybe they are partitioned into 3-digit chunks? But 12 digits can be grouped into 4 groups of 3 digits. Let's check e.g. 1: \"800\" \"800\" \"088\" \"080\" vs output: \"800\" \"830\" \"088\" \"080\". So group2 changed from \"800\" to \"830\". Group3: \"088\" to \"088\" (unchanged) in line1? Wait, line1: \"800800088080\" grouping into three-digit groups: \nGroup1: \"800\"\nGroup2: \"800\"\nGroup3: \"088\"\nGroup4: \"080\"\nBut output: \"800830088080\" groups: \nGroup1: \"800\"\nGroup2: \"830\"\nGroup3: \"088\"\nGroup4: \"080\".\nSo group2 changed from \"800\" to \"830\". Now check line2: \"808000800800\" groups into three-digit groups:\nGroup1: \"808\"\nGroup2: \"000\"\nGroup3: \"800\"\nGroup4: \"800\"\nOutput: \"808333800800\" groups:\nGroup1: \"808\"\nGroup2: \"333\"\nGroup3: \"800\"\nGroup4: \"800\"\nSo group2 changed from \"000\" to \"333\".\nLine3: \"000808888808\" groups into:\nGroup1: \"000\"\nGroup2: \"808\"\nGroup3: \"888\"\nGroup4", "prompt_tokens": 841, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's restate the problem: It says: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" So the question is: We have three examples each with different input and corresponding output. They are grids. They are provided as strings of digits. The digits are written in lines. The output is another grid. We need to deduce the transformation rule.\n\nLet's inspect each example:\n\nExample 1:\nInput grid:\nLine1: 9400490099\nLine2: 4994990090\nLine3: 0055555509\nLine4: 9459099504\nLine5: 4450040544\nLine6: 9454909500\nLine7: 0950400504\nLine8: 0455555544\nLine9: 9099409000\nLine10: 9990949900\n\nOutput grid:\nLine1: 9400490099 (unchanged)\nLine2: 4994990090 (unchanged)\nLine3: 0055555509 (unchanged)\nLine4: 9454044504\nLine5: 4450090544\nLine6: 9459404500\nLine7: 0950900504\nLine8: 0455555544 (unchanged)\nLine9: 9099409000 (unchanged)\nLine10: 9990949900 (unchanged)\n\nWhat transformations happened? Compare line by line:\n\nLine4: input \"9459099504\" vs output \"9454044504\". Let's check differences: Compare digit by digit: \n- digit index 0:9 same\n- index1: 4 same\n- index2: 5 same\n- index3: 9 vs 4? Actually \"9459\" vs \"9454\", so changed at index 3? Let's check index 3: input has \"9\", output has \"4\".\n- index4: input \"0\" vs output \"0\"\n- index5: input \"9\" vs output \"4\"? Let's check: original: 9459099504, if we break: digits: 9,4,5,9,0,9,9,5,0,4. Output: 9,4,5,4,0,4,9,5,0,4.\nSo transformation: at indices 3 and 5, the digits changed from 9 to 4. Also look at index? Let's check lines further:\nLine5: input \"4450040544\" vs output \"4450090544\". Compare: They are same until index? Let's check digits: \ninput: 4,4,5,0,0,4,0,5,4,4 \noutput: 4,4,5,0,0,9,0,5,4,4. So difference at index 5: changed from 4 to 9.\nLine6: input \"9454909500\" vs output \"9459404500\". Compare: digits: 9,4,5,4,9,0,9,5,0,0 vs output: 9,4,5,9,4,0,5,4,5,0? Let's re-read: Actually check line6 input: \"9454909500\" -> digits: index0:9, index1:4, index2:5, index3:4, index4:9, index5:0, index6:9, index7:5, index8:0, index9:0.\nOutput: \"9459404500\" digits: index0:9, index1:4, index2:5, index3:9, index4:4, index5:0, index6:5, index7:4, index8:5, index9:0.\nSo differences: index3: \"4\" changed to \"9\", index4: \"9\" changed to \"4\", index6: \"9\" changed to \"5\", index7: \"5\" changed to \"4\", index8: \"0\" changed to \"5\".\n\nLine7: input \"0950400504\" vs output \"0950900504\": digits: input: 0,9,5,0,4,0,0,5,0,4, output: 0,9,5,0,9,0,0,5,0,4, so difference at index4 changed from 4 to 9.\n\nSo what pattern? It's not consistent with a region selection. Let's check positions of changes. Possibly they are flipping digits in a \"spiral\" or pattern? Maybe it's a specific pattern: Look at unchanged rows: row1, row2, row3, row8, row9, row10 remained unchanged. Only modifications in rows 4,5,6,7.\n\nMaybe the transformation is operating on the \"central\" 4 rows? Actually rows 4-7 are changed. Look at the grid shape: 10 rows, 10 columns. Rows 0,1,2,7,8,9 unchanged. Only rows 4,5,6 are modified except row7 also changed slightly? Let's re-read: Actually row7 \"0950400504\" vs \"0950900504\" changed index4 digit.\n\nSo which rows changed? Row4 changed, row5 changed, row6 changed, row7 changed? Let's check row7: input row7 \"0455555544\" vs output row7 \"0455555544\": no change? Let's re-read carefully:\n\nGiven example 1:\n\nLine1: 9400490099 (unchanged)\nLine2: 4994990090 (unchanged)\nLine3: 0055555509 (unchanged)\nLine4: 9459099504 -> becomes 9454044504\nLine5: 4450040544 -> becomes 4450090544\nLine6: 9454909500 -> becomes 9459404500\nLine7: 0950400504 -> becomes 0950900504\nLine8: 0455555544 (unchanged)\nLine9: 9099409000 (unchanged)\nLine10: 9990949900 (unchanged)\n\nSo rows that changed: row4, row5, row6, row7. And rows 0,1,2,7? Actually check row7: \"0950400504\" vs \"0950900504\", yes changed. So the changed rows are 3, 4, 5, 6? Wait, indexing: if we count rows starting from 0 then changed rows: row3 (line4) changed, row4 (line5) changed, row5 (line6) changed, row6 (line7) changed. So it is a 4-row band in the middle? Because total 10 rows, so rows 0-2 and rows 7-9 remain same, and rows 3-6 changed. Let's check: row3 is line4, row4 is line5, row5 is line6, row6 is line7.\n\nNow look at columns: which columns changed? Let's examine row3 (line4) differences: \"9459099504\" vs \"9454044504\". Changed at indices 3 and 5, and also index? Let's check: \nindex0: 9 remains, index1:4 remains, index2:5 remains, index3:9 becomes 4, index4:0 remains, index5:9 becomes 4, index6:9 remains? Actually check: row3 input: digit0=9,1=4,2=5,3=9,4=0,5=9,6=9,7=5,8=0,9=4.\nOutput: 9,4,5,4,0,4,9,5,0,4.\nSo changed at index3 (9->4) and index5 (9->4). \nRow4 (line5): input: 4450040544 vs output: 4450090544. Changed at index5: input digit 4 becomes output digit 9.\nRow5 (line6): input: 9454909500 vs output: 9459404500. Changed at index3: 4->9, index4: 9->4, index6: 9->5, index7: 5->4, index8: 0->5.\nRow6 (line7): input: 0950400504 vs output: 0950900504. Changed at index4: 4->9.\n\nSo the pattern seems like a specific transformation of digits in a \"cross\" shape: Possibly a \"plus\" shape in the center.\n\nMaybe we can look at the positions changed:\nFor row3 (0-indexed row 3): changed columns: 3 and 5.\nFor row4: changed column: 5.\nFor row5: changed columns: 3,4,6,7,8.\nFor row6: changed column: 4.\n\nMaybe these indices correspond to positions in a NxN cross shape? It might be the pattern of a spiral? Alternatively, maybe it's a rotation of a \"diagonal\" rectangle? Let's check E.g. 2.\n\nExample 2:\nInput grid:\nRow0: 0086060808\nRow1: 8555555550\nRow2: 0508866058\nRow3: 6566680658\nRow4: 0566860658\nRow5: 6588868058\nRow6: 6568686858\nRow7", "prompt_tokens": 771, "completion_tokens": 2048}

{"task_id": "817e6c09", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus:free", "raw_response": "We are given multiple examples, each with input and output grids. The task: deduce transformation rule and apply to final test input grid. The problem is from ARC, so the transformation rule is likely something like \"mirror or duplicate pattern\" or \"scaling\" or \"replacing pairs of digits with similar patterns\" etc.\n\nLet's inspect examples.\n\nWe see examples in text: They are given as \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then a grid of strings with no obvious structure? They are provided as lines separated by newlines. Possibly they are binary grids? Wait, they are strings of digits \"0\" and \"2\". In E.g. 1, we have numbers like \"22000000000220000\" etc. The transformation in e.g. 1: It seems the output grid is obtained by replacing \"2\" with \"8\" in some positions. But let's compare:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nLine 1: \"22000000000220000\"\nOutput: \"88000000000880000\"\nSo line 1: replaced leading \"2\" with \"8\". However, then line 2:\nInput: \"22002200000220000\"\nOutput: \"88008800000880000\" \nSo it appears that some \"22\" become \"88\"? But then line 3:\n\"00002202200000000\" becomes \"00008808800000000\"\nI see that each \"22\" becomes \"88\"? But then line 4:\n\"02200002200002200\" becomes \"02200008800002200\". So where did \"22\" become \"88\"? It is not consistent. Wait check line 1: \"22000000000220000\" output: \"88000000000880000\". So digits \"2\" turned into \"8\" in the first and last group. But then line 2: \"22002200000220000\" becomes \"88008800000880000\". It seems the transformation is not a simple replacement of all \"2\" with \"8\", because then line 4 \"02200002200002200\" would become \"08800008800008800\" but actual output is \"02200008800002200\". So some \"2\" remain \"2\". So rule is not simply replace \"2\" with \"8\".\n\nMaybe it's more like \"mirror\" or \"rotate\" or \"flip\" some region? Let's check differences.\n\nLook at E.g. 1, line 1: Input: 22000000000220000, output: 88000000000880000.\nThe difference: positions where \"2\" becomes \"8\" are the ones on the boundaries? Let's check positions of '2' in input: There are \"2\" digits at positions 0 and 1? Actually, let's index positions 0-indexed from left. In line 1, input: \"22000000000220000\". It seems to be 17 characters? Let's count: \"22\" then \"0000000000\"? Actually, wait, count: \"22000000000220000\" length? Count: \"22\" -> 2 digits, then \"0000000000\" -> 10 digits, then \"22\" -> 2 digits, then \"0000\" -> 4 digits, total 2+10+2+4=18. So length 18. But output \"88000000000880000\" also length 18. So positions: index 0-1 become 8, then indices? But then line 4, input \"02200002200002200\": The output \"02200008800002200\": only a portion becomes 88. Let's try to align columns maybe.\n\nMaybe transformation is not a simple digit replacement but something like \"combine\" or \"encode\" something.\n\nMaybe it's a rule that \"if a 2 appears in a cell that is adjacent to another 2, then output becomes 8\"? But then which ones become 8? Wait look at e.g. 1 line 1: \"22000000000220000\": The pairs \"22\" at beginning become \"88\", and the pair \"22\" in the middle become \"88\"? Actually, check: \"22000000000220000\". There are two occurrences of \"22\": one at the beginning positions 0-1, and one at positions? Let's find: It might be \"22\" at the beginning, then at positions 10-11 there is \"22\"? Let's check: The string \"22000000000220000\" can be segmented as: \"22\" then \"0000000000\" then \"22\" then \"0000\"? But then output \"88000000000880000\" segments as: \"88\" then \"0000000000\" then \"88\" then \"0000\". So pattern: wherever there are two adjacent 2's in a row, they are replaced by \"88\". But then check line 2: \"22002200000220000\" -> output \"88008800000880000\". Let's break line 2: The string is \"22 00 22 0000 22 0000\"? Let's try segmenting by consecutive 2's:\nLine 2 input: \"22002200000220000\". Let me index: characters:\n0:2, 1:2, 2:0, 3:0, 4:2, 5:2, 6:0, 7:0, 8:0, 9:0, 10:2, 11:2, 12:0, 13:0, 14:0, 15:0, 16:0, 17:0? Wait lengths: Actually, we need to count carefully. The provided strings maybe are separated by line breaks, but they might be variable length. Wait, the examples are given as one contiguous string without spaces. They are like \"22000000000220000\". They might be grids where each line is a cell row of a square grid. But the lengths vary across examples. Possibly they are fixed width grids. Let's check: E.g. 1 had 18 characters per line? Actually, count digits in e.g. 1 first line: \"22000000000220000\". Count digits: 2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0. That is 18 digits. The second line also 18 digits. So grid is 7 rows by 18 columns? Actually, count rows: E.g. 1 input has 7 lines. So grid 7x18. E.g. 2 input: They are given as maybe 7 lines? Actually, E.g. 2 input: There are 7 lines? Let's check: \"00000000000022\" is first line, then \"02202200000022\", then \"02202200022000\", then \"00000000022000\", then \"00022002200000\", then \"00022002200000\", then \"00000000000000\". So grid is 7x14 maybe. Wait, count digits in first line: \"00000000000022\" is 14 characters (12 zeros then 22). So grid 7x14.\n\nE.g. 3 input: \"000000220000000\" (15 digits?) Actually, count: \"000000220000000\" is 15 digits, so grid is 7 rows x 15 columns maybe.\nE.g. 4 input: \"0000000\" is 7 digits, so grid 7x7.\nE.g. 5 input: \"00000\" is 5 digits, so grid 7 rows x 5 columns.\n\nSo grid size varies. The transformation rule might be \"replace every 2 that is part of a contiguous pair (horizontally) with 8\". But then check e.g. 1: line 1: \"22\" at start becomes \"88\", but then what about line 1: last group \"22\" becomes \"88\". But then line 2: \"22\" at start becomes \"88\", then \"22\" in the middle becomes \"88\", then \"22\" at the end becomes \"88\". But wait, line 2: \"22002200000220000\". Let's break it: positions: 0-1: \"22\" -> becomes \"88\"; then positions 2-3: \"00\"; then positions 4-5: \"22\" -> becomes \"88\"; then positions 6-9: \"0000\"; then positions 10-11: \"22\" -> becomes \"88\"; then positions 12-17: \"0000\" but output last part? Actually, output: \"88008800000880000\". Let's check: output: \"88\" then \"00\" then \"88\" then \"0000\" then \"88\" then \"0000\"? But output given is \"88008800000880000\". Let's count: \"88\" (2 digits) then \"00\" (2 digits) then \"88\" (2 digits) then \"0000\" (4 digits) then \"88\" (2 digits) then \"0000\" (4 digits) totals 2+2+2+4+2+4 = 16, but expected 18. Wait, let's re-check: Actually, the original string \"22002200000220000\" should be 18 characters. Let's count manually: digits: \n0:2\n1:2\n2:0\n3:0\n4:2\n5:2\n6:0\n7:0\n8:0\n9:0\n10", "prompt_tokens": 855, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" So we need to deduce rule.\n\nIt looks like these are ARC tasks where the input grid is 3x? Actually, note the shape: The examples are similar to pattern detection tasks from ARC. They involve reading blocks from the input grid. The output is a smaller grid, typically with a few rows. Let's try to see the pattern.\n\nI suspect that the examples represent a pattern of a central \"target\" region in the input grid. The input grid might be 19 rows by 14 columns? Let's check e.g. 1: The example input has 20 rows? Actually, let's count: The provided e.g. 1 input lines: There are 20 lines? Let's count:\nLine 1: \"0000600006000\"\nLine 2: \"0440606606088\"\nLine 3: \"0440606606088\"\nLine 4: \"0000600006000\"\nLine 5: \"6666666666666\"\nLine 6: \"0000600006000\"\nLine 7: \"0880606606033\"\nLine 8: \"0880606606033\"\nLine 9: \"0000600006000\"\nLine 10: \"6666666666666\"\nLine 11: \"0000600006000\"\nLine 12: \"0660608806044\"\nLine 13: \"0660608806044\"\nLine 14: \"0000600006000\"\nLine 15: \"6666666666666\"\nLine 16: \"0000600006000\"\nLine 17: \"0660606606066\"\nLine 18: \"0660606606066\"\nLine 19: \"0000600006000\"\n\nSo there are 19 rows. But output has 3 rows. And each output row is shorter: \"300\", \"440\", \"888\". So maybe the transformation picks out a 3x? region from the input grid.\n\nLet's inspect the structure of e.g. 1 input grid. It seems to have repeating blocks: There are blocks separated by rows that are \"0000600006000\". And the grid has a repeating pattern: the grid is arranged in 3 columns of blocks horizontally: top-left block, top-right block, maybe center block? Actually, let's see structure:\n\nMaybe the grid is composed of a border and a center. The input grid seems to be symmetric. Let's look at row 2 of e.g. 1: \"0440606606088\". It is 14 characters long. And row 1 is \"0000600006000\". So maybe the grid width is 14. And the output is \"300\", \"440\", \"888\" which are 3 columns wide. The output height is 3 rows. So the transformation might be to extract a 3x3 subgrid from the input grid, but not exactly.\n\nWait, look at e.g. 1: The input grid has 19 rows and 14 columns. The output grid has 3 rows and 3 columns. In e.g. 2: The input grid has 17 rows and maybe 16 columns? Let's count: \"0000300003000030\" is 16 characters. The output is \"220\", \"111\" (2 rows, 2 columns). In e.g. 3: The input grid has 19 rows and 20 columns? Let's count: \"000020000200002000\" is 20 characters. The output is \"8000\", \"1100\", \"4444\" (3 rows, 4 columns).\n\nSo pattern: In e.g. 1, output dimensions: 3x3.\nIn e.g. 2, output dimensions: 2x2.\nIn e.g. 3, output dimensions: 3x4.\n\nTest input: The test input grid is:\nLine lengths: \"000080000800008000080\" count digits: Let's count: \"000080000800008000080\". Count: group them: \"000\" \"080\" \"000\" \"080\" \"000\" \"080\". Actually, I'll count carefully:\n\"000080000800008000080\"\nBreak: \"000\" then \"080\" then \"000\" then \"080\" then \"000\" then \"080\". That gives groups: Actually, wait, let me count manually: Characters:\n0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,8,0? Let's count digits: It seems to be 21 digits maybe.\nWait, count: \"000080000800008000080\" \nI can count: It has groups of 6 digits: \"000080\", \"000800\", \"008000\", \"080\"?

Actually check symmetry:\nRow1: \"243342\"\nRow6: \"243342\"\nRow2: \"043340\"\nRow5: \"043340\"\nRow3: \"003300\"\nRow4: \"003300\"\n\nSo the output grid is symmetric about horizontal center (the top half is mirrored to bottom half). Also each row is symmetric about vertical center maybe? Let's check: \"243342\" reversed is \"243342\", so it's palindromic. \"043340\" reversed is \"043340\". \"003300\" reversed is \"003300\".\n\nAlso, the output grid is basically produced by taking the input grid and then placing it in the center of a larger grid with some transformation? Wait, let\u2019s check: maybe the transformation rule is \"flip the input grid, rotate it, and then duplicate values?\" The example \"300\" becomes \"003300\"? Actually, wait: Let's analyze the mapping from input to output.\n\nWe have input grid:\n[ [3,0,0],\n  [3,4,0],\n  [3,4,2] ] where each element is a digit.\n\nNow output grid: 6 rows, 6 columns.\nMaybe the rule: reflect the input grid about both axes, then fill the outer part with the reversed digits? But then why the numbers are \"2,4,3,3,4,2\"? That looks like concatenation of digits from reading input row numbers in reverse order but with some transformation.\n\nLet\u2019s check the center of output grid corresponds to input grid positions? For instance, the middle four rows (rows 3 and 4) are \"003300\". Possibly they are computed by \"taking the input grid's first row \"300\", then reversed \"003\" concatenated? Wait, but \"300\" reversed is \"003\", but then the output row is \"003300\", which is \"003\" and then \"300\". And row2 of output: \"043340\" is \"034\" reversed becomes \"430\"? Not exactly.\n\nMaybe each output row is constructed by concatenating a row from the input grid, a transformation of that row, and then its mirror? Let's try: The output grid rows: They are symmetric horizontally (palindromic). They are 6 digits. They might be formed by taking a 3-digit segment, and then its mirror. For example, row1: \"243342\" can be split into \"243\" and \"342\", which is the reverse of \"243\"? Actually, check: \"243\" reversed is \"342\". So row1 is \"243\" concatenated with its reverse \"342\". Row2: \"043340\" is \"043\" concatenated with \"340\" reversed? Actually, \"043\" reversed is \"340\". Row3: \"003300\" is \"003\" concatenated with \"300\" reversed? Wait, but \"003\" reversed is \"300\". So pattern: The output rows are formed by taking a 3-digit sequence (the \"left half\") and then appending its reverse. And the rows are arranged in a symmetric pattern vertically. The left halves in output rows appear to be: top row: \"243\", second row: \"043\", third row: \"003\", then \"003\", then \"043\", then \"243\". So it's symmetric vertically.\n\nNow what are these left halves? They are 3-digit sequences derived from the input grid? The input grid rows are: \"300\", \"340\", \"342\". How do we get \"243\", \"043\", \"003\"? They are \"300\" reversed? Not exactly: \"300\" reversed is \"003\". And \"340\" reversed is \"043\". And \"342\" reversed is \"243\". So that's exactly the pattern: The left half of each output row is the reverse of the corresponding input row. But then the output is doubled horizontally (i.e., left half is the reversed input row, and right half is the mirror of that left half). And then the output grid is symmetric vertically, meaning that the top half of the output grid is the reversed input rows in the same order as input rows? But wait, check ordering: The first output row uses reversed row \"243\" which comes from the third input row \"342\" reversed. The second output row uses reversed row \"043\" from the second input row \"340\" reversed. The third output row uses reversed row \"003\" from the first input row \"300\" reversed. And then the bottom half repeats these rows in reverse order: row4: \"003\", row5: \"043\", row6: \"243\". So the transformation rule for Example 1 appears to be: Given an input grid with n rows (n=3 in example), produce an output grid with 2*n rows. For each input row, compute its reversed string (i.e., digits). Then, the top half of the output grid, from row1 to row_n, should be that reversed string concatenated with itself reversed? Actually, more precisely, each output row is the concatenation of a left half (which is the reversed input row) and its mirror (which is the reverse of that left half). That makes each output row a palindrome. And then the output grid is symmetric vertically: the bottom half is the mirror of the top half.\n\nSo the transformation rule: Let input grid be of dimensions r x c (here r=3, c=3). The output grid will be of dimensions 2*r x 2*c. For i from 0 to r-1, let row_i_input be the i-th row. Then let A_i = the reverse of row_i_input. Then the top half of output rows (i from 0 to r-1) is row i = A_i concatenated with reverse(A_i) to form a palindrome of length 2*c. And then the bottom half of output is the mirror of the top half (i.e., rows r-1 down to 0). \nCheck Example 1: input row0: \"300\", reversed \"003\", output row0: \"003\" + \"300\" = \"003300\". But that doesn't match. Wait check: For row0, we would get \"003300\", but example output row3 is \"003300\". So maybe the order is reversed: top half are not in order of input rows but in reverse order of input rows. Let's check: \nWe have input rows: \nRow0: \"300\" -> reversed \"003\"\nRow1: \"340\" -> reversed \"043\"\nRow2: \"342\" -> reversed \"243\"\nNow, output: first row (row0) equals \"243342\" which equals \"243\" + \"342\". And \"243\" is the reversed of \"342\", so that corresponds to input row2's reversed. Second row (row1) equals \"043340\" which equals \"043\" + \"340\". Third row (row2) equals \"003300\", which equals \"003\" + \"300\", corresponding to input row0's reversed.\nThen the bottom half repeats: row3 \"003300\", row4 \"043340\", row5 \"243342\". So the order is: top half rows: input row2 reversed, then input row1 reversed, then input row0 reversed, then mirror that order. So rule: The output grid's top half is the input rows in reverse order, each turned into a palindrome by appending its reverse. Then the bottom half is the mirror of the top half. In addition, the number of digits in each output row is double the number of digits in each input row.\n\nNow check Example 2:\nInput grid:\nRow0: \"0600\"\nRow1: \"4603\"\nRow2: \"4630\"\nRow3: \"4330\"\nSo input has 4 rows, each row length 4. The output grid has 8 rows, each row length 8. Let's check: It is given as:\nRow0: \"03344330\"\nRow1: \"03644630\"\nRow2: \"30644603\"\nRow3: \"00600600\"\nRow4: \"00600600\"\nRow5: \"30644603\"\nRow6: \"03644630\"\nRow7: \"03344330\"\nLet's decode: The top half rows (first 4 rows) should be the input rows in reverse order (i.e., row3, row2, row1, row0) each turned into a palindrome by concatenating its reverse. Let's compute:\nInput row3: \"4330\" reversed becomes \"0343\". Then palindrome: \"4330\" + \"0343\" reversed? Wait, check: the pattern in example1: Output row = (reversed(input row)) concatenated with (reverse(reversed(input row)) which is just the input row). But that yields input row concatenated with input row reversed? Let's re-read example1:\nFor row", "prompt_tokens": 507, "completion_tokens": 2048}

I'll re-read each row, then compare differences between input and output.\n\nE.g. 1 Input vs Output:\n\nRow 0: Input: 0200110500000000, Output: 0200110500000000. They are identical.

Let's check:\n\nInput row 1: \"2220100500333000\"\nOutput row 1: \"2220100500222000\"\n\nLet's align: \nColumns:\n0:2,1:2,2:2, 3:0, 4:1, 5:0, 6:0, 7:5, 8:0, 9:0, 10:3, 11:3, 12:3, 13:0, 14:0, 15:0.\nOutput row 1: 2220100500222000:\nBreak: 0:2,1:2,2:2,3:0,4:1,5:0,6:0,7:5,8:0,9:0,10:2,11:2,12:2,13:2,14:0,15:0.\nSo differences: columns 10-13 changed from \"3330\" to \"2222\"? Wait, check carefully:\nInput: columns 10-13: \"0333\"? Actually let's recalc:\nRow1: \"2220100500333000\"\nIndex: \n0:2\n1:2\n2:2\n3:0\n4:1\n5:0\n6:0\n7:5\n8:0\n9:0\n10:0? Wait recalc carefully: \"2220100500333000\" digits: 2,2,2,0,1,0,0,5,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0.\nNow output row1: \"2220100500222000\": digits: 2,2,2,0,1,0,0,5,0,0,2,2,2,2,0,0.\nSo difference: digits 10,11,12,13 changed: from \"0333\" to \"2222\"? Actually wait, input digits 10 is 0, 11 is 3, 12 is 3, 13 is 3. Output digits: 10=2, 11=2, 12=2, 13=2. So it seems that the transformation replaced some pattern: maybe sum of two digits? But then check row 2: \nRow 2: Input: 0000000500030000, Output: 0000000500020000.\nCompare: \"0000000500030000\" vs \"0000000500020000\". So difference: digits at positions? Likely again same shift: output digits 10,11,12,13: input: \"0003\" becomes \"0002\"? Actually \"0003\" vs \"0002\" so difference: last digit changed from 3 to 2? But in row1, the changed block was 4 digits: \"0333\" changed to \"2222\". They are not consistent.\n\nLet's re-read carefully row 1 differences: \"2220100500333000\" vs \"2220100500222000\". It seems blocks \"0333\" changed to \"2222\". But row2: \"0000000500030000\" vs \"0000000500020000\". Here, \"003\" changed to \"002\"? But then row 3: \"5555555500000000\" -> \"5555555500000000\", no change.\n\nRow 4: Input: \"0000000000000330\", Output: \"0000000000000110\". So difference: probably the block \"033\" changed to \"011\"? Actually digits: Input row 4: last 4 digits \"0330\", Output: \"0110\". So it changed: maybe it sums two numbers? Possibly the transformation takes a certain structure: maybe it's scanning for a pattern \"0?3\"? Actually, look at row 5: Input: \"0000000000000300\", Output: \"0000000000000100\". So similar change: \"0300\" becomes \"0100\". So row 4,5: pattern: \"0330\" -> \"0110\", \"0300\" -> \"0100\". \n\nRow 6: Input: \"0030000330000000\", Output: \"0020000110000000\". Let's break it: Input: \"0030000330000000\" -> \"003 000033 0000000\"? Actually, it might be splitting into segments: Possibly the rule is: For each contiguous block of 3-digit segments, maybe add 1 to the middle digit? Not sure.\n\nLet's try to see pattern: Compare row 6 input: 0030000330000000. Output: 0020000110000000.\nObserving columns in groups of 3? Possibly the rule is: subtract 1 from every digit that is a 3 in some specific pattern? But then row", "prompt_tokens": 1095, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let me check the provided examples:\n\nE.g. 1 Input lines:\n\"3103333303\"\n\"1003301311\"\n\"0111030003\"\n\"0133031300\"\n\"1311013000\"\n\"0113003113\"\n\"3010000030\"\n\"0003310013\"\n\"3310011001\"\n\"0130111113\"\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n\"3123333323\"\n\"1223351311\"\n\"2111532223\"\n\"2133531322\"\n\"1311513222\"\n\"2113553113\"\n\"3215555532\"\n\"2223315513\"\n\"3312211551\"\n\"2132111113\"\n\nObserving pattern maybe rule: It seems each digit is transformed somehow, maybe each digit is incremented by 1 or something. But let's check.\n\nLet's attempt to determine transformation rule from example 1.\n\nI will denote positions as (row, col) maybe with indices. We see input and output digits.\n\nI'll consider the transformation: Perhaps each digit is replaced by a digit that is 1 more than it, but then 3 becomes 4? But in e.g. 1, input's first digit row: \"3103333303\". Output row: \"3123333323\". Compare digit by digit:\nInput: 3 1 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3.\nOutput: 3 1 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3.\nSo the transformation: The second digit remains same? Actually let's list differences.\nPosition 1: input 3 -> output 3, no change.\nPosition 2: input 1 -> output 1, no change.\nPosition 3: input 0 -> output 2, so 0 became 2.\nPosition 4: input 3 -> output 3, no change.\nPosition 5: input 3 -> output 3, no change.\nPosition 6: input 3 -> output 3, no change.\nPosition 7: input 3 -> output 3, no change.\nPosition 8: input 3 -> output 3, no change.\nPosition 9: input 0 -> output 2, so 0 becomes 2.\nPosition 10: input 3 -> output 3.\nSo maybe rule: Replace 0 with 2? But then second row: \"1003301311\" -> \"1223351311\". Let's compare:\nRow 2: input digits: 1,0,0,3,3,0,1,3,1,1.\nOutput row: 1,2,2,3,3,5,1,3,1,1.\nMapping: index 2: originally 0 becomes 2, index 3: originally 0 becomes? Wait, let's index positions: \nIndex1: 1->1, index2: 0->2, index3: 0->2, index4: 3->3, index5: 3->3, index6: 0->5, index7: 1->1, index8: 3->3, index9: 1->1, index10: 1->1.\nSo it's not simply 0->2. At index6, input 0 becomes output 5. So rule not constant.\n\nMaybe it's summing digits of neighbors? Or maybe rule is: output digit = input digit plus number of adjacent 1's? But then index6: input 0 became 5, but neighbors? Let's check row2, column7. Coordinates: row2, col7: input digit 1. But then output digit remains 1.\n\nMaybe rule is: For each cell, output = (input digit + something) mod something? Let's check differences: In row1, differences: positions 3 and 9 changed from 0 to 2. In row2, differences: positions 2,3 changed from 0 to 2,2 and position6 changed from 0 to 5. Also row1, col? Let's check row3: Input row3: \"0111030003\"\nOutput row3: \"2111532223\"\nIndices: \ncol1: input 0 -> output 2, \ncol2: input 1 -> output 1, \ncol3: input 1 -> output 1, \ncol4: input 1 -> output 1, \ncol5: input 0 -> output 5, \ncol6: input 3 -> output 3, \ncol7: input 0 -> output 2, \ncol8: input 0 -> output 2, \ncol9: input 0 -> output 2, \ncol10: input 3 -> output 3.\nSo differences: col1: 0->2, col5: 0->5, col7, col8, col9: 0->2.\nRow4: \"0133031300\" -> \"2133531322\"\nIndices: \ncol1: 0->2, col2:1->1, col3:3->3, col4:3->3, col5:0->5, col6:3->3, col7:1->1, col8:3->3, col9:0->2, col10:0->2.\nSo pattern: whenever input digit is 0, sometimes output becomes 2, sometimes 5, sometimes 2, sometimes 2. Wait, row2, col6: 0->5, row3, col5: 0->5, row4, col5: 0->5. So maybe rule: if 0 appears, output is 2 or 5? Let's check row5: \"1311013000\" -> \"1311513222\"\nIndices:\ncol1: 1->1, col2:3->3, col3:1->1, col4:1->1, col5:0->5, col6:1->1, col7:3->3, col8:0->2, col9:0->2, col10:0->2.\nSo for row5, digits that are 0 become either 5 if they are in the middle? Row1, col3 and col9: 0->2, row2, col6: 0->5, row3, col1, col7, col8, col9: 0->? Actually row3: col1: 0->2, col5: 0->5, col7,8,9: 0->2, row4: col1 and col9: 0->2, col5: 0->5. row5: col5 is 0->5, col8, col9, col10: 0->2. So what distinguishes a 0 turning into 5? Possibly if 0 is adjacent to a 3? Let's check: In row3, col5 is 0 and its neighbors? row3: \"0111030003\", col5 is 0. Its neighbors: row3, col4 is 1, row3, col6 is 3, row2, col5 is 3, row4, col5 is 0. So maybe if a 0 is adjacent (maybe diagonally or orth adjacent?) to a 3 or something? Let's check row2, col6: input 0, neighbors: row2: digit at col5=3, col7=1, row1: col6=3, row3: col6=3, so it has 3's around. Row3, col5: neighbors: row3, col4=1, col6=3, row2, col5=3, row4, col5=0. Also row4, col5: input 0, neighbors: row4, col4=3, col6=3, row3, col5=0, row5, col5= ? row5, col5 is 0 originally? Actually row5: \"1311013000\", so col5=0, row4, col5=0. Not sure.\n\nMaybe rule: output cell = input cell + number of adjacent 1's? Let's test: Row1, col3: input 0, adjacent to? Coordinates row1, col3. Neighbors: row1, col2=1, row1, col4=3, row0 doesn't exist, row2, col3=1, row2, col2=0, row2, col4=3. Count adjacent 1's? There are row1, col2 is 1, row2, col3 is 1. That's 2, so output becomes 0+2=2. That fits row1, col3 becomes 2.\nNow check row2, col6: input 0, neighbors: row2, col5=3, row2, col7=1, row1, col6=3, row3, col6=3. Adjacent 1's? Only row2, col7", "prompt_tokens": 885, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The examples are labelled e.g. 1, e.g. 2, e.g. 3, e.g. 4. They illustrate some transformation rule. We need to deduce the hidden transformation rule from given examples. The transformation rule perhaps is something like: certain digits (numbers) in the grid are replaced by other numbers based on their neighbors. Let's analyze each example carefully.\n\nExample 1: Input and output grids provided.\n\nLet's re-read provided example 1 input and output.\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n```\n0000000000000\n0444000222000\n0404000202000\n0444000222000\n0000000000000\n0003333000000\n0003003000000\n0003333000000\n0000000000000\n0000000333000\n8888000303000\n8008000333000\n8888000000000\n```\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n```\n0000000000000\n0444000222000\n0454000252000\n0444000222000\n0000000000000\n0003333000000\n0003773000000\n0003333000000\n0000000000000\n0000000333000\n8888000353000\n8778000333000\n8888000000000\n```\nObservations: Changes appear to occur in row2: \"0404000202000\" becomes \"0454000252000\". Let's compare: row2 of input: \"0404000202000\", output: \"0454000252000\". So changes digits at positions? Let's align: index positions:\nInput row2: \"0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 0 0 0\"? Wait, careful: Each row is 14 characters, but we see \"0404000202000\" is 14 digits? Let's count: row1: \"0000000000000\" length 14, row2: \"0444000222000\" length 14, row3: \"0404000202000\" length 14, row4: \"0444000222000\", row5: \"0000000000000\", row6: \"0003333000000\", row7: \"0003003000000\", row8: \"0003333000000\", row9: \"0000000000000\", row10:\"0000000333000\", row11:\"8888000303000\", row12:\"8008000333000\", row13:\"8888000000000\". \n\nNow row3 changes from \"0404000202000\" to \"0454000252000\". Compare digit by digit:\nPositions: \n- 1st char: both are 0.\n- then \"4\" remains same. \n- Then next char: input row3: '0'? Let's write row3 with indices:\nindex: 0: '0'\n1: 4\n2: 0\n3: 4\n4: 0\n5: 0\n6: 0\n7: 2\n8: 2\n9: 0\n10:2\n11:0\n12:0\n13:0\nOutput row3: \"0 4 5 4 0 0 0 2 5 2 0 0 0 0\" Wait, check: given output row3: \"0454000252000\": that means index0: '0', index1: '4', index2: '5', index3: '4', index4:'0', index5:'0', index6:'0', index7:'2', index8:'5', index9:'2', index10:'0', index11:'0', index12:'0', index13:'0'. So differences: at index2 changed from 0 to 5, at index8 changed from 2 to 5, others same.\nRow6: input row6: \"0003333000000\", output row6: \"0003333000000\" - no change, but row7: \"0003003000000\" becomes \"0003773000000\". Compare row7: \"0003003000000\" vs \"0003773000000\". Differences: index? Let's index row7: \"0,0,0,3,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\". For output row7: \"0,0,0,3,7,7,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0\". So positions index3 is '3' same, index4 changed from 0 to 7, index5 changed from 0 to 7, index6 remains same (3).\nRow10: input row10: \"0000000333000\" vs output row10: \"0000000333000\" no change.\nRow11: input row11: \"8888000303000\", output row11: \"8888000353000\". Differences: compare: \"8888 00030 3000\" vs \"8888 00035 3000\". So digit at index? Let's index row11: string \"8888000303000\": indices: 0:8,1:8,2:8,3:8,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:3,9:0,10:3,11:0,12:0,13:0. Output row11: \"8888000353000\": indices: 0:8,1:8,2:8,3:8,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:3,9:5,10:3,11:0,12:0,13:0. So difference at index9: changed from 0 to 5.\nRow12: input row12: \"8008000333000\", output row12: \"8778000333000\". Compare: row12: \"8 0 0 8 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0\" vs \"8,7,7,8,0,0,0,3,3,3,3,0,0,0\". So differences: index1 changed from 0 to 7, index2 changed from 0 to 7. \nSo pattern: When do changes occur? They seem to occur in some inner rows, and the changed numbers are increased by something.\nWhat are the digits that are changed? They appear to be 0 changed to 5, 2 changed to 5, 0 changed to 7 in some cases.\n\nLet's check e.g. 2: \nE.g. 2 Input:\n```\n000000\n088800\n080800\n088800\n000000\n000000\n```\nE.g. 2 Output:\n```\n000000\n088800\n085800\n088800\n000000\n000000\n```\nCompare row2: input row2: \"088800\", output row2: \"088800\" no change.\nRow3: input row3: \"080800\", output row3: \"085800\". Compare digit by digit: \"0,8,0,8,0,0,0\" vs \"0,8,5,8,0,0,0\". So difference: the middle digit (index2) changed from 0 to 5.\nRow4: no change.\n\nE.g. 3:\nInput:\n```\n000000\n444000\n404000\n404000\n444000\n000000\n```\nOutput:\n```\n000000\n444000\n474000\n474000\n444000\n000000\n```\nRow3: input row3: \"404000\", output row3: \"474000\". So change: index1: \"4\" remains same, but index2: \"0\" changed to \"7\"? Actually, check: \"404000\": digits: 4,0,4,0,0,0. \"474000\": digits: 4,7,4,0,0,0. So index1 changed from 0 to 7.\nRow4: input row4: \"404000\" becomes \"474000\", same change: index1 changes from 0 to 7.\nSo pattern: In e.g. 3, the changed digit is in a row that is adjacent to a \"4\" row? The outer rows are boundaries? Actually, pattern: In e.g. 3, the grid has a border of zeros, then a border of \"4\"s on top and bottom, and then inner rows with \"404000\" pattern. And the transformation changed the digit in the second position (counting from 0 index) from 0 to 7. In e.g. 2, the changed digit was in the row with \"080800\", changed the middle digit from 0 to 5. But why 5 sometimes and 7 sometimes? Let's check e.g. 1 row details.\n\nObserving e.g. 1: The changed digits correspond to positions where there is a certain pattern: They are in rows with a \"border\" of characters? Let's look at rows: e.g. row3 of e.g. 1: \"0404000202000\" changed to \"0454000252000\". The changed digits: index2 changed from 0 to 5, index8 changed from 2 to 5. In row7: \"0003003000000\" changed to \"000377300", "prompt_tokens": 888, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We need to deduce the transformation rule from the examples and apply it to the final test input grid. The examples are \"provided input/output pairs\" but they are not entirely clear. Let's re-read the details:\n\nWe have multiple examples. They are provided with \"E.g. 1 Input: ...\" lines. Each example is a pair of input and output.\n\nWait, the provided text says: \"You are an expert in solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems. Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule. Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\" So we have examples: Example 1, Example 2, Example 3, Example 4, and then a \"Test Input\" grid.\n\nThe text \"E.g. 1 Input: \n002000400\n000000400\n000000000\n000000000\n555555555\n002000400\n002000400\n000000400\n000000400\nE.g. 1 Output:\n44\n44\" \n\nWait, I need to understand what is the structure of these examples. The input appears to be given as lines with digits \"0\", \"2\", \"4\", etc. And the output is \"44\" \"44\"? Or are these rows of a grid? The examples show the input as a series of lines separated by newlines (maybe each line is a row and digits represent entries of a grid). But the output seems to be \"44\" \"44\" as lines? Wait, the example: E.g. 1 Input: \n```\n002000400\n000000400\n000000000\n000000000\n555555555\n002000400\n002000400\n000000400\n000000400\n```\nE.g. 1 Output:\n```\n44\n44\n```\nSo the output grid is only 2 rows x something? Actually, the output is \"44\" then \"44\", so maybe each row is \"44\". But the provided input grid is bigger than 2 rows. Wait, what's the pattern?\n\nLet's re-read the examples carefully. Possibly the representation is that each example is a transformation from a grid input to a grid output, but the grid dimensions might be different.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is \"looking for a pattern\" among rows that have some numbers and then replacing them with a pattern of numbers that are like \"44\"? The outputs are always \"44\" on each output row. But the outputs are always 2 rows of same length \"44\" for each example. But then the test input is also a grid. The test input has lines: \n\"002000400\n002000400\n002000000\n000000000\n000000000\n555555555\n002000400\n002000400\n002000400\n002000400\n000000000\"\n\nWait, count rows: There are how many rows? Let's count: \n1: 002000400\n2: 002000400\n3: 002000000\n4: 000000000\n5: 000000000\n6: 555555555\n7: 002000400\n8: 002000400\n9: 002000400\n10: 002000400\n11: 000000000\n\nSo the test input grid is 11 rows, each row seems to be 9 columns (if \"002000400\" is 9 digits, then \"002000000\" is also 9 digits, etc.). But the outputs given in the examples are \"44\" on each line. But wait, \"44\" is just 2 characters, not 9. So maybe the outputs are not grid outputs, but they are some kind of transformation that results in a grid with a pattern that is given as \"44\" \"44\"? Possibly the transformation is not to produce a grid of same dimensions, but a grid that is derived from some pattern in the input.\n\nLet's re-read the problem text: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule.\" The examples are \"E.g. 1\", \"E.g. 2\", etc. So they are different examples of a transformation rule, but they are not independent puzzles? They might be different instances of the same transformation rule. And then there's a final test input grid to which we need to apply the rule.\n\nMaybe the grid transformation rule is: \"Take the leftmost digit of each row, count something, and produce an output grid that is a 2x? something pattern.\" But then the outputs are always \"44\". The outputs in the examples: E.g. 1 Output: \n\"44\n44\"\nE.g. 2 Output:\n\"22\n22\"\nE.g. 3 Output:\n\"22\n22\"\nE.g. 4 Output:\n\"22\n22\"\n\nSo the outputs are not the same as the inputs. Perhaps the transformation is to extract something from the input grid and then fill an output grid with a repeated pattern row. The output rows are only 2 characters wide? But the input rows are 9 digits.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is to count the number of \"0\"s, \"2\"s, \"4\"s etc. Possibly the transformation rule is about \"moving a pattern\" or \"rotating\" something. The numbers in the input: \"002000400\", \"000000400\", \"000000000\", \"000000000\", \"555555555\", \"002000400\", ... They might represent some kind of shape. The outputs \"44\", \"44\" in E.g. 1. In E.g. 2, output \"22\" rows, etc.\n\nMaybe the rule is to count the number of \"2\"s in the grid? For example, in E.g. 1 input, count occurrences of digit \"2\"? Let's count for E.g. 1: \nLine1: \"002000400\" has two \"2\"s? Actually let's count digits: row1: \"0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0\". That row has one \"2\"? Actually, \"002000400\": digits: 0,0,2,0,0,0,4,0,0. That row has one \"2\" at position 3 and one \"4\" at position 7. \nRow2: \"000000400\": digits: 0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0 (one \"4\").\nRow3: \"000000000\": no \"2\" or \"4\".\nRow4: \"000000000\": none.\nRow5: \"555555555\": none of 2 or 4? It has five 5's.\nRow6: \"002000400\": same as row1. \nRow7: \"002000400\": same as row1.\nRow8: \"000000400\": same as row2.\nRow9: \"000000400\": same as row2.\nSo count of \"2\"s: row1: one \"2\", row6: one \"2\", row7: one \"2\". Total three \"2\"s? Count of \"4\"s: row1: one \"4\", row2: one \"4\", row6: one \"4\", row7: one \"4\", row8: one \"4\", row9: one \"4\". Total six \"4\"s. But output \"44\" doesn't reflect these counts.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is to extract a pattern from the grid: maybe the rule is \"find the largest contiguous block of identical numbers\" or \"find the row with the number 5\" etc.\n\nWait, note: In many of the examples, there is a row with \"555555555\" (all 5's) - that appears in E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, and E.g. 4. In E.g. 1, row5 is \"555555555\". In E.g. 2, row5 is \"555555555\". In E.g. 3, row? Actually, check E.g. 3: \"555555555\" appears as row? Let's check E.g. 3 Input:\n```\n002000400\n000000400\n000000400\n000000000\n000000000\n555555555\n002000400\n002000400\n002000400\n002000400\n000000400\n```\nSo row6 is \"555555555\".\nSimilarly, E.g. 4 Input:\n```\n002000400\n002000400\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n555555555\n002000400\n002000400\n002000400\n002000000\n000000000\n```\nSo row6 is \"555555555\" in all examples.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Replace the region containing number 5 with something else, and then output a grid that is a 2x? pattern made of the digit that appears the most in the border of the 5 region?\" Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to \"flip\" the grid horizontally or vertically? But then the output is always a 2x2 grid in the examples? But the outputs given, like \"44\" on each line, are 2 characters. But then E.g. 2 and E.g. 3 and E.g. 4 outputs are \"22\" on each line. So why does E.g. 1 output \"44\" and others output \"22\"? It might be that the output is determined by the count of something in the input grid. Possibly the leftmost digit of each output row is determined by something.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: \"For each row", "prompt_tokens": 655, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We need to find the transformation rule. Let's read the examples carefully, then try to decipher.\n\nWe have four examples provided (E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, E.g. 4). Let's examine them.\n\nE.g. 1: Input:\nRow1: 000000000\nRow2: 000000000\nRow3: 003006000\nRow4: 000220000\nRow5: 000220000\nRow6: 008007000\nRow7: 000000000\nRow8: 000000000\nRow9: 000000000\n\nOutput:\nRow1: 800000030\nRow2: 080000300\nRow3: 008003000\nRow4: 000220000\nRow5: 000220000\nRow6: 007006000\nRow7: 070000600\nRow8: 700000060\nRow9: 000000006\n\nObserving differences: The output has rotated or mirrored something? Let's compare row by row.\n\nRow1 input \"000000000\" becomes \"800000030\". Notice that the digits \"8\" appears on left and \"30\" on right? Actually row1 input \"000000000\" becomes \"800000030\". So the transformation is not a simple identity because input row1 is all zeros, but output row1 is \"800000030\". So there is an insertion of digits \"8\" and \"30\" somewhere. Wait, check row2 input \"000000000\" becomes \"080000300\". Row3 input \"003006000\" becomes \"008003000\". Row4 input \"000220000\" remains exactly same \"000220000\". Row5 same \"000220000\", row6 \"008007000\" becomes \"007006000\", row7 \"000000000\" becomes \"070000600\", row8 \"000000000\" becomes \"700000060\", row9 \"000000000\" becomes \"000000006\". So transformation is not row independent, but the center rows? Possibly the transformation rotates the grid or reflects it. Maybe the transformation rule is \"Rotate 90 degrees clockwise\" or something? Let's test that: The input grid is 9x9. If we rotate 9x9 matrix 90 degrees clockwise, row1 becomes column? But then row1 output would be all zeros if input row1 is all zeros. But output row1 is \"800000030\". Alternatively, maybe the transformation is \"reflect horizontally\" or \"reflect vertically\"? \n\nLet's compare row1 input \"000000000\" vs row9 output \"000000006\". Actually, the output grid appears to be almost symmetric vertically? Let's check: The corners: In output row1, the first digit is 8, last is 30? Actually \"800000030\", but that is 9 digits; but wait, check length: \"800000030\" is 9 digits. Similarly row2 \"080000300\" is 9 digits, row3 \"008003000\", row4 \"000220000\", row5 \"000220000\", row6 \"007006000\", row7 \"070000600\", row8 \"700000060\", row9 \"000000006\". And the input grid is 9x9.\n\nMaybe transformation is: each digit in the output is computed by taking the corresponding digit in the input and doing some arithmetic with the digit in the symmetric position? Let's compare row3 input \"003006000\" and output \"008003000\". Compare column by column:\n- For row3: digits are: col1=0, col2=0, col3=3, col4=0, col5=0, col6=6, col7=0, col8=0, col9=0.\nOutput row3: \"008003000\": digits: col1=0, col2=0, col3=8, col4=0, col5=0, col6=3, col7=0, col8=0, col9=0.\nI see that the digits 3 and 6 swapped positions: The 3 in col3 became 8? Actually, wait: 3 vs 8, 6 vs 3? Wait, re-check: In row3 input, the third digit is 3, but in output row3, the third digit is 8. And the sixth digit in input is 6 but in output, the sixth digit is 3. So possibly rule: swap some pairs? Let's check row6: input \"008007000\" becomes output \"007006000\". Compare positions: row6 digits: 0,0,8,0,0,7,0,0,0. Output: 0,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0. So again, 8 and 7 swapped? But wait, row3: \"003006000\" digit positions: third digit 3 becomes 8, and sixth digit 6 becomes 3. Row6: \"008007000\": third digit 8 becomes 7, sixth digit 7 becomes 6. So pattern: It seems that the third and sixth digits are being swapped with some transformation. Let's check row1: input \"000000000\", output \"800000030\". So row1: initially all zeros, but then the output has an 8 in col1 and a 3 in col9. So maybe rule is: if a digit is 0, then in the output, it becomes a digit that is the complement to 9? But then row1: the positions 1 and 9 become 8 and 3 respectively. Wait, then row2: input \"000000000\", output \"080000300\". So row2: col1 becomes 0? Hmm, row1: first digit output is 8, row2: first digit output is 0, row3: first digit output is 0. So not consistent.\n\nMaybe the transformation is a rotation of the grid 90 degrees, but with some additional transformation on the numbers? Let's test possibility: maybe the rule is: rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise and then add the position of the cell's distance from the center? Alternatively, maybe the transformation is \"mirror horizontally\" then \"rotate 90 degrees\", or something like that.\n\nLet's try to see symmetry in rows: Notice that row4 and row5 are unchanged in example 1. They have \"000220000\" in both input and output. In row3, the digits 3 and 6 are swapped but replaced by 8 and 3? Wait, row3: input: 003006000, output: 008003000. So comparing row3: the first three digits: 0,0,3 vs output: 0,0,8. And last three digits: 000 vs output: 000. Actually, let's compare carefully:\n\nRow3 input: indices: 1:0, 2:0, 3:3, 4:0, 5:0, 6:6, 7:0, 8:0, 9:0.\nRow3 output: indices: 1:0, 2:0, 3:8, 4:0, 5:0, 6:3, 7:0, 8:0, 9:0.\nSo it looks like the digit at index 3 becomes digit 8, and the digit at index 6 becomes digit 3. Compare row6 input: 008007000 vs output: 007006000. So index 3:8 becomes 7, index 6:7 becomes 6. And row1: input: all zeros, output: 8 at index 1 and 3 at index 9. Row2: input: all zeros, output: 0 at index 1 and 3 at index 9? Actually, row2: output \"080000300\": digits: col1=0, col2=8, col3=0, ... col? Wait, re-read row2: \"080000300\": digits: index1=0, index2=8, index3=0, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0, index7=3, index8=0, index9=0. So row2, changed positions are col2 becomes 8, col7 becomes 3.\nRow7: input: all zeros, output: \"070000600\": digits: index1=0, index2=7, index3=0, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0, index7=6, index8=0, index9=0? Actually, check row7: \"070000600\": index1=0, index2=7, index3=0, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0, index7=6, index8=0, index9=0.\nRow8: input: all zeros, output: \"700000060\": digits: index1=7, index2=0, index3=0, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0, index7=0, index8=6, index9=0.\nRow9: input: all zeros, output: \"000000006\": index1=0, index2=0, index3=0, index4=0, index5=0, index6=0, index7=0, index8=0, index9=6.\n\nSo pattern: The output digits that are non-zero seem to be in", "prompt_tokens": 843, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check line lengths? Possibly it's a square? The provided output lines look 15 characters long maybe.\n\nWait, let's count: \"000000050000000\" is 15 characters. So output grid for E.g.1 is 16 rows x 15 columns? Let's count rows. Actually count rows: There are 16 rows in E.g. 1 output.

Let's check: Actually the text \"E.g. 1 Output:\" is followed by a block of lines. Count manually:\nLine 1: \"000000050000000\"\nLine 2: \"000000555000000\"\nLine 3: \"000000050000000\"\nLine 4: \"000000555000000\"\nLine 5: \"000000555000000\"\nLine 6: \"000000555000000\"\nLine 7: \"050555555555050\"\nLine 8: \"555555555555555\"\nLine 9: \"050555555555050\"\nLine 10: \"000000555000000\"\nLine 11: \"000000555000000\"\nLine 12: \"000000555000000\"\nLine 13: \"000000050000000\"\nLine 14: \"000000555000000\"\nLine 15: \"000000050000000\"\nThat's 15 lines. But then the provided E.g. 2 and E.g. 3 outputs are also similar sizes. Actually, let me count E.g.2: \nE.g. 2 Output is:\n```\n000000050000000\n000000550000000\n000000005000000\n000000555000000\n000000555000000\n000000555000000\n050555555000000\n550555555000000\n005555555000000\n000000000555050\n000000000555550\n000000000555005\n000000000050000\n000000000550000\n000000000005000\n```\nThat is 15 lines? Actually, let me count: There are 15 lines, each line length 15? Check: \"000000050000000\" length count: 15 characters. So output shapes for all examples are 15 rows x 15 columns.\n\nAnd input grids are 3 rows x 3 columns apparently. But check E.g.1 Input: \"050\", \"555\", \"050\". So input grid is 3x3. E.g.2 Input: \"050\", \"550\", \"005\". E.g.3 Input: \"500\", \"050\", \"005\". And test input: \"050\", \"050\", \"505\". So input is 3x3.\n\nNow what is the transformation rule? Let's attempt to deduce.\n\nWe have three examples:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\nRow0: \"050\"\nRow1: \"555\"\nRow2: \"050\"\n\nOutput is 15 rows x 15 columns.\n\nObserving numbers: digits in input are '0' and '5'. Output has lots of zeros and fives. There is pattern: The output grid is larger than the input grid. It seems like a kind of \"blow-up\" where each cell in the input is replaced by a 5x5 block? That would yield 15x15 output if we start with 3x3 input. Because 3 * 5 = 15. Let's check: If we replace each input cell with a 5x5 block, then the top left cell of input (which is '0') becomes a 5x5 block of zeros. But in E.g. 1, top left block of output? Looking at row0 col0-4: \"00000\" but output row0 is \"000000050000000\". Actually, wait, let's check: The first 5 columns of row0 are \"00000\". But then column 5 is '0'? Actually, \"00000005\" is the first 7 columns. Let's check carefully: If each cell is replaced by a 5x5 block, then the first row of output should be:\nFor input cell (0,0) which is '0', block becomes row0: \"00000\" if zero replaced by zeros. But output row0: \"000000050000000\". That is 15 characters long. Let's segment: If I break row0 into 3 blocks of 5 columns each (since input has 3 columns): columns 0-4, 5-9, 10-14. \nFor E.g.1: row0: \"000000050000000\". Let's split into 3 blocks of 5 columns: block1: columns 0-4: \"00000\", block2: columns 5-9: \"00000\" but the digit in the middle column? Wait, \"00000005\" means first 7 digits \"0000000\", then \"5\", then \"000000\"? Let's actually count manually:\n\"000000050000000\"\nIndices: 0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:0, 8:5, 9:0, 10:0, 11:0, 12:0, 13:0, 14:0.\nSegment into 3 blocks of 5 columns: \nBlock1 (columns 0-4): \"00000\"\nBlock2 (columns 5-9): \"00005\"? Because columns 5-9 would be indices 5:0, 6:0, 7:0, 8:5, 9:0. So block2 becomes \"00005\".\nBlock3 (columns 10-14): \"00000\".\n\nNow what is input row0? \"050\". So the corresponding blocks should reflect the input digits, but we see for block1, input digit is 0 so block is \"00000\", that matches. For block2, input digit is 5, so block should be \"55555\", but we see \"00005\". For block3, input digit is 0, so block should be \"00000\", which matches. So not all blocks are uniform replication. So maybe transformation isn't simple replication.\n\nMaybe there is a pattern involving \"neighbors\" or \"mirroring\"? Let's compare with E.g.2:\n\nInput E.g.2:\nRow0: \"050\"\nRow1: \"550\"\nRow2: \"005\"\n\nOutput E.g.2:\nRow0: \"000000050000000\"\nRow1: \"000000550000000\"\nRow2: \"000000005000000\"\nRow3: \"000000555000000\"\nRow4: \"000000555000000\"\nRow5: \"000000555000000\"\nRow6: \"050555555000000\"\nRow7: \"550555555000000\"\nRow8: \"005555555000000\"\nRow9: \"000000000555050\"\nRow10: \"000000000555550\"\nRow11: \"000000000555005\"\nRow12: \"000000000050000\"\nRow13: \"000000000550000\"\nRow14: \"000000000005000\"\n\nSegment each row into 3 blocks of 5 columns maybe. Let's try to see pattern.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: Given a 3x3 input grid, output a 15x15 grid where each cell in the input grid is replaced by a pattern that is determined by the digit and its position relative to the center? And there might be additional decorations (extra rows/columns) around them? The outputs have extra rows at top and bottom and extra columns at left and right relative to the blocks?\n\nWait, let\u2019s inspect E.g", "prompt_tokens": 715, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check: Actually, \"0004442000000000\": the digits from position 3 to 5 are \"444\". Then \"2000000000\" starting at position 6? Actually, wait, let's count: \"0004442000000000\" is 16 digits. Characters at indices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:4,4:4,5:4,6:2, then zeros.\nRow 4: \"0004442008000000\": digits: probably similar pattern but last digit changed from \"0\" to \"800\" substitution? \nRow 5: \"0004442000000000\" same as row 3.\nRow 6: \"0000442000000000\": similar to row 2 but with one less \"4\"?

Let me re-read: \"0000442000000000\": count zeros: first 4 zeros, then \"4\", then \"4\", then \"200000000\"? Actually, wait, it's ambiguous. Let me re-read original text carefully. Possibly the transformation is about some connectivity or \"filling\" of a region.\n\nExample 1 output:\nRow 1: same as input.\nRow 2: \"0000042800000000\": notice that input row 2 had \"4\" and then \"2\" replaced by \"4\", \"2\", \"8\"? Actually, row 2 output is \"0000042800000000\". Compare with input row 2 \"0000042000000000\". There is an extra \"8\" appended to \"42\" becomes \"428\"? Similarly row 3: \"0004442888000000\" vs input row 3 \"0004442000000000\"? It changed \"2000000000\" to \"2888000000\". Row 4: \"0004442888000000\" vs input row 4 \"0004442008000000\"? It changed \"2008000000\" to \"2888000000\". Row 5: \"0004442888000000\" vs input row 5 \"0004442000000000\"? It changed \"2000000000\" to \"2888000000\". Row 6: \"0000442880000000\" vs input row 6 \"0000442000000000\"? It changed \"2000000000\" to \"2880000000\". Row 7: \"0000042800000000\" vs input row 7 \"0000042000000000\"? Changed \"2000000000\" to \"2800000000\". Then row 10: \"0000000000423000\" vs input row 10 \"0000000000420000\"; here \"2000\" became \"2300\"? Row 11: unchanged. Row 12: \"0000000440423033\" vs input row 12 \"0000000440420000\"; changed trailing \"0000\" to \"3033\". Row 13: \"0000000044020330\" vs input row 13 \"0000000044020000\"; changed trailing \"0000\" to \"3030\". Row 14: same.\n\nSo pattern seems: Some substitution of \"2\" with \"28\" or \"288\" or \"2888\"? Let\u2019s examine transitions.\n\nFocus on the region around the \"2\" digits. In input, there are clusters that look like \"4\", \"2\", \"4\". In output, those clusters become \"4\", \"2\", \"8\" pattern. But not exactly: row 2: \"42\" becomes \"428\". row 3: \"4442000000000\" becomes \"4442888000000\". So maybe rule: For every occurrence of \"2\" that is adjacent to a \"4\" in some pattern, replace with \"28\" or \"288\"? Wait, what's the pattern? Possibly the transformation is \"grow\" an area from a seed \"2\" using surrounding \"4\"s and then fill with \"8\" or \"3\". \n\nLet's check E.g. 1: The top cluster (rows 2 to 6) - The pattern \"4\" and \"2\" appear in the middle columns. In output, they get additional \"8\" appended. Also, note that in row 10, \"42\" becomes \"42\" then \"3000\"? Actually, row 10 in input: \"0000000000420000\", output becomes \"0000000000423000\". So the trailing \"2000\" turned into \"2300\". And row 12: \"0440420000\" becomes \"0440423033\". And row 13: \"0044020000\" becomes \"0044020330\".\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Replace the digit 2 with a pattern that is determined by its surroundings\"? Alternatively, maybe the transformation rule is: \"Shift some digits to the right and fill gaps with 8's or 3's\"? \nLet's look at E.g. 2.\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\nRows:\n1: \"0000000000000000\"\n2: \"0000002000400000\"\n3: \"0000002044040000\"\n4: \"0000002444400000\"\n5: \"0000002440000000\"\n6: \"0000502444000000\"\n7: \"0000002400000000\"\n8: \"0000000000000000\"\n9: \"0000000000000000\"\n10:\"0000000000000000\"\n11:\"0000000000000000\"\n12:\"0000420000000000\"\n13:\"0044420000000000\"\n14:\"4440420007000000\"\n15:\"0444020000000000\"\n16:\"0000000000000000\"\n\nE.g. 2 Output:\nRow1: \"0000000000000000\"\nRow2: \"0050002000400000\" (changed? \"2000400000\" becomes \"00500 2000400000\"?

There are 4 examples (E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, E.g. 4) and a Test Input (\"Test Input\" grid). We must deduce transformation rule from examples and apply to test input grid. Let's re-read the examples carefully.\n\nWe have 4 examples with input and output grids provided, and then a \"Test Input\" grid.\n\nLet's denote input as grid (rows, columns) in string form and output grid is another grid. We need to deduce transformation rule.\n\nLet's check examples: \n\nE.g. 1: \nGiven input grid lines:\n(There are 25 lines in E.g. 1 input as provided.)\nWe can assume they are 25 rows by 20 columns? Wait, let me check the E.g. 1 input: They are given as 25 lines (line count: count them). The user's provided E.g. 1 input: \n\"0007000070700000000\" is first line, then \"0000007770000000000\", etc. So each row is 20 columns wide. And there are 25 rows. Output also 25 rows by 20 columns.\n\nNow, transformation rules? Look at differences between input and output. Let's compare E.g. 1.\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nRow1: 0007000070700000000\nOutput row1: 0007000070700000600\n\nObservations: The last two digits changed from \"00\" to \"60\"? Actually, row1, columns: input row1: \"0007000070700000000\". Output row1: \"0007000070700000600\". The difference is at end columns? Let's index columns from left to right, 0-index. \nRow1: input: col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=7, col4=0, col5=0, col6=0, col7=7, col8=0, col9=7, col10=0, col11=0, col12=0, col13=0, col14=0, col15=0, col16=0, col17=0, col18=0, col19=0.\nOutput row1: \"0007000070700000600\": compare: col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=7, col4=0, col5=0, col6=0, col7=7, col8=0, col9=7, col10=0, col11=0, col12=0, col13=0, col14=0, col15=0, col16=0, col17=0, col18=6, col19=0. So difference: at col18, changed from 0 to 6, and col19 remains 0. Let's check row2:\nE.g. 1 row2: 0000007770000000000\nOutput row2: 0000007770000000200\nSo difference: last two digits: input last two were \"00\", output become \"20\". Row3:\nInput: 0070700000000000000\nOutput: 0070700000000000200\nDifference: last two digits \"00\" become \"20\".\nRow4:\nInput: 0700000000000000000\nOutput: 0700000000000000200\nDifference: last two digits \"00\" become \"20\".\nRow5:\nInput: 7000000777777000000\nOutput: 7000000777777000200\nDifference: change last two digits \"00\" to \"20\".\nRow6:\nInput: 0000000000000000000\nOutput: 0000000000000000200\nDifference: last two digits \"00\" become \"20\".\nRow7:\nInput: 0000700000000000000\nOutput: 0000700000000000200\nDifference: same, last two digits \"00\" become \"20\".\nRow8:\nInput: 0000070000077777000\nOutput: 0000070000077778200\nDifference: last two digits \"00\" become \"80\". Wait check: row8: input last two digits \"00\"? Actually row8: input ends with \"0077777000\", output ends with \"0077778200\". That means columns 18 and 19 changed from \"00\" to \"80\".\nRow9:\nInput: 0000000000000000000\nOutput: 0000000000000004300\nDifference: last three? Let's check: row9 input \"0000000000000000000\", output: \"0000000000000004300\". So columns 17-19 changed? Let's check: maybe it's \"0000000000000000000\" vs \"0000000000000004300\". The difference starting from col? Let's index: row9 input: 20 columns: position indices 0-19. Output row9: \"0000000000000004300\". So likely columns 17-19 changed: \"000\" to \"430\"? Wait, but length is 20 characters, so \"0000000000000000000\" vs \"0000000000000004300\". Let's compare digit by digit:\nIndices: \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 for input row9.\nFor output row9: \"0000000000000004300\": digits: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3,0,0.\nSo the change is at indices 16, 17, 18 maybe? Let's check: index 16: from 0 to 4, index 17: 0 to 3, index 18: 0 to 0, index 19: 0 to 0. But then row10:\nInput row10: \"0000000700007070000\"\nOutput row10: \"0000000700007082000\"\nDifference: last two digits: \"00\" become \"80\"? Actually row10: \"0707070000\" part? Let's check carefully: row10 input: \"0000000700007070000\". Output row10: \"0000000700007082000\". So difference: the \"07\" sequence? Possibly same pattern.\n\nLet's check row11:\nInput: \"7007000000000000070\"\nOutput: \"7007000000000043070\"\nDifference: looks like the middle digits changed: \"0000000000\" vs \"0430\"? Wait, let's check row11 carefully:\nInput row11: \"7007000000000000070\"\nCount columns: It is 20 characters. Let's index them: \nIndices: \n0:7,1:0,2:0,3:7,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:0,17:7,18:0.\nOutput row11: \"7007000000000043070\"\nSo differences: in output, apparently indices 14-16 maybe changed: \"000\" becomes \"430\"? Let's check: output row11: maybe indices 14-16: \"430\"? But then then index 17 becomes 7, index 18 becomes 0, index 19 becomes ? Actually wait, let's count exactly: row11 output: \"7007000000000043070\". Count digits: \n0:7,1:0,2:0,3:7,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:0,13:0,14:4,15:3,16:0,17:7,18:0,19:70? Actually need to re-read. Let's re-read row11 output: \"7007000000000043070\". It is 20 characters. Let's index: \nIndices: \n0:7, \n1:0, \n2:0, \n3:7, \n4:0, \n5:0, \n6:0, \n7:0, \n8:0, \n9:0, \n10:0, \n11:0, \n12:0, \n13:0, \n14:4, \n15:3, \n16:0, \n17:7, \n18:0, \n19:70? That doesn't look right, there should be 20 digits. Let's re-read string: \"7007000000000043070\". Count: \n\"7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 3 0 7 0\". That is 19 digits! We expect 20. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nLet's count carefully: \"7007000000000043070\". Write indices:\nIndex: 0: '7'\n1: '0'\n2: '0'\n3: '7'\n4: '0'\n5: '0'\n6: '0'\n7: '0'\n8: '0'\n9: '0'\n10:", "prompt_tokens": 2307, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Output: \"001010011011\". (No change.)\nRow 2: Input: \"101011011101\". Output: \"101011011101\". (No change.)\nRow 3: Input: \"100030010000\". Output: \"100030010000\". (No change)\nRow 4: Input: \"001313000000\". Output: \"001383000000\". Difference: \"001313000000\" to \"001383000000\". It changed the digit '1' to '8'? Let's check: The string \"001313000000\": positions: index 0: '0', index1:'0', index2:'1', index3:'3', index4:'1', index5:'3', index6:'0', index7:'0', index8:'0', index9:'0', index10:'0', index11:'0'. And output \"001383000000\": positions: index0:'0', index1:'0', index2:'1', index3:'3', index4:'8', index5:'3', rest same. So replaced digit at index 4 from '1' to '8'. But wait, how many differences? Let's check row 5: Input: \"103111301010\", Output: \"103888301010\". So changed \"103111301010\" to \"103888301010\", so the block from index? Let's check indices: \"103111301010\" with digits: index0: '1', index1: '0', index2: '3', index3: '1', index4: '1', index5: '1', index6: '3', index7: '0', index8: '1', index9: '0', index10: '1', index11: '0'? I'll re-read the strings carefully.\n\nWait, let me re-read the rows exactly as provided:\n\nE.g. 1:\nRow1: \"001010011011\"\nRow2: \"101011011101\"\nRow3: \"100030010000\"\nRow4: \"001313000000\"\nRow5: \"103111301010\"\nRow6: \"110110011010\"\nRow7: \"110100011000\"\nRow8: \"001110101000\"\nRow9: \"000003010000\"\nRow10: \"000030301010\"\nRow11: \"000310110010\"\nRow12: \"103101001001\"\nRow13: \"001010100101\"\n\nNow outputs:\nRow1: same as input.\nRow2: same as input.\nRow3: same as input.\nRow4: \"001383000000\"\nRow5: \"103888301010\"\nRow6: same as input.\nRow7: same as input.\nRow8: same as input.\nRow9: same as input.\nRow10: \"000038301010\"\nRow11: \"000388880010\"\nRow12: \"103888888001\"\nRow13: same as input.\n\nObserving pattern: In rows 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, modifications occur, but rows 1,2,3,6,7,8,9,13 remain unchanged. Let's check positions in these rows. In row 4, the input \"001313000000\" becomes \"001383000000\". The only change is at the 5th digit (0-indexed index 4) changed from '1' to '8'. In row 5, input \"103111301010\" becomes \"103888301010\". Compare: \"103111301010\" vs \"103888301010\". They differ in the block from index 3 to index 6 maybe? Let's check index by index:\nIndex0: '1' vs '1' same.\nIndex1: '0' vs '0' same.\nIndex2: '3' vs '3' same.\nIndex3: '1' vs '8' changed.\nIndex4: '1' vs '8' changed.\nIndex5: '1' vs '8' changed.\nIndex6: '3' vs '3'? Actually in input row5: \"103111301010\", index6 is '3'? Wait, let me re-read row5 input: \"103111301010\". \nIndex0: '1'\nIndex1: '0'\nIndex2: '3'\nIndex3: '1'\nIndex4: '1'\nIndex5: '1'\nIndex6: '3'\nIndex7: '0'\nIndex8: '1'\nIndex9: '0'\nIndex10: '1'\nIndex11: '0'\nNow row5 output: \"103888301010\".\nIndex0: '1'\nIndex1: '0'\nIndex2: '3'\nIndex3: '8'\nIndex4: '8'\nIndex5: '8'\nIndex6: '3'\nSo it seems the substring from index3 to index5 (three digits) changed from \"111\" to \"888\". And then remaining part remains same.\n\nRow10: Input \"000030301010\" becomes \"000038301010\". Compare: They are identical except index? Let's align:\nInput row10: \"000030301010\"\nOutput row10: \"000038301010\"\nSo difference: \"000030301010\" vs \"000038301010\", check: digits:\nIndex0: '0' same,\nIndex1: '0' same,\nIndex2: '0' same,\nIndex3: '0' same,\nIndex4: '3' same,\nIndex5: '0' same,\nIndex6: '3' same,\nIndex7: '0' vs '8'? Wait, let's check carefully:\nMaybe I misaligned. Write them with indices:\nRow10 input: characters: 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 1 0 1 0? Wait, length: \"000030301010\" length is 12. Let's index:\nIndex0: 0\nIndex1: 0\nIndex2: 0\nIndex3: 0\nIndex4: 3\nIndex5: 0\nIndex6: 3\nIndex7: 0\nIndex8: 1\nIndex9: 0\nIndex10: 1\nIndex11: 0\nRow10 output: \"000038301010\":\nIndex0: 0\nIndex1: 0\nIndex2: 0\nIndex3: 0\nIndex4: 3\nIndex5: 8\nIndex6: 3\nIndex7: 0\nIndex8: 1\nIndex9: 0\nIndex10: 1\nIndex11: 0\nSo difference: index5 changed from '0' to '8'. But wait row 4 difference was index4 changed from '1' to '8'. So pattern is not uniform.\n\nRow11: Input \"000310110010\" becomes \"000388880010\". Let's index:\nRow11 input: digits: \"000310110010\"\nIndices: 0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:3, 4:1, 5:0, 6:1, 7:1, 8:0, 9:0, 10:1, 11:0.\nRow11 output: \"000388880010\"\nIndices: 0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:3, 4:8, 5:8, 6:8, 7:8, 8:0, 9:0, 10:1, 11:0.\nSo the difference: indices 4,5,6,7 changed from \"1101\"? Let's check: In input, indices 4-7: \"1011\"? Wait recalc: Actually input row11: \"000310110010\". Let's index properly:\n\n\"000310110010\"\nDigit indices:\n0: 0\n1: 0\n2: 0\n3: 3\n4: 1\n5: 0\n6: 1\n7: 1\n8: 0\n9: 0\n10:1\n11:0\n\nOutput row11: \"000388880010\"\nIndices:\n0: 0\n1: 0\n2: 0\n3", "prompt_tokens": 1016, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Count digits: It might be 36 digits? Actually, count: the line \"111111111111111111111111111111\" - count 36 digits? Let's count: It might be 36 digits if length is \"36\"? We'll check length: \"111111111111111111111111111111\" count:\n\"1\" repeated? Let's count: \"111111111111111111111111111111\" I'll count manually: It might be 36 digits if each group is 4 digits? Actually, we can count: \"111111111111111111111111111111\" I'll count: It might be easier: groups: \"1111111111\" is 10 digits but not sure. Let's count carefully:\n\nBetter: The \"E.g. 1\" input lines: They are 18 rows, each row length? For \"1111111111111111111\" has 19 digits. Actually, let's check e.g. 1 input: \"1111111111111111111\". Count: 19 digits. But then second line \"1000011000011000011\" is 19 digits. So all rows in e.g. 1 are 19 digits. In e.g. 2: first row \"11111111111111111111111\" is 21 digits. e.g. 3: first row \"1111111111111111111111111\" is 25 digits. So maybe test input is similar to e.g. 1? Wait, test input first row length: \"111111111111111111111111111111\". Count digits: 36? Let's count digits: I'll count manually: \nRow 1: \"111111111111111111111111111111\" \nI can count groups: The row appears to be 36 digits if each group is \"1111\" repeated 9 times gives 36 digits. Let me check: 9*4 = 36. Yes.\n\nSo test input rows: There are 31 rows.\n\nNow, pattern of test input: They are composed of repeating blocks of pattern similar to e.g. 1, but with extra columns? Compare e.g. 1 input: It is 18 rows with pattern: 5 rows top, 4 rows in the middle, etc. Actually, e.g. 1 input: rows 1-5: 1st row is border, then 2nd-5th rows are similar shape, then row 6 is border, etc. Let's analyze e.g. 1 input:\n- Row 1: border: \"1111111111111111111\" (19 digits all 1's)\n- Row 2: \"1000011000011000011\": pattern: left 1, then maybe 4 zeros, then 1, then 4 zeros, then 1, then 4 zeros, then 1. Actually pattern: 1, then 4 zeros, 1, then 4 zeros, 1, then 4 zeros, 1. That sums to 1+4+1+4+1+4+1 = 16? But actually 1+4+1+4+1+4+1 = 16, but row length is 19 digits, so maybe it's 1, then 4 zeros, then 1, then 4 zeros, then 1, then 4 zeros, then 1, then 4 zeros, then 1? Let's recalc: 1 + 4 = 5, +1=6, +4=10, +1=11, +4=15, +1=16, +4=20. That doesn't match. Let's recalc properly: \"1000011000011000011\". Count digits: There are 19 digits. Positions: index 1: 1, index2:0, index3:0, index4:0, index5:0, index6:1, index7:1? Wait, let's check carefully: The string \"1000011000011000011\" if we group: It might be 1, then 4 zeros, then 1, then 1? Wait, let's count: I'll index: \nDigit positions:\n1: '1'\n2: '0'\n3: '0'\n4: '0'\n5: '0'\n6: '1'\n7: '1'? Let's read string: \"1000011000011000011\"\nBetter: Count characters by splitting: It might be easier to count digits: There are 19 digits because the border row had 19 digits. So each row is 19 digits. Let's count: position 1:1, 2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:1,7:1,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:1,13:1,14:0,15:0,16:0,17:0,18:1,19:1? That doesn't add up because last two digits are \"11\"? Actually, check: \"1000011000011000011\"\nI can try to split: It might be structured as:\n\"1 0000 1 0000 1 0000 1\" but that would be 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 16, which is not 19.\nMaybe it's \"1 0000 1 0000 1 0000 1\" with some extra digits? Possibly it's \"1 0000 1 0000 1 0000 1\" equals 1+4+1+4+1+4+1 = 16, to get 19 digits, you need 3 extra ones at the end, so pattern: \"1 0000 1 0000 1 0000 1 0000 1\"? That would yield 1+4+1+4+1+4+1+4+1 = 21 digits, too many.\nMaybe it's \"1 0000 1 0000 1 0000 1\" but then with extra \"11\" at the end gives 16+2 = 18, still not 19?\nWait, I need to re-read e.g. 1 input: \"1111111111111111111", "prompt_tokens": 1969, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Possibly the nonzero numbers in input are \"4\", \"0\", \"0\", etc. But wait, let me re-read each input and output to see pattern.\n\nLet's first denote positions in input grid as coordinates (row, col) with row index 0 to 2 and col index 0 to 2. The output grid is 9x9. I'm thinking that the rule might be: \"Place the input grid's pattern in a 3x3 arrangement repeated in a larger grid\" maybe with some modifications.\n\nI see that each output grid has a pattern that is symmetric. It appears to be a kind of \"blurring\" or \"repeating\" pattern.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"For each cell in the output, determine its value by computing Manhattan distance from the nearest nonzero cell in the input?\" Possibly a thickening or dilation pattern.\n\nLet's analyze Example 1 in detail:\nInput 1: \nRow0: [0,0,0]\nRow1: [0,4,0]\nRow2: [0,0,0]\n\nNonzero element: only one nonzero: the center cell of the 3x3 grid has value 4.\n\nOutput 1:\nRow0: 404444444\nRow1: 404000004\nRow3: 404044404\nRow4: 404040404\nRow5: 404040404\nRow6: 404000404\nRow7: 404444404\nRow8: 400000004\nRow9: 444444444\n\nLet's denote coordinates in output? More precisely, output grid is 9x9. Possibly the transformation is \"propagate\" the nonzero cell value outward with some pattern? Perhaps the output grid is constructed by taking the input cell (which is 4 in center) and \"blowing it up\" to fill the corners with some numbers, while the zeros become something else.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: \"Expand the input grid by replicating it 3 times in both dimensions, and then perform a 'complement' operation on each cell: if the corresponding cell in the original input was 0, then fill with the input's non-zero digit in the border, and if it was non-zero, then fill with that digit in the border? Not sure.\n\nI see the output of Example 1: The middle row of output is \"404000004\". The pattern \"404\" appears in several rows. In fact, row0 has \"404444444\". The pattern \"404\" appears multiple times. Similarly, in Example 2, where input had one non-zero digit \"5\" for row1 column0? Let's check Example 2 input:\nRow0: 000\nRow1: 500\nRow2: 000\nSo only non-zero is row1 col0 equals 5.\nOutput row1: \"555550505\". The pattern \"5555\" then \"0\" then \"505\" maybe.\nWait, let's inspect row1 of Example 2: \"555550505\"\nIt starts with \"5555\", then \"0\", then \"505\". That doesn't look like a replication of 3x3 grid.\n\nMaybe the transformation is \"take the input grid, and then surround it with a border of its own pattern, then repeat?\" Possibly a fractal rule: \"Place the input grid in the center of a 9x9 grid, then for every cell in the 9x9 grid, if its Manhattan distance from the center is even, then output the digit from the input grid cell corresponding to the center of the subgrid, and if odd, then output the complement digit\" but that doesn't match.\n\nWait, let's compare Example 1 and Example 2. They are similar in structure except the non-zero value is different and positions are different. In Example 1, the nonzero was in the center (1,1) and it's 4. In Example 2, the nonzero is in the top left corner? Actually, Example 2: Row1: \"500\" means that row1, col0 is 5, and the rest are zeros.\nNow look at output Example 2:\nRow1: \"555550505\". The first five digits are 5, then 0, then 505.\nRow7: \"555550505\" again. Row0: \"555550505\" as well? Let's re-read Example 2 output rows:\n\nRow0: \"555550505\"\nRow1: \"000050505\"\nRow2: \"555050505\"\nRow3: \"505050505\"\nRow4: \"505050505\"\nRow5: \"005050505\"\nRow6: \"555050505\"\nRow7: \"000050505\"\nRow8: \"555550505\"\nSo pattern: The nonzero digit 5 appears in a pattern that seems to radiate outward from the location of the input nonzero (which is at row1, col0).\nWait, which coordinate in output corresponds to the input nonzero? Possibly the input grid is conceptually placed in the center of the output grid? Let's check Example 1: input nonzero at (1,1) becomes output? The center of the output grid (which is 9x9) is row4, col4. And indeed, in Example 1 output, row4 col4 equals \"0\" but row? Actually, check row? Wait, let's check Example 1: the only nonzero in input is (1,1)=4. In output, I see the digit \"4\" appears in many places. Perhaps the rule is: \"Take the input grid and expand it by copying it into a 3x3 block pattern, then fill the rest with a pattern based on the distance of each cell from that block.\" Perhaps the transformation is like a \"pattern replication\" where the input grid is considered as a \"seed\" and then a \"flood fill\" is done outward from the seed to fill the entire 9x9 grid.\n\nWait, let's observe the pattern in Example 1:\nThe output grid has a border of 4's around, and then an inner cross of zeros. Let\u2019s try to see coordinates:\nCoordinates in output for Example 1, if I set origin at top-left (0,0) and bottom-right (8,8):\nI see that the output's corners are 4's: top row: starts 404444444, row0 col0=4, row0 col1=0, row0 col2=4, then 444444? Not exactly.\n\nMaybe the idea is to use a 3x3 \"template\" pattern that is repeated in a 3x3 grid to form a 9x9 grid. For Example 1,", "prompt_tokens": 665, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The transformation rule is hidden. We need to deduce transformation rule from the examples provided.\n\nLet's read examples:\n\nWe have provided examples:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput:\n```\n044466666\n040460006\n044460006\n000066666\n```\nOutput:\n```\n400\n666\n666\n```\nWait, check input and output dimensions: The given example e.g. 1 input is lines: \"044466666\", \"040460006\", \"044460006\", \"000066666\". That is 4 rows x 9 columns? But output is \"400\", \"666\", \"666\", that is 3 rows x 3 columns. So the transformation reduces the grid. Similarly, e.g. 2 input:\n```\n777000000\n707708888\n700708008\n777708888\n```\nOutput:\n```\n777\n880\n000\n```\nWait: The output is 3 rows x 3 columns. e.g. 3:\n```\n999905555\n900905005\n990905055\n099905550\n```\nOutput:\n```\n999\n555\n000\n```\nSo output is 3 rows x 3 columns.\ne.g. 4:\n```\n333301110\n300301010\n300301010\n333301110\n```\nOutput:\n```\n333\n300\n110\n```\ne.g. 5:\n```\n888066600\n808060600\n888066600\n000000000\n```\nOutput:\n```\n800\n600\n000\n```\ne.g. 6:\n```\n777088800\n707080880\n707080080\n777088880\n```\nOutput:\n```\n770\n888\n000\n```\nTest Input:\n```\n444000777\n404440707\n400040777\n444440000\n```\nThe output is supposed to be a 3x3 grid.\n\nI need to find transformation rule from examples.\n\nObserving pattern: The examples are all transformation from a 4 row by 9 column grid to a 3 row by 3 column grid. So likely the rule is to extract a submatrix from the input grid, maybe the central 3x3. But the examples do not always have the same pattern.\n\nLet's analyze each example's input and output coordinates.\n\nFor e.g. 1:\nInput:\nRow0: 0 4 4 4 6 6 6 6 6\nRow1: 0 4 0 4 4 6 0 0 6\nRow2: 0 4 4 4 6 0 0 6\nRow3: 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6\n\nOutput:\nRow0: 4 0 0\nRow1: 6 6 6\nRow2: 6 6 6\n\nObserving relation, maybe the output is extracted from the input by taking the 3x3 block that is \"central\", i.e. rows 1-3, columns 1-3 maybe? Let's check coordinates: if we take rows 1,2,3 and columns 1,2,3, then for e.g. 1:\nRow1: columns 1-3: (4,0,4) not equals output row0 \"400\". That doesn't match.\nMaybe it's rows 0-2 and columns 0-2? For e.g. 1: \nRow0 columns 0-2: (0,4,4) but output row0 is \"400\". Not matching.\n\nMaybe it's taking the extreme corners of the grid? \nMaybe rule is to \"sum along diagonals\"? \n\nLet's check e.g. 1: output: \"400\", \"666\", \"666\". There is pattern: The first row of output is \"400\". In the input, maybe there is a \"4\" in some position that becomes the leftmost of row1 output? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: Given a 4x9 grid, pick the outer border, then sum the numbers? \nWait, check dimensions: The output grid is 3x3. Possibly the rule is: For each cell in the output, its value is determined by the \"glue\" of some region of the input. Possibly the rule is: Output cell at row i, col j equals the value from input's cell at row 2*i, col 3*j+? \nNot sure.\n\nLet's compare the examples carefully.\n\nI suspect the rule might be: \"take the four corners of the input grid and sum them, then take the center 3x3 subgrid of the input\" but then check e.g. 1: if I take the center 3x3 subgrid (rows 1-3, columns 1-3), that gives:\nRow1: columns 1-3: 4,0,4 -> \"404\"\nRow2: columns 1-3: 4,4,6 -> \"446\" but output row1 is \"666\".\nNot that.\n\nMaybe rule is: \"the output grid is the result of applying a filter that sums the four corners of each 2x2 block\" but then check e.g. 1:\nConsider breaking the input into 3x3 overlapping 2x2 blocks horizontally and vertically. For instance, if we consider top-left block? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to sum all numbers in each quadrant and then produce a new 3x3 grid with each cell being the sum mod something? But then e.g. 1: top-left output \"400\" is not sum.\n\nLet's try to inspect e.g. 2:\nInput:\nRow0: 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 7 0 7 7 0 8 8 8 8\nRow2: 7 0 0 7 0 8 0 0 8\nRow3: 7 7 7 7 0 8 8 8 8\n\nOutput: \nRow0: 7 7 7\nRow1: 8 8 0\nRow2: 0 0 0\n\nObserving output row0 equals the first row of input? Actually input row0 is \"777000000\", and output row0 is \"777\". So maybe the output takes the top row as is, but only keep the first three columns? But then e.g. 3: \nInput row0: 999905555, output row0: \"999\". That fits: first three digits of row0 are \"999\". For e.g. 2, row0: first three digits \"777\". For e.g. 3, row0: first three digits \"999\". For e.g. 4, row0: \"333301110\", output row0: \"333\". That is first three digits are \"333\" but then row0 of input is \"333301110\", first three digits \"333\". For e.g. 5, row0: \"888066600\", output row0: \"800\". Not the same though: first three digits of row0 are \"888\", but output row0 is \"800\". For e.g. 6, row0: \"777088800\", output row0: \"770\". That is not simply the first three digits, because first three digits of row0 are \"777\", but output row0 is \"770\".\n\nMaybe rule is: Output row0 equals input row0's first three digits, except then sometimes changed? Let's check e.g. 1 row0: input row0 \"044466666\", output row0 \"400\". The first three digits of row0 are \"044\", not \"400\". So that doesn't hold.\n\nMaybe rule: Output row0 equals input row0's corner digits? For e.g. 1, row0: \"044466666\", maybe we take the first, middle, and last of row0? That would be 0,4,6? But output row0 is \"400\". That doesn't match.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"For each output cell, look at the corresponding 2x2 square in the input, and then take a majority vote or maybe a specific corner?\" For e.g. 1, consider coordinates mapping: The output grid is 3x3, so we can think of it as indices (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), etc. And then maybe the rule is: Each output cell equals the input cell that is diagonally opposite to the corresponding corner of a 2x2 block? Let's try to see: For e.g. 1, if we partition the input into overlapping 2x2 blocks? The input is 4x9, output is 3x3. Possibly the transformation is: Output cell at (i, j) equals input cell at (2*i, 3*j)? That might work for e.g. 1: For output (0,0), that would be input (0,0)? That gives 0, but output (0,0) is 4. Not that.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Take the four corner cells of the input and sum them, then place that sum in the center of the output\"? But then e.g. 1: corners of input: top-left: 0, top-right: 6, bottom-left: 0, bottom-right: 6, sum=12, but output center is 6 according to \"666\", not 12. \n\nMaybe rule is:", "prompt_tokens": 611, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Actually, I'll re-read the given text carefully:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n000000000000000\n022222222000000\n021222222000000\n022222222000000\n022222222000000\n022222222000000\n022222222000000\n022222222000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n000000000000000\n022222222000000\n021000012000000\n020100102000000\n020011002000000\n020100102000000\n021000012000000\n022222222000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n\nObserving pattern: The only differences are in rows 1 through 7 maybe.\n\nLet's index rows from 0 to 11. The input vs output differences:\nRow0: identical.\nRow1: input: 022222222000000, output: 022222222000000, so row1 is unchanged.\nRow2: input: 021222222000000, output: 021000012000000. So digits changed? Let's mark positions:\n\nRow2, input: \"021222222000000\". Output: \"021000012000000\".\nComparing them digit by digit:\n- Index0: '0' same.\n- Index1: '2' same.\n- Index2: input '1' vs output '1'? Actually, row2 index2: input is '1'? Let me re-read: row2: \"021222222000000\"\nWait, I'm going to align:\nRow2 input: characters: \n0: '0'\n1: '2'\n2: '1'\n3: '2'\n4: '2'\n5: '2'\n6: '2'\n7: '2'\n8: '2'\n9: '2'\n10: '0'\n11: '0'\n12: '0'\n13: '0'\n14: '0'\n15: '0'? Wait length: \"021222222000000\" is 15 characters? But row0 had 15 characters? Actually, they said 12x12 grid, but the strings seem 15 characters long. Possibly they are 15 columns wide. Let me count: \"000000000000000\" is 15 zeros. So grid size is 15 columns by 12 rows.\nNow row2: \"021222222000000\" is 15 characters.\nRow2 output: \"021000012000000\". Compare difference: index2: input '1' vs output '1'? Actually, index2 is same.\nBut then index3: input '2' vs output '0'? Actually, let's align carefully:\nPositions: \n- Index0: 0 vs 0\n- Index1: 2 vs 2\n- Index2: 1 vs 1 (so far so good)\n- Index3: input: '2' vs output: '0'\n- Index4: input: '2' vs output: '0'\n- Index5: input: '2' vs output: '0'? Let's check: Actually, output row2: \"021000012000000\". So breakdown: characters: '0','2','1','0','0','0','0','1','2','0','0','0','0','0','0'? I need to count: \"021000012000000\" count:\n0: 0\n1: 2\n2: 1\n3: 0\n4: 0\n5: 0\n6: 0\n7: 1\n8: 2\n9: 0\n10: 0\n11: 0\n12: 0\n13: 0\n14: 0\n\nSo differences:\nIndex3, input '2', output '0'\nIndex4, input '2', output '0'\nIndex5, input '2', output '0'\nIndex6, input '2', output '0'\nIndex7, input '2', output '1'\nIndex8, input '2', output '2'\nIndex9, input '0', output '0'\nIndex10, input '0', output '0'\nIndex11, input '0', output '0'\nIndex12, input '0', output '0'\nIndex13, input '0', output '0'\nIndex14, input '0', output '0'\n\nSo the changes: the region \"22222\" (5 digits) becomes \"00001\" in output? Actually, check: input substring from index3 to index7 is \"2222\"? Wait, let's re-read: Actually, from index3 to index7: input digits: index3: '2', index4: '2', index5: '2', index6: '2'; output digits: index3: '0', index4: '0', index5: '0', index6: '0', then index7: '1'. So it becomes \"0001\". But wait, what happened to the digit at index8? In input, index8 is '2' and output index8 is '2'. So overall difference from row2 is: \"2222\" becomes \"0001\" then '2' remains same.\n\nWhat about row3: input: \"022222222000000\" vs output: \"020100102000000\". Let's compare:\n- index0: 0 vs 0\n- index1: 2 vs 2\n- index2: 2 vs 0? Actually, output row3: \"020100102000000\"\nLet's align: row3 input: \"022222222000000\"\nRow3 output: \"020100102000000\"\n\nIndices:\n0: input '0' output '0'\n1: input '2' output '2'\n2: input '2' output '0'\n3: input '2' output '1'\n4: input '2' output '0'\n5: input '2' output '0'\n6: input '2' output '1'\n7: input '2' output '0'\n8: input '2' output '2'\n9: input '2' output '0'\n10: input '0' output '0'\n11: input '0' output '0'\n12: input '0' output '0'\n13: input '0' output '0'\n14: input '0' output '0'\n\nSo row3: substring changed indices 2 to 8: \"2222222\" becomes \"0100102\". Row2 changed substring indices 3 to 8: \"22222\" -> \"00001\" maybe? Let's re-check row2: Actually, row2: \"021222222000000\" becomes \"021000012000000\". So the block that changed spans indices 3 to 7 or 3 to 8? Let's re-check row2 carefully: row2: \"0 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\" and output row2: \"0 2 1 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So the modified block is indices 3 to 7: originally \"2222\" becomes \"0000\", and index7 changes from '2' to '1'? But that means length 5 digits? Let's recalc: row2 input: indices: \n0:0, 1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 4:2, 5:2, 6:2, 7:2, 8:2 then rest zeros.\nRow2 output: \n0:0, 1:2, 2:1, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:1, 8:2.\nSo the block from index3 to index7: \"2222\" is replaced by \"0001\", but that is 4 digits replaced with 4 digits? Actually, \"2222\" is 4 digits, and \"0001\" is 4 digits. But wait, let me check: 3->7 is 5 positions? Because positions: 3,4,5,6,7: that's 5 digits. Let's recount: index3,4,5,6,7: that's 5 positions. And in row2, the substring from index3 to index7: index3: '2', index4: '2', index5", "prompt_tokens": 1130, "completion_tokens": 2048}

From the provided examples, we need to analyze the transformation rule. Let me check each example and deduce rule.\n\nI'll try to summarize each transformation:\n\nObserving examples:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n```\n0000000000000000000\n0088888888880000000\n0087777777780222222\n0087777777780211112\n0087744447780213312\n0087743347780213312\n0087743347780211112\n0087743347780222222\n0087743347780000000\n0087743347780000000\n0087744447780000000\n0087777777780000000\n0087777777780000000\n0088888888880000000\n0000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000\n```\nE.g. 1 Output:\n```\n0000000000000000000\n0033333333330000000\n0034444444430333333\n0034444444430311113\n0034477774430312213\n0034478874430312213\n0034478874430311113\n0034478874430333333\n0034478874430000000\n0034478874430000000\n0034477774430000000\n0034444444430000000\n0034444444430000000\n0033333333330000000\n0000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000\n```\n\nObservations: The transformation seems to take the input pattern and \"shift\" some values. Let's look carefully.\n\nE.g. 1: Input has two parts: top half with some pattern of digits '0','8','7','4' etc, bottom half with zeros. Output changed them to 0 to 3 numbers. Look at boundaries: In the first row of output, it's the same as input: \"0000000000000000000\". In the second row of output, we see \"0033333333330000000\" in output, but input second row was \"0088888888880000000\". So transformation: 8 becomes 3 in second row? But then on third row, input \"0087777777780222222\" becomes \"0034444444430333333\". So it seems: The transformation might be a rotation of digits? Wait, let's check pattern: In E.g. 1 Output, the digits on the left part changed from 0 to 0 obviously, but the center digits: \"8888\" become \"3333\"? But we need to compare positions carefully.\n\nI must determine mapping. Let's denote row indices. Let grid be coordinate system with rows and columns. The transformation rule is applied to each cell? Possibly it's about symmetry? Look at dimensions. Each example grid is 20x20? Actually, count: E.g. 1 input: 20 rows of 20 columns? Actually, there are 20 rows, each row is 20 characters. But then output also 20 rows x 20 columns. But then E.g. 2: There are 20 rows x 20 columns? Wait, no, example 2 input: There are 19 rows? Let's check: Provided E.g. 2 input lines:\n```\n0000000000000000  -- length 16?\n0000000000000000\n0011111111111100\n0011111111111100\n0011333333331100\n0011388888831100\n0011388888831100\n0011388228831100\n0011388228831100\n0011388888831100\n0011388888831100\n0011333333331100\n0011111111111100\n0011111111111100\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n0000000000000000\n```\nWait, careful: The given input lines for E.g. 2: They are \nLine1: \"0000000000000000\" (16 length)\nLine2: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine3: \"0011111111111100\"\n...\nLine16: \"0000000000000000\"\n\nSo E.g. 2 grid is 16x16. E.g. 3: input grid: \n```\n88888800000000000  (15 length? Actually count: \"88888800000000000\" length is 17? Let's count: \"888888\" is 6, then \"00000000000000000\" is 14, so total 20? Actually, let me check: \"88888800000000000\" count digits: 6+14=20?) Wait, check: \"888888\" (6 digits) plus \"00000000000000000\" (14 digits) equals 20, but 6+14=20. But then the next line: \"82222800000000000\": count digits: 6+14=20, yes.\nSo E.g. 3 grid is 16 rows? Let's count: lines: \n1: \"88888800000000000\"\n2: \"82222800000000000\"\n3: \"82112800000000000\"\n4: \"82112800000000000\"\n5: \"82222800000000000\"\n6: \"88888800000000000\"\n7: \"00000000000000000\"\n8: \"00006666666666660\"\n9: \"00006333333333360\"\n10: \"00006344444444360\"\n11: \"00006342222224360\"\n12: \"00006342111124360\"\n13: \"00006342111124360\"\n14: \"00006342222224360\"\n15: \"00006344444444360\"\n16: \"00006333333333360\"\n17: \"00006666666666660\"\n\nSo E.g. 3 grid is 17 rows by 20 columns. E.g. 4 grid: input lines count: \n```\n0001111111110000000  (20 columns)\n0001111111110000000\n0001166666110000000\n0001168886110000000\n0001166666110000000\n0001111111110000000\n0001111111110000000\n0000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000\n0222222222222000000\n0244444444442000000\n0241111111142000000\n0241888888142000000\n0241888888142000000\n0241111111142000000\n0244444444442000000\n0222222222222000000\n```\nCount rows: count: 18 rows, each row length 20.\n\nE.g. 4 output: 18 rows of 20 columns.\n\nSo grids sizes vary. So the transformation is not simply a rotation by 180 degrees? Let's check patterns:\n\nOne common pattern across examples: The output seems to swap the left and right halves? But not exactly. Let's check E.g. 1: Compare input and output row by row. In E.g. 1, row1: input \"0000000000000000000\"; output \"0000000000000000000\" same. Row2: input \"0088888888880000000\", output \"0033333333330000000\". So the leftmost digit remains \"0\", then the inside digits \"8888888888\" become \"3333333333\", then the ending \"0000000\" stays \"0000000\". So looks like the transformation is that the central region digits are replaced by their complement relative to 9? Because 8 becomes 1? But 8+? Let's check: 8 becomes 3, 7 becomes 4? Wait, 8 -> 3, 7 -> 4, 4 -> 7, 3 -> 8? Let's check row2: 8 -> 3. Row3: input \"0087777777780222222\", output \"0034444444430333333\". Let's map digits: The left part \"0\" remains \"0\". Then \"8777777778\" becomes \"3444444443\". So mapping: 8 -> 3, 7 -> 4, then \"0222222\" becomes \"0333333\". So it appears that in the output, the digit d becomes: if d=8 then output becomes 3? if d=7 then 4? if d=4 then? Wait, check row4: input \"0087744447780213312\", output \"0034477774430312213\". Let's map:\n- \"0\" remains \"0\"\n- \"8774\" becomes \"3447\" maybe?\nMapping: 8 -> 3, 7 -> 4, 4 -> 7, then \"4444\" becomes \"7777\", then \"7780\" becomes \"7430\"? Let's check carefully row4 mapping:\nInput row4: \"0087744447780213312\"\nBreak it: \"0\" then \"8774\" then \"4444\" then \"7780\" then \"21312\"? Not sure.\n\nLet's align columns: Both input and output have same structure: They are symmetric vertically? There appears to be a reflection about the vertical center line: Left half is replaced by something like (9 - original digit)? But 8 -> 1? But output", "prompt_tokens": 1645, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Apply this rule to the final test input grid.\"\n\nThen \"E.g. 1 Input:\" and then we see:\n\n990\n009\n090\n\nBut wait, it says \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then \"990\" then \"009\" then \"090\". That is exactly three rows. But the output lines are 9 lines. So it seems that the transformation takes a 3x3 grid and produces a 9x9 grid? Let's check.\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n000000009\n000000990\n000000909\n009009000\n990990000\n909909000\n009000009\n990000990\n909000909\n\nYes, indeed, the output is 9 rows, each row 9 columns. So perhaps the transformation is: given a grid of dimension 3x3, output a grid of dimension 9x9 with a pattern that uses the input pattern? Possibly the transformation is \"tile\" the input by scaling factor 3. But let's check: The input grid is:\n\nRow0: \"990\"\nRow1: \"009\"\nRow2: \"090\"\n\nIf we tile that 3 times to create a 9x9 grid, it might be done by repeating each element three times horizontally and vertically. But let's check: if we tile it, then first row of output would be: \"990\" repeated 3 times would be \"990990990\". But the given output first row is \"000000009\". Not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is something like: the output grid is made of 9 subgrids that are each a transformed version of the input? Look carefully at the structure of output for E.g. 1.\n\nThe output is a 9x9 grid. It might be divided into nine 3x3 blocks arranged in a 3x3 pattern. Let's check: Write the output in blocks of 3 columns each row. We have rows:\n\nRow0: 000 000 009\nRow1: 000 000 990\nRow2: 000 909 000\nRow3: 009 009 000\nRow4: 990 990 000\nRow5: 909 909 000\nRow6: 009 000 009\nRow7: 990 000 990\nRow8: 909 000 909\n\nYes, each row is divided into 3 blocks of 3 columns. Similarly, each column is divided into 3 blocks of 3 rows. So the output grid is a 3x3 arrangement of blocks, each block is 3x3. And each block appears to be a transformation of the corresponding cell from the input grid. Let's check: The input grid is 3x3. So maybe the transformation rule is: For each cell in the input grid, replace it with a 3x3 block with a pattern determined by the cell's digit? But then the output blocks are not all identical for same digit? Let's check: The input grid:\n\nRow0: (0,0)=9, (0,1)=9, (0,2)=0.\nRow1: (1,0)=0, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=9.\nRow2: (2,0)=0, (2,1)=9, (2,2)=0.\n\nNow, check corresponding blocks in output: The top-left block (block (0,0)) is rows 0-2, columns 0-2:\n\nBlock (0,0): \nRow0: \"000\"\nRow1: \"000\"\nRow2: \"000\"\n\nThat block corresponds to input cell (0,0) which is 9. But then top-right block (block (0,2)) is rows 0-2, columns 6-8:\nRow0: \"009\"\nRow1: \"990\"\nRow2: \"909\"\n\nThat block corresponds to input cell (0,2) which is 0. And then middle block (1,1) is rows 3-5, columns 3-5:\nRow3: \"009\"\nRow4: \"990\"\nRow5: \"909\"\nWhich might correspond to input cell (1,1) which is 0. And bottom-right block (block (2,2)) is rows 6-8, columns 6-8:\nRow6: \"009\"\nRow7: \"990\"\nRow8: \"909\"\nWhich corresponds to input cell (2,2) which is 0.\n\nNow, what about the other blocks? Let's label blocks by their coordinates in the output grid. The output 9x9 grid can be seen as arranged in a 3x3 block matrix, where each block is 3x3. Let's denote block (i, j) corresponds to the output block in row block i and column block j.\n\nThen maybe the transformation rule is: For each block (i, j) in the output, fill it with a pattern that depends on the digit in the corresponding input cell plus some offset? Because the output blocks that come from input cell 9 are not the same as those from input cell 0? Let's try to see pattern:\n\nMapping input digit to block pattern:\n- For input digit 9, what blocks did we see? Only top-left block (0,0) is from input digit 9, and it is a 3x3 block of zeros. Also, some blocks from input digit 0. But then the bottom row, block (2,2) is 0, but it is identical to some others.\n- For input digit 9, the corresponding block in E.g. 1: only block (0,0) is 9? Wait, input (0,0)=9, but block (0,0) is all zeros. That doesn't match.\nMaybe the correspondence is reversed: maybe each block in the output is determined not by the input cell but by the corresponding cell's position relative to the grid? Let's re-read the outputs for examples.\n\nMaybe the rule is: \"Superimpose three copies of the input grid, each one rotated or reflected in some way, onto a larger grid.\"\n\nObserving E.g. 1: The output grid is 9x9. And if we look at the pattern, it appears that the left and middle columns of each block are mostly zeros, except in some blocks. There are repeated patterns \"009\", \"990\", \"909\". They appear in columns 6-8 of some rows, etc.\n\nLet's try to segment the output grid into nine 3x3 blocks: Let block indices be (r, c) with r=0,1,2 and c=0,1,2. So block (0,0) occupies rows 0-2, columns 0-2, block (0,1) occupies rows 0-2, columns 3-5, block (0,2) occupies rows 0-2, columns 6-8, and so on.\n\nNow, list the blocks with their content:\n\nBlock (0,0) rows:\nR0: \"000\"\nR1: \"000\"\nR2: \"000\"\n\nBlock (0,1) rows:\nR0: \"000\"\nR1: \"000\"\nR2: \"909\"\n\nBlock (0,2) rows:\nR0: \"009\"\nR1: \"990\"\nR2: \"909\"\n\nBlock (1,0) rows:\nR3: \"009\"\nR4: \"990\"\nR5: \"909\"\n\nBlock (1,1) rows:\nR3: \"009\"\nR4: \"990\"\nR5: \"909\"\n\nBlock (1,2) rows:\nR3: \"000\"\nR4: \"000\"\nR5: \"000\"\n\nBlock (2,0) rows:\nR6: \"009\"\nR7: \"990\"\nR8: \"909\"\n\nBlock (2,1) rows:\nR6: \"000\"\nR7: \"000\"\nR8: \"000\"\n\nBlock (2,2) rows:\nR6: \"009\"\nR7: \"990\"\nR8: \"909\"\n\nNow, what digits appear in the input grid? They are 9, 0, 9, 0, 0, 9, 0, 9, 0. So interestingly, the input grid has two 9's and seven 0's? Actually let's count: row0: 9,9,0; row1: 0,0,9; row2: 0,9,0.

We are given three examples and a test input. The examples are \"ARC\" style puzzles. Let's analyze the given examples.\n\nI see each example: Example 1: \nInput:\n```\n800000000000\n220000000000\n008000000000\n002200000000\n000080000000\n000022000000\n000000800000\n000000220000\n000000008000\n000000002200\n000000000080\n000000000022\n```\nOutput:\n```\n000000000080\n000000000022\n000000008000\n000000002200\n000000800000\n000000220000\n000080000000\n000022000000\n008000000000\n002200000000\n800000000000\n220000000000\n```\nObserving: It appears that the transformation is \"flip vertically\" or might be \"rotate\" or \"transpose\"? Let's check: The input lines 1 and 12 swapped? Actually, re-read carefully:\n\nExample 1: There are 12 rows, each row is 12 columns (like a square grid). The output grid is exactly the input grid reversed vertically. The first line of the output is the last line of the input (\"000000000022\") and the last line of output is the first line of the input (\"800000000000\"). But let's check: The input first line: \"800000000000\". The output first line is \"000000000022\" which is the last line. So it's a vertical flip. But then check second line: Input second line: \"220000000000\". Output second line is \"000000000022\" - wait let me check: Actually, let me check carefully:\n\nExample 1, input rows:\nRow1: \"800000000000\"\nRow2: \"220000000000\"\nRow3: \"008000000000\"\nRow4: \"002200000000\"\nRow5: \"000080000000\"\nRow6: \"000022000000\"\nRow7: \"000000800000\"\nRow8: \"000000220000\"\nRow9: \"000000008000\"\nRow10:\"000000002200\"\nRow11:\"000000000080\"\nRow12:\"000000000022\"\n\nOutput rows:\nRow1: \"000000000080\" \nRow2: \"000000000022\"\nRow3: \"000000008000\"\nRow4: \"000000002200\"\nRow5: \"000000800000\"\nRow6: \"000000220000\"\nRow7: \"000080000000\"\nRow8: \"000022000000\"\nRow9: \"008000000000\"\nRow10:\"002200000000\"\nRow11:\"800000000000\"\nRow12:\"220000000000\"\n\nSo indeed, output row i is input row 13 - i. So it's vertical flip (flip top-to-bottom).\n\nCheck Example 2:\nInput (12 rows, each row length 12):\nRow1: \"000000000022\"\nRow2: \"000000000032\"\nRow3: \"000000002200\"\nRow4: \"000000003200\"\nRow5: \"000000220000\"\nRow6: \"000000320000\"\nRow7: \"000022000000\"\nRow8: \"000032000000\"\nRow9: \"002200000000\"\nRow10:\"003200000000\"\nRow11:\"220000000000\"\nRow12:\"320000000000\"\n\nOutput:\nRow1: \"220000000000\"\nRow2: \"320000000000\"\nRow3: \"002200000000\"\nRow4: \"003200000000\"\nRow5: \"000022000000\"\nRow6: \"000032000000\"\nRow7: \"000000220000\"\nRow8: \"000000320000\"\nRow9: \"000000002200\"\nRow10:\"000000003200\"\nRow11:\"000000000022\"\nRow12:\"000000000032\"\n\nAgain, the output is input reversed vertically. Check: Input row1 becomes output row12? Actually wait: Let's check: Output row1 is \"220000000000\", which is the last row of input row 12. So transformation is vertical flip.\n\nCheck Example 3:\nInput (10 rows, each row length 10):\nRow1: \"2100000000\"\nRow2: \"1000000000\"\nRow3: \"0021000000\"\nRow4: \"0010000000\"\nRow5: \"0000210000\"\nRow6: \"0000100000\"\nRow7: \"0000002100\"\nRow8: \"0000001000\"\nRow9: \"0000000021\"\nRow10:\"0000000010\"\n\nOutput:\nRow1: \"0000000021\"\nRow2: \"0000000010\"\nRow3: \"0000002100\"\nRow4: \"0000001000\"\nRow5: \"0000210000\"\nRow6: \"0000100000\"\nRow7: \"0021000000\"\nRow8: \"0010000000\"\nRow9: \"2100000000\"\nRow10:\"1000000000\"\n\nYes, output is input reversed vertically. So rule: The transformation is simply vertically flipping the grid (i.e. reversing the order of rows).\n\nNow check test input:\nTest input, lines:\nLine1: \"00000000000018\"\nLine2: \"00000000000081\"\nLine3: \"00000000001800\"\nLine4: \"00000000008100\"\nLine5: \"00000000180000\"\nLine6: \"00000000810000\"\nLine7: \"00000018000000\"\nLine8: \"00000081000000\"\nLine9: \"00001800000000\"\nLine10:\"00008100000000\"\nLine11:\"00180000000000\"\nLine12:\"00810000000000\"\nLine13:\"18000000000000\"\nLine14:\"81000000000000\"\n\nSo transformation is vertical flip, so output is input reversed order.\n\nSo output grid is:\nRow1 becomes line14: \"81000000000000\"\nRow2 becomes line13: \"18000000000000\"\nRow3 becomes line12: \"00810000000000\"\nRow4 becomes line11: \"00180000000000\"\nRow5 becomes line10: \"00008100000000\"\nRow6 becomes line9: \"00001800000000\"\nRow7 becomes line8: \"00000081000000\"\nRow8 becomes line7: \"00000018000000\"\nRow9 becomes line6: \"00000000810000\"\nRow10:\"00000000180000\"\nRow11:\"00000000008100\"\nRow12:\"00000000001800\"\nRow13:\"00000000000081\"\nRow14:\"00000000000018\"\n\nLet's check consistency: The test input appears to be 14 rows, each row is 14 columns. The transformation is vertical flip. So the answer is the list of rows reversed.\n\nThus output final JSON list of lists with each list representing a row of digits as a string? But instructions: \"Output concise reasoning in <thinking> of 5 or less steps\". So our answer must be enclosed in \"<answer>\" with final test grid, and a \"<thinking>\" with concise reasoning. So output final answer as \"<answer>\" containing the grid as JSON list of lists, each row being a string. But instructions ask for \"concise reasoning in <thinking>\" of 5 or less steps. So output must be less than 5 steps. We need to produce final answer in <answer> tag with our final grid in JSON list of lists.\n\nI need to produce final answer in JSON list of lists e.g. [[1,0]] but our grid rows are strings. They want the output grid in a \"JSON list of lists\" but each row is a string? They provided sample: \"[[1,0]]\" but our grid rows are full strings. But it's ambiguous because the examples are provided as plain text lines. However, our output must be in JSON list of lists? But our grid elements are strings, so we need to output as: [[\"81000000000000\", \"18000000000000\", ...]\n\nWait: They said \"JSON list of lists, e.g., [[1,0]]\" but then the examples are string grids. But I assume the grid is a list of lists where each element is a string representation of the row. But the given sample output is just lines separated. But instructions \"Output the final test grid (JSON list of lists, e.g., [[1,0]])\" So each row becomes a list of characters? But maybe each row is a string. But then \"[[1,0]]\" is ambiguous. Possibly they want a list of lists of characters? But the examples are not \"list of lists of characters\", they are lists of strings? I check sample: \"E.g. 1 Output: 000000000080, etc.\" But not exactly. The instructions \"JSON list of lists\" might mean that each row is represented as list of characters? But then \"e.g., [[1,0]]\" is ambiguous.\n\nWait, check instructions \"Output the final test grid (JSON list of lists, e.g., [[1,0]])\". That example has no quotes. It might be that each grid cell is a number. But our grid is composed of digits. They might be expected to be as list of strings. But in any event, the output should be a list of rows. Possibly we can output a list of lists where each row is a list of characters, if we want to be consistent with the sample \"[[1,0]]\". But in the sample, the inner", "prompt_tokens": 845, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Some pattern: \"8\" becomes \"2\"? Actually, let's check row by row.\n\nLet's denote each row with indices: rows and columns.\n\nI'll try to re-read E.g. 1 input and output with coordinates. There are 8 rows, 12 columns. But each row string: \"000008000000\" -> probably the digits are arranged in columns. Let me enumerate columns indices 0 to 11.\n\nE.g. 1, row 0 input: \"000008000000\" = positions: col0: 0, col1: 0, col2: 0, col3: 0, col4: 0, col5: 8, col6: 0, col7: 0, col8: 0, col9: 0, col10: 0, col11: 0.\nOutput row 0: \"000028220000\" = digits: 0,0,0,0,2,8,2,2,0,0,0,0.\nSo transformation: the input row had a single 8 at column 5, but output row has \"2\" at col4, \"8\" at col5, and \"2\" at col6? Wait check: output row: col4 digit: 2, col5: 8, col6: 2, col7: 2, col8: 0. But why do we see two 2's? Actually, let me re-read: \"000028220000\" -> digit by digit: \nIndex: 0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0, 4:2, 5:8, 6:2, 7:2, 8:0, 9:0, 10:0, 11:0.\nSo in output row, there is an \"8\" in same position col5? But then extra digits \"2\" appear to left and right of the 8? \nMaybe rule: find the leftmost nonzero? Possibly rule: \"highlight\" the boundaries of contiguous blocks of 8's? But then row 0 had only one 8, but output has two 2's on either side of that 8. Let's check row 1 input: \"000088000000\" = digits: positions? Let's recalc:\nRow 1 input: \"000088000000\": digits: col0:0, col1:0, col2:0, col3:0, col4:8, col5:8, col6:0, col7:0, col8:0, col9:0, col10:0, col11:0.\nOutput row 1: \"000088220000\": digits: col0:0, col1:0, col2:0, col3:0, col4:8, col5:8, col6:2, col7:2, col8:0, col9:0, col10:0, col11:0.\nSo row 1: contiguous block \"88\" in input columns 4 and 5 remain same in output at columns 4 and 5, but then additional 2's appear at columns 6 and 7? So pattern: In row 0, there was block of one 8 at col5, and output got 2's inserted around it. In row 1, block of two 8's at cols 4-5, output becomes \"88\" then \"22\"? \nRow 2 input: \"000088880000\": digits: likely block \"888\" from col4 to col6. Output row 2: \"000088880000\" remains same, no extra digits added.\nRow 3 input: same as row 2, output same.\nRow 4 input: \"000000008880\": digits: block \"888\" at col7-col9 maybe? Let's check: \"000000008880\" = positions: col0,1,2,3,4,5 are 0, col6 is 0, col7:8, col8:8, col9:8, col10, col11: 0? Wait recalc: string \"000000008880\": It has 12 characters. Let's index:\n0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:8,8:8,9:8,10:0,11:0.\nOutput row 4: \"000000008882\": digits: col0-5:0, col6:0, col7:8, col8:8, col9:8, col10:2, col11:2.\nSo block remains same for first three 8's, but then extra 2's appended at end? Row 5 input: \"000000008880\" same as row4? Output row 5: \"000000008882\", same pattern.\nRow 6 input: \"000000008808\": digits: possibly block \"888\" at col7-? Let's recalc \"000000008808\": positions: 0-5:0,6:0,7:8,8:8,9:0,10:8,11:0? Wait, let's count: \"000000008808\" has 12 characters, index: 0:0, 1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:8,8:8,9:0,10:8,11:0.\nOutput row 6: \"000000008828\": digits: col0-5:0, col6:0, col7:8, col8:8, col9:2, col10:8, col11:2.\nRow 7 input: \"000000008800\": digits: block \"888\" at col7-9? Let's check: \"000000008800\": positions: 0:0,1:0,...,6:0,7:8,8:8,9:0,10:0,11:0.\nOutput row 7: \"000000008822\": digits: col0-6:0, col7:8, col8:8, col9:2, col10:2, col11:2? Actually output row 7: \"000000008822\" digits: index: 0-6:0, col7:8, col8:8, col9:2, col10:2, col11:2. So pattern: row 7: input block \"888\" becomes \"88\" then appended \"222\".\n\nObserving pattern: It seems like transformation rule is \"insert a pair of 2's adjacent to each occurrence of a contiguous block of 8's that has odd length, or maybe always add 2's after block of 8's if block length is less than 3? But row 2 and row 3 input blocks are \"888\" and output remains same. So rule: change blocks of 8's that are of length 1 or 2 by inserting 2's? But row 0: block length 1 got extra 2's inserted before the block? Actually row 0: block \"8\" at col5 becomes \"2\", then \"8\", then \"2\", then \"2\" resulting in \"2 8 2 2\"? Wait, let's re-read row 0: output: \"000028220000\". It doesn't look like a contiguous block of 8's; it's \"2\", \"8\", \"2\", \"2\". But then row", "prompt_tokens": 677, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We have to deduce transformation rule. Let's analyze given examples.\n\nWe have three examples:\n\nExample 1: \nInput grid (lines):\nRow1: \"000000000\"\nRow2: \"000000000\"\nRow3: \"000000000\"\nRow4: \"003250000\"\nRow5: \"003300000\"\nRow6: \"014000000\"\nRow7: \"000000000\"\nE.g. 1 Output:\nRow1: \"000000000\"\nRow2: \"000000410\"\nRow3: \"000003300\"\nRow4: \"000052300\"\nRow5: \"000000000\"\nRow6: \"000000000\"\nRow7: \"000000000\"\n\nWait, check coordinates: Actually, as given in problem text, \"E.g. 1 Input:\" has 7 rows. But the output is 7 rows with the same numbers? Let's re-read carefully:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n003250000\n003300000\n014000000\n000000000\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\n000000000\n000000410\n000003300\n000052300\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n\nWait, the transformation appears to be that the input grid is rearranged in some way. Possibly the transformation is \"rotate the grid by 90 degrees\", but not exactly.\n\nLet's check coordinates: The input grid is 7 rows x 9 columns? Actually, the given string \"000000000\" is 9 digits. But then \"003250000\" etc are 9 digits. So each row is 9 digits. But output grid also has 7 rows of 9 digits. But each output row is different from input row? Let's check:\n\nIn E.g. 1, input rows:\nRow0: 000000000\nRow1: 000000000\nRow2: 000000000\nRow3: 003250000\nRow4: 003300000\nRow5: 014000000\nRow6: 000000000\n\nOutput:\nRow0: 000000000\nRow1: 000000410\nRow2: 000003300\nRow3: 000052300\nRow4: 000000000\nRow5: 000000000\nRow6: 000000000\n\nI wonder if the transformation is like \"shift the non-zero digits upward\"? Possibly the transformation is \"take the digits from the lower rows and move them upward, reversing order vertically\"? But let's check: In input, there are non-zero digits in rows 3,4,5. In output, non-zero digits appear in row1, row2, row3. They are moved one row up? But then row0 remains 000000000. But row3 of input had \"003250000\", row4 \"003300000\", row5 \"014000000\", then output row1: \"000000410\", row2: \"000003300\", row3: \"000052300\". They appear reversed order vertically? Let's check positions:\n\nMapping:\nOriginal row3: \"003250000\" becomes output row? In output, row? Let's check: output row3 is \"000052300\". Compare digits: original row3 digits: 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. Output row3 digits: 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So it appears that the digits are reversed horizontally? Wait, check: original row3: \"003250000\", if we reverse it, we get \"000253000\". But output row3 is \"000052300\". Not exactly reversed.\n\nMaybe the transformation is \"rotate by 90 degrees clockwise\"? Let's try that: For a 7x9 grid, a 90-degree rotation would yield a 9x7 grid, not same dimension. So maybe it's a reflection? Alternatively, maybe the transformation is \"flip vertically\"? But if we flip vertically, then row3 becomes row3, row4 becomes row2, row5 becomes row1. Check: if we flip vertically, then new row1 would be old row5: \"014000000\", but output row1 is \"000000410\". That is the reverse of \"014000000\". Similarly, new row2 would be old row4: \"003300000\" reversed becomes \"000033000\", but output row2 is \"000003300\". And new row3 would be old row3: \"003250000\" reversed becomes \"000253000\", but output row3 is \"000052300\". So it's not just vertical reflection.\n\nMaybe it's \"flip horizontally\"? If we flip horizontally, then row3 becomes same row, but digits reversed? Let's try: For row3: \"003250000\" reversed horizontally is \"000253000\". But output row3 is \"000052300\", which is not identical.\n\nMaybe it's \"rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise and then reflect\"? Let's try: The transformation might be: The grid is being \"rotated\" along the anti-diagonal maybe? Let's try mapping coordinates: Consider indices (row, col). E.g. 1 output has \"410\" in row1, columns 6,7,8? Let's check: row1, col6=4, col7=1, col8=0. Where do these digits come from in input? Possibly from row5 maybe? Let's try to re-map coordinate indices. Let grid indices: rows 0 to 6, columns 0 to 8. Look at input row5: \"014000000\". The digits \"014\" at beginning. In output, row1 \"000000410\" the last three digits \"410\" appear. That suggests that row5, columns 0-2 become row1, columns 6-8 but reversed order? Because row5: \"0 1 4\", reversed is \"4 1 0\". So that fits: row5 reversed becomes row1 last three columns.\n\nNow check row4: \"003300000\". The first three digits: \"0 0 3\"? But output row2 \"000003300\" has \"330\" at the end? Let's check: row4 reversed is \"000033000\"? Actually, let's check: row4 \"003300000\" reversed is \"000033000\". But output row2 \"000003300\": the last three digits are \"330\", but the preceding digits \"00000\" and then \"0033\"? Let's analyze carefully:\n\nLet's index rows with 0-index:\nInput:\nRow0: columns: all 0.\nRow1: all 0.\nRow2: all 0.\nRow3: \"003250000\" so digits: col0=0, col1=0, col2=3, col3=2, col4=5, col5=0, col6=0, col7=0, col8=0.\nRow4: \"003300000\": digits: col0=0, col1=0, col2=3, col3=3, col4=0, col5=0, col6=0, col7=0, col8=0.\nRow5: \"014000000\": digits: col0=0, col1=1, col2=4, col3=0, col4=0, col5=0, col6=0, col7=0, col8=0.\nRow6: all 0.\n\nOutput:\nRow0: \"000000000\"\nRow1: \"000000410\": digits: col0=0,..., col5=0, col6=4, col7=1, col8=0.\nRow2: \"000003300\": digits: col0=0,..., col5=0, col6=0, col7=3, col8=0, but wait, \"000003300\" has length 9, so digits: col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=0, col4=0, col5=0, col6=3, col7=3, col8=0.\nRow3: \"000052300\": digits: col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=0, col4=5, col5=2, col6=3, col7=0, col8=0.\nRow4: \"000000000\"\nRow5: \"000000000\"\nRow6: \"000000000\"\n\nLet's try to correlate: Look at row5 input \"014000000\" reversed is \"000000410\". Output row1 is \"000000410\". So that suggests: output row1 = reverse(input row5). Then row4 input \"003300000\" reversed is \"000033000\", but output row2 is \"000003300\". Not quite the same reversal. Wait, check row4: \"003300000\" reversed would be \"000033000\", but output row2 is \"000003300\". They differ in the order of the two 3's? Let's compare: \"000033000\" vs \"000003300\". They are not identical if we compare digit by digit: In \"000033000\", the 3's are at positions 6 and 7, while in \"000003300\", the 3's are at positions 7 and 8? Let's check: \"000033000\": index0=0,1=0,2=0,3=0,4=0,5=0,6", "prompt_tokens": 597, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Compare row1 input and row16 input: They are identical. row2 input equals row15 input? Check row2: \"6866646116466686\" and row15: \"6866646133466686\" differ? Actually, row15 input: \"6866646133466686\", row2 input: \"6866646116466686\". They are not identical. But output row1 equals output row16, row2 equals row15. Possibly output grid is symmetric vertically (maybe mirror horizontally, i.e. reversing rows)? But then row 3 input vs row 14 output maybe swapped? Let's check: For example, output row3 (which is \"8688466666648868\") and output row14 (which is \"6446116776116446\"). They are not the same. So not horizontal mirror.\n\nMaybe the rule is \"rotate by 180 degrees\"? Check E.g. 1: row1 input equals row16 input? They do: row1 input: \"6688164664618866\", row16 input: \"6688164664618866\". So grid is symmetric with horizontal flip? Let's check row2 vs row15: row2 input: \"6866646116466686\", row15 input: \"6866646133466686\" differ in some digit: 1 vs 3? So not exactly symmetric.\n\nMaybe rule is \"flip horizontally\"? Let's check: For example, E.g. 1 input row3: \"8688333666648868\" vs output row3: \"8688466666648868\". Compare digit by digit:\nInput row3: 8 6 8 8 3 3 3 6 6 6 4 8 8 6 8? Let's write positions indexes:\nRow3:\nIndex: 1:8, 2:6, 3:8, 4:8, 5:3, 6:3, 7:3, 8:6, 9:6, 10:6, 11:4, 12:8, 13:8, 14:6, 15:8, 16:?\nWait, let me re-read properly: \"8688333666648868\" is 16 digits: positions:\n1:8, 2:6, 3:8, 4:8, 5:3, 6:3, 7:3, 8:3, 9:3, 10:6, 11:6, 12:6, 13:4, 14:8, 15:8, 16:6, 17:8? Wait, I need to count carefully. Actually, I'll count: \"8688333666648868\". Count digits: \"8\" (1), \"6\"(2), \"8\"(3), \"8\"(4), \"3\"(5), \"3\"(6), \"3\"(7), \"3\"(8), \"3\"(9), \"6\"(10), \"6\"(11), \"6\"(12), \"4\"(13), \"8\"(14), \"8\"(15), \"6\"(16), \"8\"(17)? That gives 17 digits. But grid is 16x16, so each row should be 16 digits. Let's count carefully from the problem statement: They are provided as one continuous string per line. The first example: \"6688164664618866\" count digits: 16 digits? Let's count: \"6688164664618866\": digits: 6,6,8,8,1,6,4,6,6,4,6,1,8,8,6,6. Yes 16 digits.\nNow \"8688333666648868\": count: 8,6,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,4,8,8,6,8? That looks like 17 digits. Let me re-read the given text carefully. The given text: \n\nE.g. 1 Input: \n6688164664618866\n6866646116466686\n8688333666648868\n8689333666169868\n1646333772726461\n6461333777571646\n4666275775726664\n6166777557776616\n6166777557776616\n4666275775726664\n6461757777571646\n1646272772726461\n8689616666169868\n8688466633648868\n6866646133466686\n6688164664618866\n\nI must recount \"8688333666648868\". It should be 16 digits. Let me count: \n\"8\" (1), \"6\" (2), \"8\" (3), \"8\" (4), \"3\" (5), \"3\" (6), \"3\" (7), \"3\" (8), \"3\" (9), \"6\" (10), \"6\" (11), \"6\" (12), \"4\" (13), \"8\" (14), \"8\" (15), \"6\" (16), then maybe \"8\" is extra? Possibly it's \"8688333666648868\" correctly has 16 digits if I consider: 8,6,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,6,6,6,4,8,8,6, maybe \"8\" is not there. Let me count manually by grouping: \"86 88 33 33 66 48 68\"? That doesn't work.\n\nWait, I'll check length by grouping: The expected grid is 16 columns. The first row \"6688164664618866\" is clearly 16 digits. So each row must be 16 digits. In \"8688333666648868\", count: \nIndex: \n1:8\n2:6\n3:8\n4:8\n5:3\n6:3\n7:3\n8:3\n9:3\n10:6\n11:6\n12:6\n13:4\n14:8\n15:8\n16:6\nBut then there is an extra \"8\" at the end? Because \"8688333666648868\" length is 16 if I consider:\nMaybe I'll count characters: I'll write indices: \n0: 8\n1: 6\n2: 8\n3: 8\n4: 3\n5: 3\n6: 3\n7: 3\n8: 3\n9:", "prompt_tokens": 1443, "completion_tokens": 2048}

{"task_id": "9110e3c5", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus:free", "raw_response": "We are given several examples of input and output pairs with transformation rules. We are told that we need to deduce the transformation rule from the examples. The grid examples are provided with rows? Actually, the examples: There are examples for e.g. 1, e.g. 2,... They are examples for transformation that result in a 3x3 output grid. Each example input is composed of 7 rows. Wait, let's re-read the provided examples.\n\nThey say: \"E.g. 1 Input:\" then the lines:\n0410016\n0010000\n1100110\n0100011\n0010020\n1010107\n1110410\nThen \"E.g. 1 Output:\" then:\n008\n880\n080\n\nI see that the output grid is a 3x3 grid. The input grid is 7 rows. Similarly, E.g. 2 Input: (7 rows) and output is 3 rows. So pattern: The transformation is applied from an input grid of size 7x? Possibly the input grid is 7 rows of digits. Let's check number of columns. For e.g. 1: first row \"0410016\" is 7 characters, so grid is 7 rows x 7 columns. But output is 3 rows x 3 columns. So perhaps the transformation is: Given a 7x7 grid, produce a 3x3 grid output. But then check E.g. 2: Input \"2002205\" etc, each row has 7 digits, output: \"000\", \"888\", \"000\" which is 3 rows each of 3 digits. So yes, pattern: 7x7 input -> 3x3 output grid.\n\nLet's check E.g. 3: Input grid \"0400413\", ... output: \"088\", \"080\", \"080\". Same size: 7 rows input, 3 rows output.\n\nFor all examples, input is 7 rows of length 7 digits. Output is always 3 rows of length 3 digits. So transformation rule takes a 7x7 grid and outputs a 3x3 grid. What kind of transformation does it do? Let's try to determine by analyzing the given examples.\n\nObservations: There is pattern in outputs: They are drawn from digits: sometimes output digits are 0, 8, maybe 9? Wait: Let's check e.g. 1: output: \nRow1: 008, row2: 880, row3: 080.\nE.g. 2: output: \n000, 888, 000.\nE.g. 3: output: \n088, 080, 080.\nE.g. 4: output: \n008, 880, 080.\nE.g. 5: output: \n088, 080, 080.\nE.g. 6: output: \n000, 888, 000.\nE.g. 7: output: \n000, 888, 000.\n\nSo outputs are similar to pattern \"X, Y, X\" with Y being either 880 or 888. For examples 2,6,7, the center row is \"888\" and the outer rows \"000\". For examples 1,4 output: middle row \"880\", outer rows \"008\" and \"080\"? Actually, e.g. 1: top row: 008, middle row: 880, bottom row: 080.\nE.g. 4: same as e.g. 1.\nFor e.g. 3 and 5, top row: 088, middle row: 080, bottom row: 080.\n\nWait, but then e.g. 2,6,7: top is \"000\", middle \"888\", bottom \"000\". So there's a variation. Possibly the transformation rule involves summing some submatrices of the input grid? Possibly the rule extracts the center 3x3 from the input grid? But let's check: In a 7x7 grid, the center 3x3 subgrid is rows 3,4,5 and columns 3,4,5. But then check e.g. 1: the center 3x3 extracted from input e.g. 1: rows 3-5, columns 3-5. Let's index rows and columns from 1 to 7.\n\nFor e.g. 1: input:\nRow1: 0 4 1 0 0 1 6\nRow2: 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nRow3: 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\nRow4: 0 1 0 0 0 1 1\nRow5: 0 0 1 0 0 2 0\nRow6: 1 0 1 0 1 0 7? Wait, check: \"1010107\" row6, so digits: 1,0,1,0,1,0,7\nRow7: 1,1,1,0,4,1,0\n\nNow, if we take the center 3x3 from rows 3-5 and columns 3-5, we get:\nRow3, columns 3-5: digits: (1,0,1)? Actually row3: \"1100110\": columns: 3:0, 4:0, 5:1 -> \"001\".\nRow4, columns 3-5: row4: \"0100011\": columns 3-5: digits: \"0,0,1\" -> \"001\".\nRow5, columns 3-5: row5: \"0010020\": columns 3-5: \"1,0,2\" -> \"102\".\nBut output e.g. 1 is \"008\", \"880\", \"080\". Not matching.\n\nMaybe it's summing some parts? Possibly each output cell is computed based on sum or difference of border digits? Let's check differences between e.g. 1 and e.g. 2. E.g. 1 input: first row \"0410016\". e.g. 1 output first row: \"008\". E.g. 2 input: first row \"2002205\", output: \"000\". So maybe the rule is \"if sum of outer ring is even, then output digit becomes 8 or 0\"? But then e.g. 1 top row: computed \"008\": first digit 0, then 0, then 8. e.g. 2 top row: 0,0,0. So maybe the output digits are computed by summing pairs of corresponding digits in symmetric positions in the input grid? Possibly the transformation: For each cell in the output, compute something like: output[r][c] = input[r*2+?]. \n\nMaybe it's like: the output grid is a \"thinned\" version of the input grid, where the output cell value is computed by summing certain positions from the input grid. Possibly the transformation is like: output[i][j] = sum of input[2*i + something][2*j + something] mod something? Because input size is 7, output size is 3, that's a factor of roughly 2.33 though, not exactly.\n\nConsider the possibility that it's a \"pattern\" transformation: maybe the rule is: \"Take the 7x7 input, and remove the border, leaving a 3x3 grid.\" But checking e.g. 1: if we remove the outer border (i.e. remove first and last row, and first and last column), then we get a 5x5 subgrid. But then how do we get 3x3? If we remove one row and one column from the 5x5, you might get 3x3 if you remove the top and bottom row of the inner 5x5 and leftmost and rightmost column. Let's try: For e.g. 1, inner 5x5 is rows 2-6, columns 2-6. That subgrid is:\nRow2: columns 2-6: \"0 1 0 0 0\" (from \"0010000\")\nRow3: columns 2-6: \"1 0 0 1 1\" (from \"1100110\")\nRow4: columns 2-6: \"1 0 0 0 1\" (from \"0100011\")\nRow5: columns 2-6: \"0 1 0 0 2\" (from \"0010020\")\nRow6: columns 2-6: \"0 1 0 1 0\" (from \"1010107\")\nThat is 5x5. If we then take the center 3x3 of that 5x5 (i.e. rows 2-4, columns 2-4) we get:\nRow2 of inner 5x5: \"1 0 0\" -> \"100\"\nRow3: \"0 0 0\" -> \"000\"\nRow4: \"0 1 0\" -> \"010\"\nThat doesn't match \"008\", \"880\", \"080\".\n\nMaybe the rule is: output grid = XOR or OR of some specific positions? Look at outputs digits: They are either 0 or 8 mostly. In e.g. 1, output: 008, 880, 080. In e.g. 2, output: 000, 888, 000. In e.g. 3, output: 088, 080, 080. In e.g. 4, same as e.g.", "prompt_tokens": 743, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The transformation seems to be: \"Zero out some cells, shift some numbers.\" Let's check positions:\n\nFor e.g. 1:\nInput grid has a pattern: digits in left and right? Let's mark coordinates using row, col indices counting from 0.\n\nLet's denote coordinates as (r, c). Let's analyze \"corner\" positions.\n\nObserving example 1: There is a repeated pattern: '3's appear in the top corners? Actually, let's check: In input, row 1: \"000030000000\". There is a '3' in column index 4? Actually, check: \"000030000000\": The digit '3' appears at index 4 (0-indexed: 3 is at index 4, then 0's until index11). In output row 1: \"000000030000\". There is a '3' at column index 6? Wait, let's check: \"000000030000\" means digit '3' is at index 6 (0-indexed) or index 7? Let's count: digits: indices: 0: 0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:3, 7:0, 8:0, 9:0, 10:0, 11:0. So the '3' moved from col=4 to col=6? That is a shift of +2 columns? But check the second row: same transformation? row2: input \"000030000000\" becomes \"000000030000\". Yes, same.\n\nThen look at row3: input row3: \"002222220000\". There is a digit '2' repeated from index2 to index8? Actually, \"002222220000\": index0:0, index1:0, index2:2, index3:2, index4:2, index5:2, index6:2, index7:2, index8:2, index9:0, index10:0, index11:0. In output row3: \"332222223333\" i.e. row3 becomes: \"332222223333\", which is 12 digits, first two digits are 3 and last two digits are 3. So what happened? The input row3 \"002222220000\" turned into \"332222223333\". So the left part \"00\" became \"33\", and the right part \"0000\" became \"3333\" but the middle \"222222\" remained same? Let's check: output \"332222223333\": it's \"33\"+\"222222\"+\"3333\"? Wait, length: \"33\" is two digits, then \"222222\" is six digits, then \"3333\" is four digits, total 12. But input row3 \"002222220000\" is \"00\"+\"222222\"+\"0000\", so the transformation here seems to be: pad with 3's on the left and right boundaries. But then check row6: input row6 \"332333323333\" becomes output row6 \"002000020000\". That is a dramatic change. Let's check row6: input row6 \"332333323333\". What digits: it is symmetric? Count digits: Actually, row6 input: \"332333323333\". Count: digits: 0:3, 1:3, 2:2, 3:3, 4:3, 5:3, 6:2, 7:3, 8:2, 9:3, 10:3, 11:3. And output row6: \"002000020000\", which is \"00\"+\"2000\"+\"002000\" with extra zeros? Actually, let's check: \"002000020000\" digits: 0:0,1:0,2:2,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:2,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0. So row6 changed dramatically: the pattern \"332333323333\" became \"002000020000\"? That doesn't look like a simple padding. Let's re-check examples carefully.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is something like \"flip\" the grid vertically and horizontally? But then row3 in example 1: input row3 \"002222220000\" becomes output row3 \"332222223333\". That is not a flip. Let's check: Perhaps the transformation rule is \"remove a border\" or \"shift\" the center region? There is pattern: In output grids, many rows become with repeated patterns of zeros except with a central block of digits. Let's check positions.\n\nFor e.g. 1:\nOutput grid row3: \"332222223333\" - this row has a block of 222222 in the middle, but then 3's on both sides.\nOutput grid row4: \"002000020000\" - row4 in output becomes: \"002000020000\" which is almost all zeros except a 2 in the middle?\nWait, check row4: \"002000020000\": positions: index2 is '2', index7 is '2'? Actually \"002000020000\": Let's index: 0:0,1:0,2:2,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:2,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0. So row4 got two 2's separated by zeros.\nRow5: same as row4.\nRow6: \"002000020000\"\nRow7: \"002000020000\"\nRow8: \"002222220000\" which is similar to input row3? Wait, row8: output row8 \"002222220000\" matches input row3 \"002222220000\"? Actually, no: input row3 was \"002222220000\", output row8 is \"002222220000\". Yes same.\nRow1 and row2: output rows are \"000000030000\", which is similar to row1 input \"000030000000\" but with the 3 shifted by 2 positions to the right.\nRow9-12: output rows \"000000030000\" same as row1 output.\n\nWhat transformation rule might be? Let's compare input and output for each row index maybe relative to center.\n\nObserving grids, they are 12 rows. Possibly the transformation rule is to mirror horizontally the left and right parts of the grid? Wait, check row3: input row3 \"002222220000\" becomes output row3 \"332222223333\". That is like the left two digits become 3's and the right four digits become 3's, but the middle six digits remain unchanged. Meanwhile, row4: input row4 \"002030020000\" becomes output row4 \"002000020000\". So the \"30\" in the middle becomes \"00\"? And row6: input row6 \"332333323333\" becomes output row6 \"002000020000\". So maybe the transformation is: replace all occurrences of '3' with a combination of zeros except in the corners? That doesn't feel consistent.\n\nLet's align coordinates more systematically. I'll denote rows as r=0 to 11 and columns c=0 to 11.\n\nFor E.g.1, I'll list input and output rows with coordinates.\n\nLet grid be 12 rows. I'll index rows 0 to 11.\n\nInput E.g.1:\nRow0: \"000030000000\"\nRow1: \"000030000000\"\nRow2: \"002222220000\"\nRow3: \"002030020000\"\nRow4: \"002030020000\"\nRow5: \"332333323333\"\nRow6: \"002030020000\"\nRow7: \"002222220000\"\nRow8: \"000030000000\"\nRow9: \"000030000000\"\nRow10:\"000030000000\"\nRow11:\"000030000000\"\n\nOutput E.g.1:\nRow0: \"000000030000\"\nRow1: \"000000030000\"\nRow2: \"332222223333\"\nRow3: \"002000020000\"\nRow4: \"002000020000", "prompt_tokens": 841, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's align: \"671176224\" vs \"671176964\".

But look at row 12: \"189977469671176224779981\" vs \"189977469671176964779981\". The substring \"671176224\" vs \"671176964\". The difference is that the first half is same: \"189977469671176\" then a block \"224\" becomes \"964\", then \"779981\" remains same. Similarly row 13: \"189977469671176224222981\" in input becomes \"189977469671176964779981\" in output. \nWait, check row 13 input: \"189977469671176224222981\". Actually let's check carefully. The given input row 13 is \"189977469671176224222981\" but the output row 13 is \"189977469671176964779981\". The transformation seems to be that the second half of digits in the row (after the \"671176\") are replaced by their complement relative to something, maybe 9-x or something? \nLet's see: \"224\" vs \"964\": For each digit, maybe difference: 2->9, 2->6, 4->4? Actually 2->? Let's compare: if we subtract 2 from 7? Not sure.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is a rotation or reflection of segments in the grid? Possibly the transformation rule is \"flip horizontally the center columns\" or \"swap two quadrants\".\n\nWait, let's look at example 2. \nE.g. 2: \nInput:\n954146715717717517641459\n544499171675576171994445\n446564516764467615465644\n145144227576675767441541\n496466226766667671664694\n694464224661166457464496\n222227228536635885717517\n222225866338833668576171\n516764865586685568467615\n767576535588885535675767\n176766338855558833667671\n754661686858858686166457\n754661686858858686166457\n176766338855558833667671\n767576535588885535675767\n516764865586685568467615\n171675866338833668576171\n715717588536635885717517\n694464754661166457464496\n496466176766667671664694\n145144767576675767441541\n446564516764467615465644\n544499171675576171994445\n954146715717717517641459\n\nOutput:\n954146715717717517641459\n544499171675576171994445\n446564516764467615465644\n145144767576675767441541\n496466176766667671664694\n694464754661166457464496\n715717588536635885717517\n171675866338833668576171\n516764865586685568467615\n767576535588885535675767\n176766338855558833667671\n754661686858858686166457\n754661686858858686166457\n176766338855558833667671\n767576535588885535675767\n516764865586685568467615\n171675866338833668576171\n715717588536635885717517\n694464754661166457464496\n496466176766667671664694\n145144767576675767441541\n446564516764467615465644\n544499171675576171994445\n954146715717717517641459\n\nObserving differences: Compare input and output row by row:\nRow 1: identical.\nRow 2: identical.\nRow 3: identical.\nRow 4: Input: \"145144227576675767441541\", Output: \"145144767576675767441541\".

Let's re-read the problem statement: \"The user will provide several pairs of example input grids and their corresponding output grids.\" But then the text shows \"E.g. 1 Input:\" and then a block of text. It might be that these are different puzzles examples from ARC. Usually, ARC puzzles are about pattern transformations. \n\nI see that in the outputs, some rows remain unchanged, while some rows are replaced with a different pattern. Let's analyze the differences between Input and Output for E.g. 1.\n\nComparing the first three rows, they are identical in both input and output:\nRow1: \"000100010001000100010001000\" remains same.\nRow2 same, row3 same.\n\nRow4 is \"111111111111111111111111111\" remains same.\n\nThen row5: In input, row5 is \"000133010001000100010001000\". In output, row5 becomes \"000133010001330100013301000\". So what changed? Compare positions: \"000133010001000100010001000\" vs \"000133010001330100013301000\". It appears that the transformation happens on groups of three digits maybe? Let's analyze row5: The initial row seems to be split into segments: \"000133\" then \"010001\" then \"000100\" then \"010001000\" maybe. Wait, let's count: the row length: It is 24 characters. They might be split into 8 groups of 3 digits each? 24/3 = 8 groups. Let's check: row numbers: \"000\", \"133\", \"010\", \"001\", \"000\", \"100\", \"010\", \"001\", \"000\"? Actually, 24 characters: 3*8 = 24 groups. Let's try to break row5 into groups of 3: \nRow5 input: \"000133010001000100010001000\". Split into groups of 3: \nGroup1: \"000\"\nGroup2: \"133\"\nGroup3: \"010\"\nGroup4: \"001\"\nGroup5: \"000\"\nGroup6: \"100\"\nGroup7: \"010\"\nGroup8: \"001\"\nGroup9: \"000\" but that's 9 groups, but 9*3=27, not 24. Let's recalc: 24 characters / 3 = 8 groups, so must be 8 groups. Let's count carefully: The string \"000133010001000100010001000\" count digits: \n- Characters: \nIndex: 1-3: \"000\"\n4-6: \"133\"\n7-9: \"010\"\n10-12: \"001\"\n13-15: \"000\"\n16-18: \"100\"\n19-21: \"010\"\n22-24: \"001\"\nThat accounts for 8 groups. So row5 is groups: [\"000\", \"133\", \"010\", \"001\", \"000\", \"100\", \"010\", \"001\"]. \nNow output row5: \"000133010001330100013301000\". Split into groups of 3: \nGroup1: \"000\"\nGroup2: \"133\"\nGroup3: \"010\"\nGroup4: \"001\"\nGroup5: \"330\"\nGroup6: \"100\"\nGroup7: \"013\"\nGroup8: \"301\"\nGroup9: \"000\"? Wait, that's 9 groups. Let's try grouping properly. Actually, check length: \"000133010001330100013301000\" length count: 3+3+3+3+3+3+3+3 = 24. So indeed there are 8 groups. Let's try splitting:\nStart: \"000\" (indices 1-3), next \"133\" (4-6), then \"010\" (7-9), then \"001\" (10-12), then \"330\" (13-15), then \"100\" (16-18), then \"013\" (19-21), then \"301\" (22-24). So groups: [\"000\", \"133\", \"010\", \"001\", \"330\", \"100\", \"013\", \"301\"].\nNow compare input groups with output groups:\nRow5 input groups: [\"000\", \"133\", \"010\", \"001\", \"000\", \"100\", \"010\", \"001\"]\nRow5 output groups: [\"000\", \"133\", \"010\", \"001\", \"330\", \"100\", \"013\", \"301\"]\n\nSo transformation: It only affected groups 5,", "prompt_tokens": 2194, "completion_tokens": 2048}

In input, rows 6-8 and row 9, etc. I see a pattern: The transformation seems to be \"drawing\" something in the middle of rows 6-12 (maybe the center of the grid, maybe the bottom half of the top half). Let's try mapping row indices: In input, row 9 was \"0000001000000000\". In output, row 9 (0-indexed?) Actually, wait: The transformation seems to have taken the numeral '1' from the input at position 9, col? Let's check: In input row 9: \"0000001000000000\". Specifically, the character '1' is at column index: There are 6 zeros, then a '1', then 7 zeros? Let's count: \"000000\" (6 zeros) then \"1\" then \"0000000\"? Actually, count: \"0000001\" then \"0000000\"? Let's check: \"0000001000000000\" length 16. Zero-based: indices 0-5 zeros, index 6 is '1', indices 7-15 zeros. So the input has a '1' at (row9, col6). Output row 9 is \"0006321236000000\". Let's check: row 9 output: \"0006321236000000\". Which columns: indices 0-2 are zeros, index3: '6'? Actually, let's index: \"0006\" then \"3221\" then \"236000000\"? That doesn't look consistent. Let's re-read the output rows carefully:\n\nE.g.1 output rows:\nRow 0: \"1236000000000000\"\nRow 1: \"5555555555555555\"\nRow 2: \"0000000000000000\"\nRow 3: \"0000000000000000\"\nRow 4: \"0000000000000000\"\nRow 5: \"0000000000000000\"\nRow 6: \"0006666666000000\"\nRow 7: \"0006333336000000\"\nRow 8: \"0006322236000000\"\nRow 9: \"0006321236000000\"\nRow 10: \"0006322236000000\"\nRow 11: \"0006333336000000\"\nRow 12: \"0006666666000000\"\nRow 13: \"0000000000000000\"\nRow 14: \"0000000000000000\"\nRow 15: \"0000000000000000\"\n\nLet's map coordinates with rows and columns:\n\nRow 0: \"1236000000000000\"\nRow 1: \"5555555555555555\"\nRow 2: \"0000000000000000\"\nRow 3: \"0000000000000000\"\nRow 4: \"0000000000000000\"\nRow 5: \"0000000000000000\"\nRow 6: \"0006666666000000\"\nRow 7: \"0006333336000000\"\nRow 8: \"0006322236000000\"\nRow 9: \"0006321236000000\"\nRow 10: \"0006322236000000\"\nRow 11: \"0006333336000000\"\nRow 12: \"0006666666000000\"\nRow 13: \"0000000000000000\"\nRow 14: \"0000000000000000\"\nRow 15: \"0000000000000000\"\n\nI see that in rows 6 to 12, there's a pattern: they start with \"000\". Then some sequence of digits \"6\", \"3\", \"2\", etc, then \"236000000\" maybe. Let's analyze the structure: the part \"236000000\" is present in rows 8-11 maybe. In row 6: \"0006666666000000\" -> after \"000\", we have \"6666666\" then \"000000\"? Actually, count: \"000\" then \"6666666\" (7 digits) then \"0000000\"? Let's count: \"000\" + \"6666666\" gives 3+7=10, then \"0000000\" gives 7, total 17, that's not 16. Let's count digits carefully:\n\n\"1236000000000000", "prompt_tokens": 967, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We have two examples. We see input and output examples. And then a test input grid. The provided input grids are given in text lines. Also the transformation rule is hidden. We need to deduce the rule from the examples and then apply it to the final test input grid.\n\nLet's see provided examples:\n\nExample E.g. 1 Input:\n```\n111111000000\n110011002200\n100001002200\n111111000000\n100001003300\n110011033330\n111111000000\n110011066660\n110011006600\n111111000000\n```\nThe corresponding output grid is:\n```\n111111\n113311\n133331\n111111\n166661\n116611\n111111\n112211\n112211\n111111\n```\nWait, but the output grid is given as lines with no spaces? But then they are not all same length? Actually example 1 output lines: \"111111\", \"113311\", \"133331\", ... but the provided input lines example 1: \"111111000000\" are 12 characters. However the output lines \"111111\" are only 6 characters. So what's going on? It seems that the transformation is to remove the second half columns. So we see the input is 12 columns but output is 6 columns. Let's check: input line \"111111000000\" becomes \"111111\" meaning the left half is kept. But then \"110011002200\" becomes \"113311\"? Let's check carefully:\n\nFirst example, input row \"110011002200\" is 12 columns, but output row \"113311\" is 6 columns. So rule might be: The grid is split in half vertically, and then some transformation is applied.\n\nLet's check E.g. 1, row by row:\n\nInput row 1: \"111111000000\" -> Output row 1: \"111111\". So left half equals output row. Row 2: \"110011002200\" -> Output row 2: \"113311\". Let's check splitting row 2 into halves: left half \"110011\", right half \"002200\". But output row \"113311\" is not simply left half. Let's observe pattern: Possibly the output is derived from the left half and the right half's digits? Wait, let me re-read the problem statement: \"Analyze the provided input/output examples and determine the transformation rule.\" They are ARC tasks: usually the transformation is based on connected components, regions, etc.\n\nMaybe the transformation rule is: For each row, we want to count the number of connected segments of the same digit in the right half, and then replicate that count somewhere, or maybe something like reading two halves and then merging them in a particular way.\n\nI recall a common ARC problem: \"ARC-14, ARC-15\" etc, but I'm not sure. Let's check sample E.g. 1 transformation in detail.\n\nLet's denote input rows as 12 columns, output rows as 6 columns. So the transformation must be something like: \"compress\" the grid's columns by summing pairs of columns or something.\n\nMaybe the rule is: For each cell in the left half of the output, its value equals the value from the left half of the input, and for the middle cells, maybe they are computed from the right half? But the output row \"113311\" for row 2: leftmost 3 columns \"113\" then \"311\"? Look at row 2 input: \"110011002200\". If we split into left half and right half: left: \"110011\", right: \"002200\". Now, maybe the transformation is: For each column, if the left half digit equals the right half digit, then output the digit; if not, then output the digit from the right half? But then row2: left half digits: 1,1,0,0,1,1; right half: 0,0,2,2,0,0. Compare them column by column:\nColumn 1: left=1, right=0, not equal -> maybe output right? But output row2 first column is 1, not 0.\nMaybe sum of digits? Let's check: column 1: 1+0=1, column2: 1+0=1, column3: 0+2=2, but output third letter is 3, not 2. Not sum.\n\nMaybe the rule is to merge two regions? Possibly it's like reading the input grid's border? Let me check: In many ARC tasks, the transformation sometimes is \"flip\" the grid horizontally or vertically, or maybe it's \"rotate\" the grid 90 degrees. But the numbers don't match.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is: The input grid is composed of two parts: the top half is a border: \"111111000000\" repeated, and then inside there is a pattern. The output grid is a 10x6 grid? Wait, check E.g. 1: How many rows? There are 10 rows in input and 10 rows in output? Actually, count input rows: They are 10 rows, and output rows: They are 10 or how many? Let's count: E.g. 1 output lines: \"111111\", \"113311\", \"133331\", \"111111\", \"166661\", \"116611\", \"111111\", \"112211\", \"112211\", \"111111\". That's 10 rows. And each row is 6 columns. So the transformation shrinks the grid horizontally by factor of 2, but vertically remains same number of rows? But check E.g. 2: Input rows: They are 14 rows maybe? Let's count E.g. 2 input lines: There are 14 lines, and output lines: \"555555\", \"551115\", \"555115\", \"555515\", \"555555\", \"522255\", \"522555\", \"525555\", \"555555\", \"535535\", \"535535\", \"533335\", \"555555\". Wait count output lines: 13 lines. And input lines: there are 14 lines? Let's count carefully E.g. 2:\nInput:\n1: 555555000000\n2: 550005030030\n3: 555005030030\n4: 555505033330\n5: 555555000000\n6: 500055022200\n7: 500555022000\n8: 505555020000\n9: 555555000000\n10: 505505001110\n11: 505505000110\n12: 500005000010\n13: 555555000000\n14: 8800800770   ??? Wait, line 14: \"8800800770\" (10 columns) \nHmm, inconsistent lengths? Let's re-read E.g. 2 input lines:\n\"555555000000\" (12 characters)\n\"550005030030\" (12)\n\"555005030030\" (12)\n\"555505033330\" (12)\n\"555555000000\" (12)\n\"500055022200\" (12)\n\"500555022000\" (12)\n\"505555020000\" (12)\n\"555555000000\" (12)\n\"505505001110\" (12)\n\"505505000110\" (12)\n\"500005000010\" (12)\n\"555555000000\" (12)\n\"8800800770\"  (10?) Actually \"8800800770\" is 10 digits, not 12.\n\"8000807770\" (10)\n\"8008807700\" (10)\n\"8888800000\" (10)\n\nSo E.g. 2 input has variable column sizes? Perhaps the input grid for E.g. 2 is not rectangular? Or maybe I mis-read the formatting. Let's re-read the provided text:\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\n555555000000\n550005030030\n555005030030\n555505033330\n555555000000\n500055022200\n500555022000\n505555020000\n555555000000\n505505001110\n505505000110\n500005000010\n555555000000\nE.g. 2 Output:\n555555\n551115\n555115\n555515\n555555\n522255\n522555\n525555\n555555\n535535\n535535\n533335\n555555\n\nSo E.g. 2 input has 14 lines? But then the output has 13 lines? Let's count: There are exactly 14 lines in E.g. 2 Input? Let's count them:\nLine1: \"555555000000\"\nLine2: \"550005030030\"\nLine3: \"555005030030\"\nLine4: \"555505033330\"\nLine5: \"555555000000\"\nLine6: \"500055022200\"\nLine7: \"500555022000\"\nLine8: \"505555020000\"\nLine9: \"555555000000\"\nLine10: \"505505001110\"\nLine11: \"505505000110\"\nLine12: \"500005000010\"\nLine13: \"555555000000\"\nLine14: ???

Let's count: Actually, count: 1: \"0000000000000000000000000\" (25 length)\n2: \"0022000000000022000000000\"\n3: \"0020001100000002000000000\"\n4: \"0000011000000000000220220\"\n5: \"0020000010000002000200020\"\n6: \"0022000000000022000000100\"\n7: \"0000000000000000000001000\"\n8: \"0000000000000000000000000\"\n9: \"0000000002202200000000000\"\n10: \"0000000002000200000200020\"\n11: \"0000000000000000000220220\"\n12: \"0000000000000000000000000\"\n13: \"0000000000000000000000000\"\n14: \"0110000000000000000000000\"\n15: \"0001000000000000000000000\"\n16: \"0000000000100000000010000\"\n17: \"0000000000011000000000000\"\n18: \"0000000000100000000000000\"\n19: \"0000000002000200000001000\"\n20: \"0000000002202200000000000\"\n21: \"0000000000000000000000000\"\n22: \"0001000000000000000000000\"\n23: \"0000000000000000000000000\"\n\nSo 23 rows. And output E.g. 1 also has 23 rows. Let's check differences:\n\nRow differences: I'll denote positions by indices maybe easier to check pattern differences.\n\nI think I should compare corresponding rows between input and output.\n\nLet's denote rows by index starting 0.\n\nRow 0: Input: \"0000000000000000000000000\" \nOutput: \"0000000000000000000000000\"\nNo differences.\n\nRow 1: Input: \"0022000000000022000000000\"\nOutput: \"0022000000000022000000000\"\nNo differences.\n\nRow 2: Input: \"0020001100000002000000000\"\nOutput: \"0020001100110002000000000\"\nDifference: The substring \"110\" in input row 2 at columns? Let's check: Input row 2: \"0020001100000002000000000\". I see \"110\" at positions maybe columns 6-8? Actually, let's count: \"00\" then \"2000\" then \"110\" then \"00000\" then \"2000000000\". More precisely, let's index columns: \nIndices: \n0: 0\n1: 0\n2: 2\n3: 0\n4: 0\n5: 0\n6: 1\n7: 1\n8: 0\n9: 0\n10:0\n11:0\n12:0\n13:0\n14: 2\n15:0\n16:0\n17:0\n18:0\n19:0\n20:0\n21:0\n22:0\n23:0\n24:0 maybe.\nWait, but lengths might be 25 characters. Let's count: The string \"0020001100000002000000000\" length? Count manually: \n\"00\" (2) + \"2000\" (4) -> 6, then \"110\" (3) => 9, then \"00000\" (5) => 14, then \"2000000000\" (10) => 24, so total 24? Wait, let's count properly: It says \"0022000000000022000000000\" has length? Count digits: It might be 25 digits if there is a trailing digit? Let's count: \"0022000000000022000000000\". Count manually: Characters: \n0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. That's 25 digits. Similarly, \"0020001100000002000000000\" should be 25 digits.\nLet's count \"0020001100000002000000000\":\nCharacters: \n0,0,2,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0? Wait, I need to count carefully.\nI can count by grouping: Possibly given digits are not too important.\n\nI see that the difference is that in output row2, at the portion corresponding to the \"110\" segment, now it becomes \"110\" but then later \"0011\"? Wait, in output row2: \"0020001100110002000000000\". Compare to input row2: \"0020001100000002000000000\". So the difference is in the middle segment: input has \"...110000000...\" and output has \"...110110000...\"? Let's check: \nInput row2: \"0020001100000002000000000\"\nOutput row2: \"0020001100110002000000000\"\nSo difference from column 9? Let's align:\n\"00200011\" then \"0000002000000000\" vs \"00200011\" then \"10011000200000000\". Actually, let's align characters:\nInput: 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput: 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nSo difference: at positions 9 and 10? Let's see: \nposition: index: \n0:0,1:0,2:2,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:1,7:1.\nAt index 8: both are 0.\nAt", "prompt_tokens": 1883, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's check lengths: \"111111111\" is 9 characters, \"131111141\" is 9 characters, etc. So the transformation from a 23x20 input to a 10x9 output. So what's the rule? It appears to be some form of extraction or reordering.\n\nLet's look at differences. The input has a specific pattern: There is a border of zeros in some rows. The output digits are \"1\" and \"3\", \"8\", etc. It might be that the rule is to extract a subgrid of \"1\" characters maybe from the original grid? Let's compare positions. In example 1, the output is 10 rows x 9 columns. The output includes digits: \"1\", \"3\", \"8\", \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", etc.\n\nI suspect the transformation is \"mirroring\" of a pattern along the diagonals? But let's check pattern of digits.\n\nI see in example 1, the input contains a shape that seems to be like a closed shape with some numbers inside. In the input the printed numbers are: There are digits \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"8\". In output, we see \"1\", \"3\", \"8\". Could it be that the transformation eliminates the boundary zeros and extracts the \"spine\" of the shape? Possibly it's a \"skeletonization\" of the pattern.\n\nObserving the input grid of example 1, the only non-zero digits are in rows 2-10 maybe? Let's check rows:\n\nRow2: \"0011111111110000000\"\nSo non-zero part is \"01111111111\", but the zeros at beginning and end.\nRow3: \"0012111111410000000\" -> \"012111111141\" with zeros at both ends.\nRow4: \"0011111811110000000\" -> \"011111811110\"\nRow5: \"0011188818110000000\" -> \"011188811110\"\nRow6: \"0011181111110000000\" -> \"011118111110\"\nRow7: \"0011188881110000000\" -> \"011118888111\"\nRow8: \"0011811181110000000\" -> \"011811181110\"\nRow9: \"0011111111310000000\" -> \"011111111131\"\nRow10: \"0011111111110000000\" -> \"011111111111\"\nRows 11-14 are all zeros.\nRow15: \"0000000030000040000\" -> has pattern \"3\" then \"00000\" then \"4\"? Actually \"0000000030000040000\" has a \"3\" in column 7? Let's re-read: \"0000000030000040000\": There are 6 zeros, then a 3, then 3 zeros, then a 4, then 4 zeros. \nRows 16-20 are zeros.\nRow21: \"0000000000000000000\"\nRow22: \"0000000000000020000\" -> has \"2\" in column? \"0000000000000020000\": first 12 zeros, then \"2\", then \"0000\"? Actually check: \"0000000000000020000\" can be segmented: 12 zeros, then \"2\", then \"0000\"? Actually let's count: \"0000000000000020000\" is 20 characters, so maybe there's a \"2\" at column 13? Wait, let's count positions: 1-indexed: characters 1-12 are zeros, then char 13 is \"2\", then char 14 is \"0\", then char 15 is \"0\", then char 16 is \"0\", then char 17 is \"0\". That doesn't match the output pattern though.\n\nBut the output only has 10 rows, so maybe they are cropping the input to a bounding box that encloses the non-zero digits. In example 1, the non-zero digits appear in rows 2 to 10 possibly, but the ones on row 15? Actually row15 is \"0000000030000040000\", which has a 3 at col 7 and 4 at col 11? Wait, recalc row15: \"0000000030000040000\". Count: positions: \n- 1-6: \"000000\"\n- 7: \"3\"\n- 8-10: \"000\"\n- 11: \"4\"\n- 12-20: \"0000000\" but wait 12-20 would be 9 digits. Let's recalc: \"0000000030000040000\" length=20.", "prompt_tokens": 1346, "completion_tokens": 2048}

{"task_id": "94414823", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "microsoft/phi-4-reasoning-plus:free", "raw_response": "We are given several examples. Let me restate the problem in my own words.\n\nWe have an ARC problem where we have input grids and output grids. We are provided with three example pairs (E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3) and then one test input grid. The examples show a transformation rule that is applied to the grid. The grid is a 10x10 grid, with digits represented as ASCII strings. The digits themselves are from 0 to 9. They show patterns of \"0055555500\" and \"0050000500\" rows, with \"0000000000\" boundaries all around.\n\nI need to deduce the transformation rule that gets the input grid to the output grid. Let me note the differences in each example.\n\nLet's denote coordinates: rows 0 to 9, columns 0 to 9. The examples are similar. Let me re-read them.\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nRow0: \"0000000000\"\nRow1: \"0400000080\"\nRow2: \"0055555500\"\nRow3: \"0050000500\"\nRow4: \"0050000500\"\nRow5: \"0050000500\"\nRow6: \"0050000500\"\nRow7: \"0055555500\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nRow0: \"0000000000\"\nRow1: \"0400000080\"\nRow2: \"0055555500\"\nRow3: \"0054488500\"\nRow4: \"0054488500\"\nRow5: \"0058844500\"\nRow6: \"0058844500\"\nRow7: \"0055555500\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nObservations:\n- The central region (rows 2-7) that originally had \"0055555500\" at row2 and row7, and \"0050000500\" in rows 3-6, become modified. The transformation appears to modify the middle digits from 5 or 0 to other numbers. Specifically, in row2, the center digits remain 5 (maybe they are not changed). But then row3 and row4 become \"0054488500\". And row5 and row6 become \"0058844500\". So it seems that transformation rule when applied to the center region. But what rule exactly?\n\nLet's check differences between input and output:\n\nLooking at row3: Input row3: \"0050000500\"\nOutput row3: \"0054488500\"\nSo differences:\n- The third digit: originally '0'? Actually let's index columns: columns 0 to 9.\nRow3: \"0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\". I assume the region is columns 2 to 7 maybe.\nBut changes:\nColumn positions:\n Index: 0: '0' remains unchanged.\n Index: 1: '0' remains unchanged.\n Index: 2: '5' remains unchanged? Actually, output row3: \"0054488500\"\n- index 2: '0'? Actually let me re-read: \"0050000500\" means: digit at index 2 is '5'? Wait, let me re-read the string carefully:\n\nFor row3 input: \"0050000500\"\nIndices:\n0: '0'\n1: '0'\n2: '5'\n3: '0'\n4: '0'\n5: '0'\n6: '0'\n7: '5'\n8: '0'\n9: '0'\nNow for row3 output: \"0054488500\"\nIndices:\n0: '0'\n1: '0'\n2: '5'\n3: '4'\n4: '4'\n5: '8'\n6: '8'\n7: '5'\n8: '0'\n9: '0'\n\nSo the transformation changed digits at columns 3,4,5,6. They were originally \"0000\" and become \"4488\". Similarly, row4 input: \"0050000500\" becomes \"0054488500\". So same transformation as row3.\nRow5 input: \"0050000500\" becomes \"0058844500\". That means that the block of digits at columns 3,4,5,6 becomes \"8844\" instead of \"4488\".\nRow6 input: \"0050000500\" becomes \"0058844500\".\n\nRow2 and row7 remain same \"0055555500\", i.e., the top and bottom of the inner region remain as is. So the transformation is applied to the inner rows that are not the top and bottom row of the region, specifically rows 3,4,5,6. The transformation rule seems to involve \"mirroring\" or \"layering\" of digits. We see pattern: \nRow3 and row4: \"0054488500\"\nRow5 and row6: \"0058844500\"\n\nLooking at row3 vs row5:\n- The left half of the inner block (columns 3,4) becomes \"44\" in row3 and \"88\" in row5.\n- The right half (columns 5,6) becomes \"88\" in row3 and \"44\" in row5.\nWait, check: row3: digits (3,4,5,6) = \"4488\"\nRow5: digits (3,4,5,6) = \"8844\"\nSo it seems that the transformation is swapping the pairs on the two halves, or maybe it's applying some filling pattern.\n\nLet's compare row3 and row5 outputs. They are symmetric vertically? Because row3 and row4 are one pair, and row5 and row6 are the other pair. But not exactly symmetric across the center rows; they are different. It might be that the rule involves \"spiral\" or \"concentric\" pattern. Possibly the rule involves reading the digits on the border of the inner region, then filling the interior with a gradient that depends on distance from the border? But then row2 and row7 are not changed, they remain 5's. And row1 and row8 are unchanged as well. Only the inner rows (3,4,5,6) are changed. And what about the columns? The columns that are being changed are columns 3 to 7? Actually, let's check columns: The original pattern \"0050000500\": columns 2 is 5, column 7 is 5, and the inner four columns (3,4,5,6) become changed. So the transformation appears to modify the inner block of four columns that are exactly in the center of the 10 columns? Wait, but then why not the columns outside? Let's check:\nRow3 output: \"0054488500\"\nIndex breakdown:\ncol0: 0\ncol1: 0\ncol2: 5 (unchanged)\ncol3: 4\ncol4: 4\ncol5: 8\ncol6: 8\ncol7: 5 (unchanged)\ncol8: 0\ncol9: 0\n\nSimilarly row4 output: same.\nRow5 output: \"0058844500\"\nRow6 output: same.\n\nSo the transformation rule seems to operate on the 4 inner columns (col3-6) of the rows 3-6. But why these columns? Possibly because they are the \"active\" area. And then what is the rule? Looking at row3 and row4, the transformation replaced the block \"0000\" with \"4488\". And in row5 and row6, it replaced with \"8844\". So perhaps the rule is: For rows 3-6, replace the sub-block with two copies of a pair, where the pair for row3 and row4 is \"44\" then \"88\", and for row5 and row6 is \"88\" then \"44\". But wait, what about e.g. 2 and e.g. 3 examples?\n\nLet's check E.g. 2. E.g. 2 Input:\nRow0: \"0000000000\"\nRow1: \"0000000060\"\nRow2: \"0055555500\"\nRow3: \"0050000500\"\nRow4: \"0050000500\"\nRow5: \"0050000500\"\nRow6: \"0050000500\"\nRow7: \"0055555500\"\nRow8: \"0000000070\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nE.g. 2 Output:\nRow0: \"0000000000\"\nRow1: \"0000000060\"\nRow2: \"0055555500\"\nRow3: \"0057766500\"\nRow4: \"0057766500\"\nRow5: \"0056677500\"\nRow6: \"0056677500\"\nRow7: \"0055555500\"\nRow8: \"0000000070\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nNow compare row3 in E.g. 2:\nInput row3: \"0050000500\"\nOutput row3: \"0057766500\"\nSo the transformation for E.g. 2 in the inner block (columns 3-6) becomes \"7766\"? Let's check: row3: \"0057766500\"\nIndices: col0: 0, col1: 0, col2: 5, col3: 7, col4: 7, col5: 6, col6: 6, col7: 5, col8: 0, col9: 0.\nRow4 is the same.\nRow5: \"0056677500\": inner block \"6677\".\nRow", "prompt_tokens": 771, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We have two examples (E.g. 1 and E.g. 2) each with input and output. They represent hidden transformation rules. The test input is given. We need to determine transformation rule from provided examples and then produce test output grid.\n\nLet's re-read examples.\n\nWe have: e.g. 1 Input grid and e.g. 1 Output grid. They are different. Look for differences.\n\nLet's denote e.g. 1 input and output. The input grid is a 17x16 grid? Wait, count rows. Actually, re-read:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\n\nRow by row:\nLine1: \"0000000000000\" -> length is 13 characters? Actually wait, count \"0000000000000\" appears to be 13 digits. Check: \"0000000000000\" is 13 zeros. The next line \"0041600000000\" is 13 digits as well? Wait, must count properly.\nLet's count digits: \"0000000000000\" -> count: There are 13 zeros? Actually \"0000000000000\" count digits: There are 13 zeros if it's printed as text.\nWait, the puzzle usually is 12x12 or similar? Let's recalc: Actually, let me count: \"0000000000000\" -> count digits: it's \"0\" repeated 13 times. Next: \"0041600000000\" -> digits: \"0\", \"0\", \"4\", \"1\", \"6\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\". So that's 13 digits. So e.g. 1 input grid is 13 columns x 17 rows? But then output grid: first row \"0000000000000\" is same length 13. But then second row \"0000000000000\" is 13 zeros. Third row \"0004444000000\" is 13 digits, etc. So grid dimensions in e.g.1: rows: count them:\nInput e.g. 1 lines:\n1: 0000000000000\n2: 0041600000000\n3: 0041600000000\n4: 0041600000000\n5: 0000000000000\n6: 0000000000000\n7: 0000000000000\n8: 0001111000000\n9: 0001001000000\n10: 0111001110000\n11: 0011001100000\n12: 0011111100000\n13: 0006666000000\n14: 0006006000000\n15: 0666006660000\n16: 0066006600000\n17: 0066666600000\n\nSo dimensions: 17 rows x 13 columns.\nOutput e.g.1 lines:\n1: 0000000000000 (13 zeros)\n2: 0000000000000 (13 zeros)\n3: 0004444000000\n4: 0004004000000\n5: 0444004440000\n6: 0044004400000\n7: 0044444400000\n8: 0001111000000\n9: 0001001000000\n10: 0111001110000\n11: 0011001100000\n12: 0011111100000\n13: 0006666000000\n14: 0006006000000\n15: 0666006660000\n16: 0066006600000\n17: 0066666600000\n\nThus differences: In e.g.1, input vs output: The first 2 rows are all zeros in output, but input had row2 \"0041600000000\". So transformation: row2 changed from \"0041600000000\" to \"0000000000000\". Row3 input \"0041600000000\" becomes \"0004444000000\". Row4 input \"0041600000000\" becomes \"0004004000000\". Row5 input \"0000000000000\" becomes \"0444004440000\". Row6 input \"0000000000000\" becomes \"0044004400000\". Row7 input \"0000000000000\" becomes \"0044444400000\". Then rows 8-12 remain same? Actually check row8: input \"0001111000000\", output same \"0001111000000\". Row9: same. Row10: same. Row11: same. Row12: same.\nThen rows 13-17 remain same. So changes are only in rows 2-7. So transformation seems to be applied to a subgrid region? Let's check pattern coordinates:\n\nThe changed region in e.g.1: rows 2 to 7? Actually rows indices:\nRow2: changed from 0041600000000 to 0000000000000.\nRow3: changed from 0041600000000 to 0004444000000.\nRow4: changed from 0041600000000 to 0004004000000.\nRow5: changed from 0000000000000 to 0444004440000.\nRow6: changed from 0000000000000 to 0044004400000.\nRow7: changed from 0000000000000 to 0044444400000.\n\nThe unchanged region: rows 8-12, rows 13-17 remain same. So maybe transformation is applied to a 6-row block? But then what columns? Let's look at columns: It might be that the block that is transformed is the one containing digits 4, 1, 6 maybe? For instance, row2 input: \"0041600000000\". Perhaps the block is columns 3-5? Wait, let's compare row2 input and output:\nInput row2: \"0 0 4 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". Output row2: \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So row2: the block \"416\" in positions 3,4,5 changed to zeros.\nRow3 input: \"0 0 4 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" becomes output row3: \"0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\". So block \"416\" becomes \"444\"? Actually positions: The output row3: digits: index1:0, index2:0, then index3:0, index4:4, index5:4, index6:4, then rest zeros. Row4 input: \"0041600000000\" becomes output row4: \"0004004000000\". So block \"416\" becomes \"004\"? Actually check: row4: input \"0041600000000\": digits: positions: 0,0,4,1,6,0,... output row4: \"0004004000000\": digits: index1:0, index2:0, index3:0, index4:4, index5:0, index6:0, then index7:4, index8:0, then zeros. So transformation on row4: block \"416\" (3-5) becomes \"0 4 0\" then maybe there's a second block \"000\"? Not sure.\nWait, perhaps the transformation is not simply replacing a block, but there might be multiple blocks. Let's check row5: input row5: \"0000000000000\" becomes output row5: \"0444004440000\". So new digits appear at positions? \"0444004440000\": digits: index1:0, index2:0, index3:4, index4:4, index5:4, index6:0, index7:0, index8:4, index9:4, index10:4, then zeros. So row5 has two groups: group1: columns 3-5 become \"444\" and group2: columns 8-10 become \"444\". And row6: input \"0000000000000\" becomes \"0044004400000\": digits: index1:0, index2:0, index3:4, index4:4, index5:0, index6:0, index7:4, index8:4, index9:0, index10:0, then zeros. Row7: input \"0000000000000\" becomes \"0044444400000\": digits: index1:0, index2:0, index3:4, index4:4, index5:4, index6:4, index7:4, index8:4, then zeros.\n\nThis pattern is reminiscent of \"drawing\" some shape maybe like a plus sign? The digits \"4\" appear in a pattern that suggests maybe the transformation is to \"mirror\" or \"reflect\" the pattern of 4's from one part of the grid. Let's check e.g. 2 differences.\n\nE.g. 2 Input grid:\nIt has many rows. I'll count rows:\nRows:\n1: \"00000000000000\" (14 zeros) \n2: \"00000007213000\" (14 digits, with digits: 0,0,0,0,0,0,7,2,1,3,0,0,0,0) \n3: \"00000007213000\" same as row2.\n4", "prompt_tokens": 935, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Our goal is to deduce transformation rule. We are given three examples with transformation outputs. Let's denote examples as E.g.1, E.g.2, E.g.3, and then test input. We'll analyze patterns.\n\nLet's restate examples:\n\nE.g.1 Input:\n```\n0002500205000\n2000502005000\n0000202005000\n0000500005000\n2555555525555\n0200502005000\n0020500205020\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n5555555555255\n0000500005000\n0200502005000\n0000500005002\n0000500005000\n5555555555555\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n0000500005200\n```\nE.g.1 Output:\n```\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n5555255552555\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n5555255552555\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n5555255552555\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n0000500005000\n```\n\nObservations: \n- The input grid has 19 lines. The output grid has same number of lines. \n- There is a pattern: most rows become identical pattern: \"0000500005000\". The only differences are in some rows at positions where input had \"25555555...\" etc. Let's check differences.\n\nObserving E.g.1: \nRow 1: input: \"0002500205000\" output: \"0000500005000\". \nSo transformation: \"250\" becomes \"050\"? Actually, row 1 in input: \"0002500205000\". Output row 1: \"0000500005000\". So, what changed? There is difference in column positions. Let's check columns.\nWait, the grid is not square? But each row has length 13? Actually count: \"0002500205000\" is 13 characters. And output \"0000500005000\" is also 13 characters. So grid dimensions: 19 rows x 13 columns. \n\nLet's compare changes row by row:\nRow1: Input: \"0002500205000\", Output: \"0000500005000\".\nDifference: In input, there is digit \"2\" at col? Let's index columns from 0 to 12:\nInput row1: \ncol0:0, col1:0, col2:0, col3:2, col4:5, col5:0, col6:0, col7:2, col8:0, col9:5, col10:0, col11:0, col12:0.\nOutput row1: \"0000500005000\": \ncol0:0, col1:0, col2:0, col3:0, col4:5, col5:0, col6:0, col7:0, col8:0, col9:5, col10:0, col11:0, col12:0.\nSo the difference is that at col3, input digit \"2\" becomes \"0\". Also at col4, input digit \"5\" vs output digit \"5\" are same; but then col? Wait, let's compare columns:\n\nComparing corresponding columns:\n- col0: 0 vs 0\n- col1: 0 vs 0\n- col2: 0 vs 0\n- col3: 2 vs 0: changed from 2 to 0.\n- col4: 5 vs 5: same.\n- col5: 0 vs 0.\n- col6: 0 vs 0.\n- col7: 2 vs 0: changed from 2 to 0.\n- col8: 0 vs 0.\n- col9: 5 vs 5.\n- col10: 0 vs 0.\n- col11: 0 vs 0.\n- col12: 0 vs 0.\n\nSo row1: two \"2\" digits become zero. Look at row2:\nRow2: Input: \"2000502005000\". Output: \"0000500005000\".\nLet's index:\nInput row2: \ncol0:2, col1:0, col2:0, col3:0, col4:5, col5:0, col6:2, col7:0, col8:0, col9:5, col10:0, col11:0, col12:0.\nOutput row2: \"0000500005000\".\nComparison: col0:2 vs 0, changed to 0.\ncol1 remains 0, col2 remains 0, col3 remains 0, col4: same, col5: same, col6: 2 vs 0, changed.\nSo row2: the digits \"2\" are replaced with \"0\" in positions that originally had \"2\".\n\nRow3: Input: \"0000202005000\". Output: \"0000500005000\".\nRow3: Input: digits: \"0,0,0,0,2,0,2,0,0,5,0,0,0\". Output: \"0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0\". So the digit in col4 changed from 2 to 5? Actually check: For row3, col4 input: '2'? Wait, no: row3: \"0000202005000\": digits: col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=0, col4=2, col5=0, col6=2, col7=0, col8=0, col9=5, col10=0, col11=0, col12=0. Output row3: \"0000500005000\": digits: col0=0, col1=0, col2=0, col3=0, col4=5, col5=0, col6=0, col7=0, col8=0, col9=5, col10=0, col11=0, col12=0.\nSo row3: two changes: col4: 2 becomes 5, col6: 2 becomes 0. But wait, check row1 and row2: They changed 2 to 0. So row3: the first 2 becomes 5. But why? Let's re-read row3 input: \"0000202005000\". Actually, maybe I'm misinterpreting: Look at row1: \"0002500205000\" changed to \"0000500005000\". The differences were columns 3 and 7 changed. Row2: \"2000502005000\" changed to \"0000500005000\", differences columns 0 and 6. Row3: \"0000202005000\" changed to \"0000500005000\", differences columns? Let's recalc carefully row3:\nRow3 input: \"0000202005000\". I want to index digits by positions:\n- digits: \"0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 5 0 0 0\"\n- Compare with output: \"0000500005000\": \"0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\"\nSo the only difference is col4: input '2' becomes output '5', and col6: input '2' becomes output '0'. That is inconsistent with previous rows where 2 always became 0. But maybe the transformation is not simply replacing 2 with 0 everywhere. Let's check row4 input: \"0000500005000\" output: \"0000500005000\". Row4: no difference.\nRow5: Input: \"2555555525555\", Output: \"5555255552555\". Let's index row5:\nInput row5: \"2555555525555\". Let's break it: digits: \"2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5\"? Wait, count: row5 input is 14 characters? Actually, wait, row5 input: \"2555555525555\". Count digits: 14? But earlier rows had 13. Let's re-read E.g.1 input rows:\nRow1: \"0002500205000\" (13)\nRow2: \"2000502005000\" (13)\nRow3: \"0000202005000\" (13)\nRow4: \"0000500005000\" (13)\nRow5: \"2555555525555\" (14? Let's count: \"2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5\"? That is 13 digits if I count: \"2\" then \"5555555\" then \"2\" then \"5555\". Actually \"2555555525555\" count digits: 1:2, 2:5, 3:5, 4:5, 5:5, 6:5, 7:5, 8:5, 9:2, 10:", "prompt_tokens": 1541, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's compare input and output.\n\nObservations:\n- In row 0, input \"11000000000\", output \"11000003300\". So, the digits \"33\" appear in positions 6-7? Wait, let's map indices: string indices:\nIndex positions: 0,1,2,... etc.\nRow 0: Input \"11000000000\". Output \"11000003300\". So digits at positions 6 and 7? Check: Output: 1,1,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0,0. So row 0 becomes \"33\" inserted at indices 6-7. Similarly, row 1: Input \"01110000000\" becomes \"01110333000\". So digits become \"333\" in the middle? Let's check row 1: \"01110 000000\". Actually, \"01110333000\" string: index: 0:0,1:1,2:1,3:1,4:0, then 3, then 3, then 3, then 0,0,0,0? Let's check carefully: row1 input: \"01110000000\" (11 digits) with indices: 0:0,1:1,2:1,3:1,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0? Actually, wait, count length: The grid in E.g. 1 is 11 characters? Let's count: \"11000000000\" is 11 characters. So indices: 0-10.\nRow 0: input \"11000000000\", output \"11000003300\": positions: 0:1,1:1, then 0,0,0,0, then digits \"33\", then \"00\". So transformation: appended some numbers. Row 1: input \"01110000000\", output \"01110333000\": So digits \"3\" appear inserted? It seems like we are filling some region with \"3\". \nRow 2: input \"01000003000\" remains same output \"01000003000\": exactly same. \nRow 3: input \"01110000000\" becomes \"01110333000\", similar to row 1.\nRow 4: input \"00000000000\" output \"00000000000\": no change.\nRow 5: input \"00000000000\" output \"00000000000\": no change.\nRow 6: input \"00000000000\" output \"00000000000\": no change.\nRow 7: input \"00000000000\" output \"08880000000\". So row 7 gets \"08880000000\". \nRow 8: input \"00000000000\" output \"08000000000\".\nRow 9: input \"00000000000\" output \"08880000000\".\nRow 10: input \"80000000000\" output \"88000000000\". \n\nSo pattern in E.g. 1: It seems that some \"3\" digits appear in some region, and some \"8\" digits appear appended in lower rows. Let's check potential shape: The input grid has a shape maybe like a cross shape? Looking at rows 0,1,2,3, maybe a pattern with a \"T\" shape? But not sure.\n\nLet's look at E.g. 2:\nInput (E.g. 2):\nRows:\n0: 00000000000\n1: 00000000000\n2: 00000000000\n3: 00000000000\n4: 01100000000\n5: 00100000060\n6: 01111000000\n7: 00000000000\n8: 00000000000\n9: 00000000000\n10: 00000000000\n11: 00000000000\nOutput (E.g. 2):\n0: 00000000000\n1: 00000000000\n2: 00000000000\n3: 00000000000\n4: 01100000066\n5: 00100000060\n6: 01111006666\n7: 00000000000\n8: 00000000000\n9: 00000000000\n10: 00000000000\n11: 00000000000\n\nComparing row 4: Input \"01100000000\", output \"01100000066\". So last two digits become 66. Row 5: remains \"00100000060\". Row 6: input \"01111000000\" becomes \"01111006666\". So it seems that in the bottom part of the shape, extra digits \"6\" are appended. The \"6\" digits appear in row 4 and row 6. Also row 5 had a \"60\" at end? No, row 5 input had \"00060\" at end? Let's re-read row 5 input: \"00100000060\". Output row 5 remains \"00100000060\". So transformation rule: In some rows, the \"6\" appears appended to the right side, maybe turning some \"0\" digits to \"6\"? In row 6, last four digits become \"6666\" instead of \"0000\", while row 4, last two digits become \"66\" instead of \"00\". So rule: There is a shape that has a \"border\" of ones maybe? Wait, then check E.g. 3:\nE.g. 3 Input:\nRow 0: 000000000000 (12 digits)\nRow 1: 000010000000\nRow 2: 001010000000\nRow 3: 001111100000\nRow 4: 000100000000\nRow 5: 000000000000\nRow 6: 000000000000\nRow 7: 000000000000\nRow 8: 000002000000\nRow 9: 000000000000\nRow 10: 000000000000\nRow 11: 000000000000\n\nOutput E.g. 3:\nRow 0: 000000000000\nRow 1: 000010000000 (unchanged)\nRow 2: 001010000000 (unchanged)\nRow 3: 001111100000 (unchanged)\nRow 4: 000100000000 (unchanged)\nRow 5: 000000000000 (unchanged)\nRow 6: 000000000000 (unchanged)\nRow 7: 000200000000 (changed: row 7 becomes \"000200000000\" from \"000000000000\")\nRow 8: 002222200000 (changed: row 8 becomes \"002222200000\" from \"000002000000\")\nRow 9: 002020000000 (changed: row 9 becomes \"002020000000\" from \"000000000000\")\nRow 10: 000020000000 (changed: row 10 becomes \"000020000000\" from \"000000000000\")\nRow 11: 000000000000 (unchanged)\n\nSo here, transformation occurred at rows 7, 8, 9, 10. In these rows, digits \"2\" appear. More precisely:\n- Row 8: originally \"000002000000\", becomes \"002222200000\": The \"2\" digit appears in the middle group, but also the right side? Let's check: \"000002000000\" -> \"002222200000\". So positions: originally, there is a \"2\" at index 5? Actually, count digits: 12 digits. Let's index them 0..11.\nRow 8 input: \"000002000000\". That means: indices: 0:0,1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:2,6:0,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0.\nOutput row 8: \"002222200000\": indices: 0:0,1:0,2:2,3:2,4:2,5:2,6:2,7:2,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0.\nSo it seems that the single \"2\" at index 5 got expanded to a block of \"2\" spanning indices 2 to 7 maybe.\n- Row 7: input \"000000000000\" becomes \"000200000000\": So a single \"2\" inserted at index 3? Wait, check row 7: \"000200000000\": that means index", "prompt_tokens": 1051, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We need to analyze the transformation rules based on differences between input and output.\n\nNow, let's re-read the problem text. It's \"Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) problems\" and the instructions mention \"deduce transformation rule\" from examples. The examples are 3x3? Actually, they are grids of various dimensions. The provided examples are input and output pairs. We need to identify pattern.\n\nLet's check E.g 1:\n\nInput E.g. 1:\nLine lengths: They all appear to be 20 characters (0-9 digits?) but careful: They are \"00000000000000000000\" lines.

The output example has also 12 lines of 20 columns.\n\nE.g. 1 Input grid:\nRow0: \"00000000000000000000\"\nRow1: \"00000000000000000000\"\nRow2: \"0000003000000300000010\"\nRow3: \"2000003000000300000010\"\nRow4: \"0000003001000300010010\"\nRow5: \"0000000001000000010000\"\nRow6: \"0000000001000000010000\"\nRow7: \"0000000000000000000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000000000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000000000000000\"\nRow10: \"0000000000000000000000\"\nRow11: \"0000000000000000000000\"\n\nE.g. 1 Output grid:\nRow0: \"00000000000000000000\"\nRow1: \"0000000000000000000222\"\nRow2: \"0000003000000300000210\"\nRow3: \"2222223022222300222210\"\nRow4: \"0000023021002300210010\"\nRow5: \"0000022221002222210000\"\nRow6: \"0000000001000000010000\"\nRow7: \"0000000000000000000000\"\nRow8: \"0000000000000000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000000000000000\"\nRow10: \"0000000000000000000000\"\nRow11: \"0000000000000000000000\"\n\nI need to compare differences between input and output in E.g. 1.\n\nObservations for E.g. 1:\n- The digits in the grid: It seems the digits are mostly 0, but there are occurrences of 1, 2, 3, etc.\n- In input, there are digits: 3, 0, and sometimes 1 appear.\n- In output, additional 2's appear in some rows, replaced some 0's.\n\nLet's compare row by row.\n\nRow0: Input: \"00000000000000000000\", Output: \"00000000000000000000\". No change.\n\nRow1: Input: \"00000000000000000000\", Output: \"0000000000000000000222\". The last 3 digits changed from \"000\" to \"222\". So row1 bottom-most 3 columns got replaced with 2's.\nRow2: Input: \"0000003000000300000010\", Output: \"0000003000000300000210\". In row2, the last digit became 1 replaced by 0? Wait check: Actually, row2 input: \"0000003000000300000010\", output: \"0000003000000300000210\". So the last digit changed from 10 to 210? Let's see: Actually, the difference is on the rightmost part: \"0010\" becomes \"0210\". So the second last digit changed from 0 to 2? However, check: \"0010\" -> \"0210\", so the third digit from the right changed from 0 to 2? Actually, let's index columns from left (0-indexed): row2: columns 0-19. The input row2: \"0000003000000300000010\". The substring \"0010\" at the end, columns 16-19 perhaps. The output row2: \"0000003000000300000210\". So the difference is that column 17 changed from 0 to 2. So row2, column 17 changed to 2. \nRow3: Input: \"2000003000000300000010\", Output: \"2222223022222300222210\". Let's compare carefully:\nInput row3: \"2000003000000300000010\"\nOutput row3: \"2222223022222300222210\"\nLet's break in segments: \nSegment left: \"2000003000000300000010\"\nOutput left: \"2222223022222300222210\"\nIt seems like the transformation changed some 0's to 2's in some pattern. Notably, the leftmost digit changed from 2 to 2? Actually, input row3 first char is \"2\", output row3 first char is \"2\", so that remains.\nThen \"00000\" in input became \"22222\" in output. So that part changed 0's to 2's. Then \"3\" remains \"3\". Then \"00000\" becomes \"22222\". Then \"3\" remains \"3\". Then \"00000\" becomes \"22222\"? Let's check: after the third \"3\", then \"00000\" becomes \"02222\"? Wait, check carefully: Output row3: \"2222223022222300222210\". Let's break it into groups with indices:\nInput row3: \nCol0: 2\nCols1-5: 00000\nCol6: 3\nCols7-11: 00000\nCol12: 3\nCols13-17: 00000? Actually, input row3: \"2000003000000300000010\"\nIndex: \n0: 2\n1-5: 00000\n6: 3\n7-11: 00000\n12: 3\n13-17: 00000? Wait, check: Actually, string length is 20. Let's re-read row3 exactly: \"2000003000000300000010\". Count: \nindex: 0:2, 1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:3,7:0,8:0,9:0,10:0,11:0,12:3,13:0,14:0,15:0,16:0,17:0,18:1,19:0.\nNow output row3: \"2222223022222300222210\". \nLet's label output indices:\n0:2,\n1:2,\n2:2,\n3:2,\n4:2,\n5:2,\n6:3,\n7:0? Actually, \"2222223022222300222210\" reading carefully: It might be: \"2222223\" then \"0222223\" then \"0222210\". Let's try to split: maybe first 7 characters \"2222223\" then next 7 \"0222223\" then last 6 \"022210\"? Let's re-read: \"2222223022222300222210\". I'll index manually:\nIndices:\n0: 2\n1: 2\n2: 2\n3: 2\n4: 2\n5: 2\n6: 3\n7: 0? But then digit at index 7: The 8th character is \"0\"? Actually, let's get substring: \"2222223\" is first 7, then next 7 \"0222223\", then last 6 \"022210\"? But that doesn't add up to 20 if we get 7+7+6=20. Let's try: 7+7+6=20, yes.\nSo output row3: \nIndices 0-6: \"2222223\"\nIndices 7-13: \"0222223\"\nIndices 14-19: \"022210\"\nNow compare with input row3:\nIndices 0-5: \"200000\" vs output indices 0-5: \"222222\" (so every 0 becomes 2 except maybe the initial 2 remains? Actually, index0: was 2, now 2, indices 1-5: originally 0 become 2)\nIndex6: input:3, output:3.\nIndices 7-11: input: \"00000\", output: indices 7-11: \"02222\"? Actually, careful: output row3 indices 7-11: \"02222\"? Because \"0222223\" means indices 7-11: \"02222\" and index12: \"3\". Let's recalc: \"0222223\" is 7 characters, so indices 7: 0, 8:2, 9:2, 10:2, 11:2, 12:2, 13:3. But input row3 indices 7-11: \"00000\", index12: 3, index13:", "prompt_tokens": 1442, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let me count columns in first output: \"22222222222220000\". Count: digits: It appears 17 digits? Let's count: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0 = 17 digits.\n\nSo grid size is 21 rows, 17 columns.\n\nI need to compare and deduce transformation rule. Looking at E.g. 1, differences: The pattern \"08880888088808880\" appears frequently. It seems the transformation might be doing some symmetrical replacement in some rows.\n\nObserving rows that changed: In E.g. 1 Input, row 1 is \"08880888088808880\". In E.g. 1 Output, row 2 is \"28880888088828880\". Wait, let's re-check row indexes carefully:\n\nLet's index rows from 0 to 20.\n\nMapping E.g. 1 input rows:\nRow0: \"20000000000000000\"\nRow1: \"08880888088808880\"\nRow2: \"08080808080808080\"\nRow3: \"08880888088808880\"\nRow4: \"00000000000000000\"\nRow5: \"08880888088808880\"\nRow6: \"08080808080808080\"\nRow7: \"08880888088808880\"\nRow8: \"00000000000020000\"\nRow9: \"08880888088808880\"\nRow10:\"08080808080808080\"\nRow11:\"08880888088808880\"\nRow12:\"00000000000000000\"\nRow13:\"08880888088808880\"\nRow14:\"08080808080808080\"\nRow15:\"08880888088808880\"\nRow16:\"000000000000", "prompt_tokens": 1254, "completion_tokens": 2048}

Let's compare Input and Output row by row.\n\nFor first few rows (before row 5) remain the same. Row 1 input: \"00008888888888800000000000000\". Output row 1 same. Row 2: \"00088888888888880000000000000\" vs output row 2 same. Row 3: input \"00888888888888888000000000000\", output same. Row 4: \"08888888888888888800000000000\", output same.\nRow 5: input \"08888888888888888800000000000\", output: \"48888888888888888840000000000\". So row 5 in input, the leftmost and rightmost digits got changed: originally row 5 first digit '0' changed to '4'? Actually check: in input row 5, the string begins with \"08888888888888888800000000000\". The output row 5 begins \"48888888888888888840000000000\". So the first digit changed from 0 to 4, and the last digit changed from 0 to 4? Let's check carefully: \nRow 5 Input: \"0 8 888888888888888 000000000000\". Actually let's count columns: It's 30 columns? Actually count the digits: The provided string \"08888888888888888800000000000\" seems 30 digits. The output \"48888888888888888840000000000\" is also 30 digits.\nMapping: The segment \"088888888888888888\" becomes \"488888888888888888\" and then \"000000000000\" becomes \"400000000000\"? Wait let's try to align them: \nWe have input row 5: \"08888888888888888800000000000\". \nI want to check the change: In the output row 5, the first digit is '4' instead of '0', and the last digit is '4' also. And in the middle parts, digits remain the same.\nRow 6: input \"08888888888888888800000000000\", output \"48888888888888888844000000000\". So the last 12 digits: originally \"000000000000\", now \"440000000000\" i.e. the right part digits: second last digit becomes '4'? Let's check: input row 6: \"08888888888888888800000000000\" becomes \"48888888888888888844000000000\". So the leftmost digit changed and the penultimate two digits changed? Actually pattern: row 5: changed first and last digit, row 6: changed first digit and then a pair at the right end? Actually let's re-read:\nRow 5: Output \"48888888888888888840000000000\". So the digits that changed: the first digit becomes 4 (where originally it was 0) and the last digit becomes 4 (where originally it was 0). \nRow 6: Output \"48888888888888888844000000000\". So first digit becomes 4, and then the two digits at the right end become \"44\" instead of \"00\"? \nRow 7: Input \"08888888888888888800000000000\" becomes \"48888888888888888844400000000\". So now three digits at the right become 444 instead of \"000\". \nRow 8: becomes \"48888888888888888844400000000\", same.\nRow 9: becomes \"48888888888888888844000000000\", so back to two digits at right become 44.\nRow 10: becomes \"48888888888888888840000000000\", so back to one digit at right becomes 4.\nRow 11: becomes \"08888888888888888800000000000\", i.e. then revert back to original row 11.\n\nSo pattern in Example 1: It looks like the grid is symmetric vertically, and the transformation is to add a \"4\" to the border of the filled region? Wait, note: The region of interest is the contiguous region of 8's. The grid is mostly 0's except there's a large block of 8's in the middle. In input, rows 1-4 and rows 12-16 have border of 0's, and the 8's fill an annulus? Let's check: In the input, there is a diamond of 8's? Actually, let's try to see pattern: The input grid dimensions: 26 rows, 30 columns. The \"8\" region: It is like a diamond? The first row has 4 0's then 24 digits? Actually, wait, let's try a different approach: It might be a rule that adds a \"4\" pattern along the border of a connected region of 8's. Specifically, the transformation might be: for every cell that is adjacent (possibly diagonally?) to an 8, if it is 0, then change it to 4? But then we see the transformation of row 5: originally row 5 had a", "prompt_tokens": 1491, "completion_tokens": 2048}

There are multiple examples \"E.g. 1\", \"E.g. 2\", \"E.g. 3\", \"E.g. 4\", and the test input. For every example, the transformation rule is hidden. I must analyze the provided input and output examples, then deduce the transformation rule that transforms input grid to output grid.\n\nWe are given grids with many digits. They are not separated by spaces? They are just strings? But they are represented as lines. They are \"grid\" with rows, each row is a string of digits. And output is similar.\n\nI see that the given examples are long strings of digits, but they are representing matrices of digits? They might be 9x9 grids? Actually let me count columns. Let's examine \"E.g. 1 Input\" lines: They are lines of digits. Count length of each row.\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nLine 1: \"673717221765575775755671227173\" Count the digits: 24 digits?

I'll count manually: \n\"673717221765575775755671227173\"\nI can count: \n6 7 3 7 1 7 2 2 1 7 6 5 5 7 7 7 5 5 5 6 7 1 2 2 7 1 7 3. Counting digits: 1:6,2:7,3:3,4:7,5:1,6:7,7:2,8:2,9:1,10:7,11:6,12:5,13:5,14:7,15:7,16:7,17:5,18:5,19:5,20:6,21:7,22:1,23:2,24:2,25:7,26:1,27:7,28:3. Wait I'm off. Let me recalc: \"673717221765575775755671227173\". I'll check grouping: \"67 37 17 22 17 65 575775755671227173\" That doesn't help.\n\nWait maybe it's not a matrix transformation? Wait, but the problem is \"Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)\" style. The examples here are usually grid transformations with shapes. But these digits might represent colors? Possibly \"0\" and \"1\" binary images. But here we have digits beyond 0 and 1. Alternatively, they might be \"puzzle grids\" that are \"pattern transformations\".\n\nLet's check differences between input and output in each example.\n\nI think the transformation might be: \"Reflect rows around the vertical center\", \"swap colors\", \"rotate\", \"shift digits\", etc. Let's examine first example differences:\n\nE.g. 1: There are many lines. Let's check row 1 of E.g. 1 Input vs Output:\n\nE.g. 1 Input row1: \"673717221765575775755671227173\"\nE.g. 1 Output row1: \"673717221765575775755671227173\"\nThey are identical row 1. So row 1 did not change.\n\nRow 2 input: \"769977557651777777771567557799\"\nOutput row2: \"769977557651777777771567557799\"\nSame row.\n\nRow 3 input: \"399725276576579999756756725279\"\nOutput row3: \"399725276576579999756756725279\"\nSame row.\n\nRow4 input: \"797925775166779449776615775297\"\nOutput row4: \"797925775166779449776615775297\"\nSame row.\n\nRow5 input: \"172299965757339999337575699922\"\nOutput row5: \"172299965757339999337575699922\" same.\n\nRow6 input: \"700000057777369669637777596955\"\nOutput row6: \"775596957777369669637777596955\"\nDifference: row6 changed from \"700000057777369669637777596955\" to \"775596957777369669637777596955\". Let's compare digit by digit. Row6:\nInput: 700000057777369669637777596955\nOutput: 775596957777369669637777596955\n\nSo the first 6 digits: input \"700000\", output \"775596\". The digits from position 7 onward maybe are same? Let's check: \"700000057777369669637777596955\". The transformation changed first 6 digits maybe to \"775596\" from \"700000\". The rest digits maybe remain same? Let's check: Input row6: digits: \nPositions: 1-6: \"700000\", then 7: \"0\", then \"5777736969637777596955\"? Let's check carefully:\nInput row6: \"700000057777369669637777596955\"\nI want to align with output row6: \"775596957777369669637777596955\". They differ exactly in the first 6 digits? Let's check: \n- Output row6 first 6 digits: \"775596\". Input: \"700000\". So the transformation might be: In some rows, the first six digits are replaced with new ones taken from somewhere else. But then row7 input: \"200000095799993663999975999972\"\nOutput row7: \"252799995799993663999975999972\"\nDifference: input: \"200000095799993663999975999972\" becomes \"252799995799993663999975999972\". So first six digits: \"200000\" become \"252799\". And row8 input: \"200000077794966336694977795677\"\nOutput row8: \"257765977794966336694977795677\". The difference: input \"200000077794966336694977795677\", output \"257765977794966336694977795677\". So first 6 digits \"200000\" become \"257765\". Row9 input: \"100000072625773773775262757556\"\nOutput row9: \"176557572625773773775262757556\". So first 6 digits \"100000\" become \"176557\".\n\nLet's check row10 input: \"700000076624737777374266777715\"\nOutput row10: \"765177776624737777374266777715\". So first 6 digits: \"700000\" become \"765177\". Row11 input: \"600000092262376776732622997567\"\nOutput row11: \"657657992262376776732622997567\". So first 6 digits: \"600000\" become \"657657\". Row12 input: \"500000045425777667775245497766\"\nOutput row12: \"516677945425777667775245497766\". So first 6 digits: \"500000\" become \"516677\". Row13 input: \"575733997737252112527370000375\"\nOutput row13: \"575733997737252112527377993375\". So first 6 digits: \"575733\" remain same? Actually \"575733\" vs \"575733\", same? Wait, check: \"575733\" input row13 vs output row13: Actually row13 input: \"575733997737252112527370000375\". Output row13: \"575733997737252112527377993375\". The first 6 digits \"575733\" are same, then differences at positions 7 maybe? Let's check row14 input: \"777736967377551111557730000377\"\nOutput row14: \"777736967377551111557737696377\". Compare first 6 digits: \"777736\" vs \"777736\", same, then differences later.\n\nIt seems the transformation is not uniform across rows. It appears that sometimes the first 6 digits change, sometimes the last 6 digits change. Let's compare later rows: row15: input: \"579999363767212552127670000999\", output: \"579999363767212552127673639999\". Change? Compare: input row15: \"579999363767212552127670000999\", output: \"579999363767212552127673639999\". It appears that the substring \"670000\" becomes \"673639\". Actually, let me check: row15 input: digits: \"579999363767212552127670000999\"\nBreak into parts: maybe the grid is 28 columns? Let's check: row15 output: \"579999363767212552127673639999\". They are almost identical except the segment \"670000\" in input vs \"673639\" in output. But wait, row15 input: \"579999363767212552127670000999\" \nMaybe it's 28 digits? Let's count: 28 digits? Actually, let's count row1 digits: \"673717221765575775755671227173\" length? Let me count: I'll count manually: \nRow1: \"67 37 17 22 17 65 57 57 75 75 56 71 22 71 73\". Count groups: Actually easier: count digits manually by grouping in twos maybe.\n\nI suspect the grid is 28 columns? Let's count row1: I'll count: \n\"6\" (1), \"", "prompt_tokens": 3405, "completion_tokens": 2048}

We have four examples. The task is to deduce the rule from examples and apply it to a test input grid. The examples are labeled E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, E.g. 4, each with an input grid and output grid transformation. We must analyze what transformation is applied. We have to produce final test output grid in JSON list-of-lists format, and also produce reasoning within <thinking> (of at most 5 steps) and then final output in <answer>.\n\nLet's restate examples and try to find pattern:\n\nWe are given 4 examples. Let's re-read examples with details:\n\nE.g. 1:\nInput grid (12 rows, 12 columns? Actually check: They are strings of length 12 digits? Let's count: The e.g. 1 input: There are lines:\n\n1) \"000000000000\"\n2) \"000000000000\"\n3) \"000000000000\"\n4) \"000000000002\"\n5) \"000000000000\"\n6) \"000000000000\"\n7) \"000000000000\"\n8) \"000000000000\"\n9) \"000000000000\"\n10) \"000000000000\"\n11) \"010000000000\"\n12) \"000000000000\"\n13) \"000000000000\"\n\nWait, count lines: Actually they are block but then output is 13 rows, not 12. Let me check:\n\nE.g. 1 Input lines:\nLine1: 000000000000 (12 columns)\nLine2: 000000000000\nLine3: 000000000000\nLine4: 000000000002\nLine5: 000000000000\nLine6: 000000000000\nLine7: 000000000000\nLine8: 000000000000\nLine9: 000000000000\nLine10:000000000000\nLine11:010000000000\nLine12:000000000000\nLine13:000000000000\n\nThat is indeed 13 rows. And output lines: Actually e.g. 1 Output lines:\n\nLine1: 000000000000\nLine2: 000000000000\nLine3: 000000000000\nLine4: 000000000002\nLine5: 000000033330\nLine6: 000000300000\nLine7: 000003000000\nLine8: 000030000000\nLine9: 000300000000\nLine10:003000000000\nLine11:010000000000\nLine12:000000000000\nLine13:000000000000\n\nSo both input and output grids are the same dimension: 13 rows and 12 columns. So I guess the transformation rule is applied row-wise? Wait, let's check differences:\n\nObserving E.g. 1:\nThe non-trivial transformation is visible in row 4 in input: \"000000000002\" becomes row 4 in output: same \"000000000002\" (unchanged) except further rows show a pattern \"033330\", \"300000\", \"003000000\", etc. Wait, look at output row 5 is \"000000033330\". So row 5 got extra numbers. Also row 6: \"000000300000\", row 7: \"000003000000\", row 8: \"000030000000\", row 9: \"000300000000\", row 10: \"003000000000\". And row 11 remains \"010000000000\". interesting.\n\nLook at E.g. 2:\nE.g. 2 Input lines:\nLine1: \"000000000000\"\nLine2: \"020000000000\"\nLine3: \"000000000000\"\nLine4: \"000000000000\"\nLine5: \"000000000000\"\nLine6: \"000000000000\"\nLine7: \"000000000000\"\nLine8: \"000000000000\"\nLine9: \"000000000000\"\nLine10:\"000000000000\"\nLine11:\"000000000000\"\nLine12:\"000000000000\"\nLine13:\"000000000000\"\nLine14:\"000000001000\"\nLine15:\"000000000000\"\n\nOutput lines for E.g. 2:\nLine1: \"000000000000\"\nLine2: \"020000000000\"\nLine3: \"003000000000\"\nLine4: \"003000000000\"\nLine5: \"003000000000\"\nLine6: \"003000000000\"\nLine7: \"003000000000\"\nLine8: \"003000000000\"\nLine9: \"000300000000\"\nLine10:\"000030000000\"\nLine11:\"000003000000\"\nLine12:\"000000300000\"\nLine13:\"000000030000\"\nLine14:\"000000001000\"\nLine15:\"000000000000\"\n\nObserving differences: In input, row 2 had \"020000000000\". In output, row 2 remains same? Actually row 2 in output is \"020000000000\". Then rows 3 to 8 become \"003000000000\", then row 9: \"000300000000\", row 10: \"000030000000\", row 11: \"000003000000\", row 12: \"000000300000\", row 13: \"000000030000\", then row 14: \"000000001000\", row 15: \"000000000000\". So pattern is similar to E.g. 1: a series of rows get a \"3\" pattern that seems to be a diagonal of some sort.\n\nNow E.g. 3:\nInput:\nLine1: \"0000000000000000\" (16 columns)\nLine2: \"0000002000000000\"\nLine3: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine4: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine5: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine6: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine7: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine8: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine9: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine10:\"0000000000000000\"\nLine11:\"0000000000000000\"\nLine12:\"0000000000000000\"\nLine13:\"0001000000000000\"\nLine14:\"0000000000000000\"\nLine15:\"0000000000000000\"\n\nOutput:\nLine1: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine2: \"0000002000000000\"\nLine3: \"0000030000000000\"\nLine4: \"0000030000000000\"\nLine5: \"0000030000000000\"\nLine6: \"0000030000000000\"\nLine7: \"0000030000000000\"\nLine8: \"0000030000000000\"\nLine9: \"0000030000000000\"\nLine10:\"0000030000000000\"\nLine11:\"0000030000000000\"\nLine12:\"0000300000000000\"\nLine13:\"0001000000000000\"\nLine14:\"0000000000000000\"\nLine15:\"0000000000000000\"\n\nSo pattern: Row2 remains with the \"200000000000\" part? Actually row2 input \"0000002000000000\" remains unchanged? Actually check row2: Input row2: \"0000002000000000\", Output row2: \"0000002000000000\"? Actually output row2 is \"0000002000000000\", yes it's unchanged. Then rows 3-11 become \"0000030000000000\" except row12 becomes \"0000300000000000\" and then row13 remains unchanged? Actually row13 is \"0001000000000000\" in input and remains same in output? But in output, row13 is also \"0001000000000000\". Wait, check: E.g. 3 output:\nRow1: unchanged\nRow2: \"0000002000000000\" (unchanged)\nRow3: \"0000030000000000\"\nRow4: \"0000030000000000\"\nRow5: \"0000030000000000\"\nRow6: \"0000030000000000\"\nRow7: \"0000030000000000\"\nRow8: \"0000030000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000030000000000\"\nRow10:\"0000030000000000\"\nRow11:\"0000030000000000\"\nRow12:\"0000300000000000\"\nRow13:\"0001000000000000\"\nRow14:\"0000000000000000\"\nRow15:\"0000000000000000\"\n\nSo pattern: There's a region containing a \"3\" which appears in a diagonal pattern. Also in E.g. 4:\nInput:\nLine1: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine2: \"0000000000010000\"\nLine3: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine4: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine5: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine6: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine7: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine8: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine9: \"0000000000000000\"\nLine10:\"0000000000000000\"\nLine11:\"0000000000000000\"\nLine12:\"0000000000000000\"\nLine13:\"0000000000000000\"\nLine14:\"0002000000000000\"\nLine15:\"0000000000000000\"\nLine16:\"000000000", "prompt_tokens": 1261, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The transformation rule: apparently, this is similar to \"painting\" one pattern inside a boundary of a grid. Let me analyze structure.\n\nWe have E.g. 1 input:\nRow0: \"3000000000\"\nRow1: \"0200000000\"\nRow2: \"0011111100\"\nRow3: \"0010000100\"\nRow4: \"0010000100\"\nRow5: \"0010000100\"\nRow6: \"0010000100\"\nRow7: \"0011111100\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nOutput for E.g. 1:\nRow0: \"3000000000\"\nRow1: \"0200000000\"\nRow2: \"0011111100\"\nRow3: \"0013333100\"\nRow4: \"0013223100\"\nRow5: \"0013223100\"\nRow6: \"0013333100\"\nRow7: \"0011111100\"\nRow8: \"0000000000\"\nRow9: \"0000000000\"\n\nObservations: In E.g. 1, the input grid has a border with numbers along top and left edges? Let\u2019s analyze:\n\n- The first two rows remain unchanged: \"3000000000\", \"0200000000\". The rest are inside. The interesting region is rows 2 to 7. The left column in these rows are '0'? Actually, row2: \"0011111100\", row3: \"0010000100\", etc.\n- The transformation: It appears that the numbers inside the \"box\" (the region with boundary \"1\" maybe?) are replaced with new numbers that are computed somehow. The output shows: row2 remains unchanged \"0011111100\". Then row3 becomes \"0013333100\", row4 becomes \"0013223100\", row5 becomes \"0013223100\", row6 becomes \"0013333100\", then row7 remains unchanged \"0011111100\".\n\nSo only rows 3-6 changed. The left column of these rows is still \"0\", and the right column \"0\" as well. The pattern \"111111\" becomes \"111111\" in row2 and row7. But inside, something was computed. Look at row3: \"0010000100\" becomes \"0013333100\". So in row3, originally the digits were: \"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\". After transformation: \"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"3\", \"3\", \"3\", \"3\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\". Similarly row4: \"0010000100\" becomes \"0013223100\". So the middle region changed. In row3, the block from index 3 to index 6 turned from \"0000\" to \"3333\". In row4, the block turned from \"0000\" to \"3223\" maybe? Let's re-read row4: \"0010000100\" vs \"0013223100\". Actually, let's break down column indices: columns 0-9. In row3: columns: 0:0, 1:0, 2:1, 3:0, 4:0, 5:0, 6:0, 7:1, 8:0, 9:0.\nMapping to output row3: 0, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0.\nSo transformation on the inner block region from col3 to col6. Row4: input: 0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0 becomes output: 0,0,1,3,2,2,3,1,0,0. Row5: same as input becomes same as row4 output: 0,0,1,3,2,2,3,1,0,0? Actually row5 output: \"0013223100\", same as row4.\nRow6: input: same as row3 becomes \"0013333100\", which is same as row3 output.\n\nSo pattern: The inner area which is the \"box\" is replaced with a pattern \"3333\" at top and bottom rows of the inner box, and \"3223\" for the middle rows? Wait, let's check: row3 and row6 got same pattern \"3333\" in the inner block, row4 and row5 got \"3223\" pattern. But look at the border of the inner region: The inner region is defined by the outer boundary of \"1\"s: Actually, row2 and row7 are boundaries of the inner region, with digits \"111111\". The inner region appears to be a rectangle with corners at (2,2) to (7,7) (if we consider indices: row2, columns 2 to 7 are \"111111\" maybe? Actually row2: digits columns: index2 is '1'? Let's see: row2: \"0011111100\" means columns 2-7 are '111111'? Because row2: \"00\" then \"111111\" then \"00\". Similarly row7: \"0011111100\". So inner region boundaries are row2 and row7. Then the transformation applied on the inner region (excluding the boundary) becomes: We have a 5x5 region (rows 3,4,5,6 and columns 3,4,5,6?) Actually check: The inner region is defined by the \"1\" boundary, but the digits inside the boundary are originally zeros? Let's re-read the input:\nRow2: \"0011111100\" => so the region from columns 2 to 7 is \"111111\". Row3: \"0010000100\" => columns 2 is '1' then columns 3 to 6 are zeros, then column7 is '1'? Actually, looking carefully: row3 \"0010000100\":\nIndex0:0, index1:0, index2:1, index3:0, index4:0, index5:0, index6:0, index7:1, index8:0, index9:0.\nRow4: \"0010000100\" same pattern.\nRow5: \"0010000100\"\nRow6: \"0010000100\"\nRow7: \"0011111100\".\n\nSo the inner region is a 6x6 rectangle? Actually, the boundary digits are \"1\" at row2, row7, and at col2 and col7 in rows 3-6. The region inside (excluding the boundary) are rows 3-6 and columns 3-6, which is 4x4. And in the output, these inner regions get replaced with numbers: row3, columns3-6 become 3333, row4, columns3-6 become 3223, row5, columns3-6 become 3223, row6, columns3-6 become 3333.\n\nSo what is the transformation rule? It might be: Given a grid with a boundary drawn (the \"1\" values) that enclose a region, fill the enclosed region with numbers that are computed via some pattern. The pattern: top row of inner region gets all same number, bottom row gets all same number, and the middle rows get a pattern where the left two and right two digits are different from the middle two digits. Specifically, in example 1, the top border of the inner region is row2, which remains \"111111\" in the output, and the inner region's top row is row3 becomes \"3333\", and bottom row (row6) becomes \"3333\", and the middle rows (row4 and row5) become \"3223\". But wait, check row3: \"3333\", row4: \"3223\", row5: \"3223\", row6: \"3333\". So it seems the pattern is a diamond-like structure maybe? But then look at example 2.\n\nE.g. 2 Input:\nRow0: \"200000000000000\" (length 15)\nRow1: \"060000000000000\"\nRow2: \"004000000000000\"\nRow3: \"000111111111000\"\nRow4: \"000100000001000\"\nRow5: \"000100000001000\"\nRow6: \"000100000001000\"\nRow7: \"000100000001000\"\nRow8: \"000100000001000\"\nRow9: \"000100000001000\"\nRow10:\"000100000001000\"\nRow11:\"000111111111000\"\nRow12:\"000000000000000\"\nRow13:\"000000000000000\"\nRow14:\"000000000000000\"\n\nOutput for E.g. 2:\nRow0: \"200000000000000\"\nRow1: \"060000000000000\"\nRow2: \"004000000000000\"\nRow3: \"000111111111000\"\nRow4: \"000122222221000\"\nRow5: \"000126666621000\"\nRow6: \"000126444621000\"\nRow7: \"000126444621000\"\nRow8: \"000126444621000\"\nRow9: \"000126666621000\"\nRow10:\"000122222221", "prompt_tokens": 1041, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The output grid is extracted from specific cells.\n\nCheck e.g. 1: How do we get \"133\" from input? Let's check coordinates.\nThe output grid is only 3 rows by 3 columns (3x3). The output in e.g. 1 is:\nRow1: \"133\"\nRow2: \"122\"\nRow3: \"132\"\n\nMapping might be: It extracts digits from specific positions. Perhaps the transformation rule is \"take numbers from the input grid's cells that are nonzero\" but then output in a 3x3 grid? But then e.g. 1 input grid contains many numbers. Actually, let me analyze pattern:\n\nFor e.g. 1, we see nonzero digits at positions:\n- \"009990007440000\" row3.\n- \"008890007470000\" row4.\n- \"008890007440000\" row5.\n- \"000000001330000\" row7.\n- \"000000001220000\" row8.\n- \"000000001320000\" row9.\n- \"003660000000000\" row10.\n- \"003330000000000\" row11.\n- \"006630000000000\" row12.\n\nSo there are many numbers. But the output is 3 rows and 3 columns. Perhaps rule: extract only the outer ring of digits from a specific region? The outputs are \"133\", \"122\", \"132\". They are possibly extracted from a specific \"digit pattern\" shape in the input.\n\nMaybe it's about \"mirroring\" some values. Observing e.g. 1: The output digits: top row \"133\", middle row \"122\", bottom row \"132\". And in the input, we see three groups of digits: \"009990007440000\", \"008890007470000\", \"008890007440000\" and then later \"003660000000000\", \"003330000000000\", \"006630000000000\". Possibly the numbers have been rotated or something.\n\nWait, let me try to see if there is any pattern: In e.g. 1, the output \"133\" might be extracted from the bottom right block of the input? For e.g., look at row 12 \"006630000000000\" maybe the digits \"663\" but then output \"133\" is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is: Read the input grid in a spiral order and pick the first nonzero digits in a certain order? But then e.g. 1: if we spiral order the digits, what do we get?\n\nLet's try to analyze e.g. 1 closely:\n\nI have a 15x15 grid, but the only nonzero digits are in rows 3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12. They are arranged in two clusters: upper cluster (rows 3-5) and lower cluster (rows 7-12). The output is a 3x3 grid. Possibly the transformation is to take the \"border\" of the nonzero region? Perhaps the transformation is: \"Take the unique nonzero digits in the input grid and arrange them in a 3x3 pattern.\"\n\nWait, check e.g. 2: Input has digits in rows 3,4,5,7,8,10,11,12,13? Let's see e.g. 2:\nRow3: \"000555000000000\" -> digits \"555\"\nRow4: \"000688000000000\" -> digits \"688\"\nRow5: \"000655009990000\" -> digits \"655\" and \"999\"\nRow7: \"000000004490000\" -> digits \"4490\"? Actually row7: \"000000004490000\" digits: \"4490\", but then row8: \"000000004990000\" digits \"4990\". Row10: \"000000017100000\" digits \"171000\"? Wait, re-read e.g. 2 input:\n\nLine by line:\n1: 000000000000000\n2: 000000000000000\n3: 000555000000000  -> so, a group \"555\"\n4: 000688000000000  -> group \"688\"\n5: 000655009990000  -> group \"655\" then \"999\"\n6: 000000004490000  -> group \"4490\" but only a number? Actually \"004490\" should be read as digits \"4490\"? But then row7: \"000000004990000\" -> digits \"4990\"\n8: 000000000000000\n9: 000000000000000\n10: 000000017100000 -> digits \"171000\"? Actually, \"000000017100000\": that is \"171000\" but then row11: \"000322071700000\" digits \"322071700\"? Actually, row11: \"000322071700000\" has many digits: \"322071700\"\nRow12: \"000222077700000\" -> \"222077700\"\nRow13: \"000323000000000\" -> \"323000000\"\nRow14: \"000000000000000\"\nRow15: \"000000000000000\"\n\nBut the output is:\n\"555\"\n\"688\"\n\"655\"\n\nSo in e.g. 2, the output is just the first three rows of the input block that contains digits \"555\", \"688\", \"655\". In e.g. 1, the output is \"133\", \"122\", \"132\". And in e.g. 3, the output is \"162\", \"611\", \"261\". How do these relate to the input? For e.g. 3, input rows:\nRow2: \"007550000000000\" -> group \"755\"\nRow3: \"005750001620000\" -> group \"575\" and then \"1620\"? Actually \"005750001620000\" would be \"575\" then \"162\" maybe.\nRow4: \"005770006110000\" -> group \"577\" then \"061\" maybe.\nRow5: \"000000002610000\" -> \"261\"\nThen later rows: row8: \"008330000000000\" -> \"833\", row9: \"003380000000000\" -> \"338\", row10: \"008330009440000\" -> \"833009440\", row11: \"000000004940000\" -> \"4940\", row12: \"000000004490000\" -> \"4490\".\nOutput: \nRow1: \"162\"\nRow2: \"611\"\nRow3: \"261\"\n\nObservation: The output in e.g. 3 is \"162\", \"611\", \"261\". Compare with input row? There is \"162\" in row3 second group? Actually row3: \"005750001620000\" ends with \"162000\". So maybe the output row1 \"162\" corresponds to the last three digits of row3. Then row2 output \"611\" might correspond to the last three digits of row4 \"006110000\" but \"611\" is present in row4? Yes, row4: \"005770006110000\" ends with \"610000\", so \"611\"? Actually check: \"006110000\", the first three digits \"611\" appear. Then output row3 \"261\" equals row5 \"002610000\", which gives \"261\". That is a pattern: In e.g. 3, the output rows come from rows 3,4,5 of the input, specifically the last three digits of those rows? Let's check e.g. 1: Which rows? Possibly rows 10,11,12? Let's check e.g. 1:\nRows:\nRow10: \"003660000000000\" last three digits \"600\"? But output row1 is \"133\". That doesn't match.\nMaybe the output rows come from rows 3,4,5", "prompt_tokens": 799, "completion_tokens": 2048}

It appears that in the input row, there is a pattern \"0000000000000000000000\" appended after \"022200\". In output, that part is replaced with \"8880033300088800\".\n- In row 9 input: \"0020000000000000000000\"\n  Output row 9: \"0020000800003000008000\"\n  So, the middle \"00000000000000000000\" got replaced with \"8003000008000\"? Let's count digits carefully.\nRow length is 20 digits (counting zeros). Actually, wait: input row 8: \"0222000000000000000000\" is 20 digits? Count \"022200\" is 6 digits then \"00000000000000000000\" is 14 zeros? Actually, let's count: row length in E.g. 1 input: each row is 20 characters. Actually, check row 1: \"0020080030008000000000\" is 20 characters? Count: \"00\" (2) then \"200\" (3) then \"8003\" (4) then \"0000\" (8) then \"8000\" (12) then \"0000\" (16) then \"0000\" (20). Yes.\nRow 8: \"022200\" is 6 digits, then 14 zeros. Output row 8: \"0222008880033300088800\" is 6 + 14 = 20 digits. So transformation seems to replace the middle part (which is the region after the initial pattern \"022200\" or \"002000\") with a pattern that has three blocks of digits: For row 8, the transformation is \"8880033300088800\" which is 14 digits. Let's break that into three segments: \"88800\", \"33300\", \"088800\". Wait, count: \"8880033300088800\" - maybe we can break it as \"88800\", \"33300\", \"088800\"? But that is 5+5+7 digits equals 17, not 14. Let's recalc: \"0222008880033300088800\"\nSegment: \"022200\" then \"8880033300088800\". But our transformation clearly is not symmetric maybe. Let's count digits: \"8880033300088800\" length: count: 8 digits? Let's count manually: '8' '8' '8' '0' '0' '3' '3' '3' '0' '0' '0' '8' '8' '8' '0' '0'? Actually, I'll count: \"8880033300088800\" is 16 digits? Let's recalc: The output row 8 is 20 digits. The first six digits \"022200\" remain unchanged from input row 8. The remaining 14 digits got replaced with \"8880033300088800\". So the transformation replaced the zeros in the second part with a pattern. Let's similarly examine row 9 and row 10.\n\nRow 9 input: \"0020000000000000000000\"\nOutput row 9: \"0020000800003000008000\"\nSo first 6 digits \"002000\" remain unchanged? Actually, check: \"002000\" is first 6 digits in row 9 input. In output, row 9 first 6 digits are \"002000\" as well. Then the next 14 digits are replaced by \"0800003000008000\".\n\nRow 10 input: \"0222000000000000000000\"\nOutput row 10: \"0222008880033300088800\"\nSo row 10 transformation is same as row 8 transformation? But input row 10 is same as row 8 \"022200\" then zeros; output row 10 same as row 8 output.\n\nSo the transformation in E.g. 1 only affects rows 8, 9, 10? And the transformation appears to be: For rows that have a pattern that starts with either \"022200\" or \"002000\" followed by 14 zeros, replace the zeros with a pattern that depends on the row: For \"022200\" rows, the replacement is \"8880033300088800\". For \"002000\" row, the replacement is \"0800003000008000\". How to deduce? Possibly the digits in the first part \"022200\" or \"002000\" represent some instructions for what to fill in the blanks? Look at row 1: \"0020080030008000000000\" remains unchanged. But row 1 is not affected, so maybe only rows with a pattern \"022200\" and \"002000\" are special. But row 1 is not special because it doesn't have that pattern. \nBut wait, row 1 is \"0020080030008000000000\", no. There is \"0020080030008000000000\". It has a pattern \"0020080030008\" which is not like the pattern seen in row 8 and row 9.\n\nMaybe the rule is: Identify the leftmost non-zero block in a row, then fill the rest of the row with a pattern that is determined by the digits of that block. In row 8, the left part is \"022200\", in row 9 it's \"002000\", in row 10 it's \"022200\" again. In row 8 and 10, the replacement is \"8880033300088800\", and in row 9, replacement is \"0800003000008000\". \nMaybe the rule is: The transformation takes the leftmost non-zero digits (which are like a key) and then generates a symmetric pattern in the remainder of the row, where the pattern digits are the complement of the key? For row 8, key \"022200\". Its complement? 9 - digit? Possibly each digit d replaced by 9-d? Let's test: For row 8 key \"022200\": digit by digit: 0->9, 2->7, 2->7, 2->7, 0->9, 0->9. That would yield \"077799\", but output is \"8880033300088800\", so no.\n\nMaybe the rule is: For rows that start with 6-digit block followed by 14 zeros, the output is the same 6-digit block, and then a pattern generated from the digits of that block? For row 8, block \"022200\" digits: 0,2,2,2,0,0. How to get \"888", "prompt_tokens": 1424, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The output grid always starts with \"000000\" at row1 and row8. The digits \"4444\", \"22220\", \"330\" appear in output. It seems digits in output are from 0,1,2,3,4,7 maybe.\n\nWait, let\u2019s examine structure:\n\nThe input rows are 8 rows, each with 20 columns? Actually check: \"04030200000000000000\" is 20 digits. The output rows are also 20 digits.\n\nObserving: The first 6 digits in input remain \"040302\". In output, those first 6 digits become \"000000\". So perhaps the rule is to replace all occurrences of 0,4,3,0,3,2 with something? Wait, let's check: \"040302\" becomes \"000000\"? Not necessarily, because the digits 0,4,3,0,3,2 become 0,0,0,0,0,0 respectively. So maybe the rule is to subtract 4 from 4, subtract 3 from 3, subtract 3 from 3, subtract 2 from 2? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet's check a more clear mapping: \"040302\" vs \"000000\". I noticed that in output, if digit 4 appears in input, sometimes it becomes digit 4? Actually, no, look at row2: \"04030200888800088880\" -> becomes \"00000000444400022220\". So the segment \"040302\" becomes \"000000\", then \"008888\" becomes \"004444\", then \"000888\" becomes \"000222\"? Let's break that: \"008888\" -> \"004444\" (8 becomes 4? Actually 8 becomes 4, yes). \"000888\" -> \"000222\" (8 becomes 2, right? But then \"00088880\" -> \"22220\" at the end? Let's re-read row2 of input: \"04030200888800088880\". Split maybe into segments: \"040302\" (first 6 digits) then \"008888\" (next 6 digits?) actually 6+6? Actually 6+6=12, then \"000888\" (6 digits) then \"80\" (2 digits) doesn't add up. Let's re-read carefully row2: It has 20 digits. Count: Characters: positions:\n1:0,2:4,3:0,4:3,5:0,6:2, 7:0,8:0,9:8,10:8,11:8,12:8, 13:0,14:0,15:0,16:8,17:8,18:8,19:8,20:0. So segments: \"040302\" positions 1-6, then \"008888\" positions 7-12, then \"000888\" positions 13-18, then \"80\" positions 19-20.\nMapping: \"040302\" becomes \"000000\" in output. \"008888\" becomes \"004444\" in output. \"000888\" becomes \"000222\" in output. and then \"80\" becomes \"20\"? Check: \"80\" becomes \"20\"? Let's check row2 output: \"00000000444400022220\". It is 20 digits. Let's break output row2: \"000000\" (positions 1-6) then \"004444\" (positions 7-12) then \"000222\" (positions 13-18) then \"20\" (positions 19-20). So transformation: \"008888\" -> \"004444\": That means each 8 becomes 4. \"000888\" -> \"000222\": That means each 8 becomes 2, but wait, then \"80\" becomes \"20\". So mapping for digit 8 in different segments? Possibly the transformation is not uniform across grid? Maybe it is based on the central region of the grid, where numbers indicate something like \"brightness\" or \"distance\" from border? The original ARC puzzles often have rules like \"fill the gap\" or \"cross out everything except a plus shape\" etc.\n\nI recall one ARC task: \"Fill a grid with numbers that represent distance from border\" perhaps? Alternatively, maybe the transformation is like \"erase the border\" or \"add a border\" or \"rotate digits\"? Let's check E.g. 2 to see if it's similar.\n\nE.g. 2:\n\nInput grid:\nLine1: \"010607088800888\"\nLine2: \"010607088800888\"\nLine3: \"010607000088888\"\nLine4: \"010607000088000\"\nLine5: \"010607000088000\"\nLine6: \"010607000088000\"\n\nOutput grid:\nLine1: \"000000011100777\"\nLine2: \"000000011100777\"\nLine3: \"000000000066777\"\nLine4: \"000000000066000\"\nLine5: \"000000000066000\"\nLine6: \"000000000066000\"\n\nObserving row1: \"010607088800888\" becomes \"000000011100777\". Compare digits:\nInput row1: 0,1,0,6,0,7,0,8,8,8,0,0,8,8,8.\nOutput row1: 0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,7,7,7.\nMapping: It seems that the left part \"0106070888\" becomes \"0000000111\" possibly, and then \"00888\" becomes \"000777\"? Let's analyze piece by piece. Maybe the transformation is \"mirror\" or \"rotate\"? But then E.g. 3 similarly.\n\nLet's re-read E.g. 3:\n\nInput grid:\nRow1: \"030204070880008800\"\nRow2: \"030204070888808800\"\nRow3: \"030204070008808800\"\nRow4: \"030204070008808888\"\nRow5: \"030204070000008888\"\nRow6: \"030204070000000088\"\nRow7: \"030204070000000000\"\n\nOutput grid:\nRow1: \"000000000330004400\"\nRow2: \"000000000332204400\"\nRow3: \"000000000002204400\"\nRow4: \"000000000002204477\"\nRow5: \"000000000000004477\"\nRow6: \"000000000000000077\"\nRow7: \"000000000000000000\"\n\nObserving structure: The input rows start with \"030204070\", and output rows start with \"000000000\". The pattern might be: The left part \"03020407\" becomes \"00000000\" and then the digit \"0\" remains \"0\"? Let's see: In row1, input: \"030204070880008800\". Output: \"000000000330004400\". The difference: \"03020407\" became \"00000000\" and then \"0888008800\" became \"330004400\"?\n\nWait, let's break row1 input: \"030204070880008800\". Count digits: 18 digits? Actually, let's count: It appears 18 digits. Output row1: \"000000000330004400\" also 18 digits. So segmentation: first 8 digits become \"00000000\", then \"0888008800\" becomes \"330004400\". In row2 input: \"030204070888808800\". Output row2: \"000000000332204400\". So the segment \"070888808800\" becomes \"000332204400\"? Wait, recalc: row2 input: \"03020407\" then \"0888088800\"? Let's recalc carefully. Row1: \"030204070880008800\". It might be segmented as: first 8 digits \"03020407\" then \"0880008800\"? But maybe segmentation: The first 8 digits are always", "prompt_tokens": 796, "completion_tokens": 2048}

The examples show transformation rules that are applied to input grids and yield output grids. Our job: \"deduce the rule from the examples and apply it to the final test input grid.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the provided examples:\n\nI'll label each example with numbering: E.g. 1, E.g. 2, E.g. 3, E.g. 4, and then test input.\n\nLet's check E.g. 1 Input and output:\n\nE.g. 1 Input:\nLine by line:\n1. \"111111111111111\"\n2. \"111111111111111\"\n3. \"111221111111111\"\n4. \"111221111111111\"\n5. \"111111111111111\"\n6. \"111111122211111\"\n7. \"111111122211111\"\n8. \"111111111111111\"\n9. \"111111111111111\"\n10. \"888888888888888\"\n11. \"882888888888888\"\n12. \"888888822288888\"\n13. \"888888822288888\"\n14. \"888888888888888\"\n15. \"888888888888888\"\n\nE.g. 1 Output:\nLine by line:\n1. \"111111111111111\"\n2. \"111111111111111\"\n3. \"111111111111122\"\n4. \"111111111111122\"\n5. \"111111111111111\"\n6. \"111111111111222\"\n7. \"111111111111222\"\n8. \"111111111111111\"\n9. \"111111111111111\"\n10. \"888888888888888\"\n11. \"288888888888888\"\n12. \"222888888888888\"\n13. \"222888888888888\"\n14. \"888888888888888\"\n15. \"888888888888888\"\n\nObserving differences, we see that for the region with digits \"1\" and \"2\" and \"2\"? Actually let's check: In E.g. 1, we see that in the top part, input lines 3 and 4: they are \"111221111111111\" and \"111221111111111\". In output, these lines become \"111111111111122\". So what happened? There was a \"221\" in the middle replaced with \"111122\"? Wait, let's check carefully.\n\nLet's compare line 3: Input: \"111221111111111\". Output: \"111111111111122\". So the input had a substring \"221\" in the middle? Actually let's find the difference: input: \"111221111111111\", output: \"111111111111122\". They differ in the positions around the middle?\nWait, let me index columns from 1 to 15.\n\nInput line 3: digits: positions: 1-3: \"111\", then 4-6: \"221\", then 7-15: \"1111111\". Output line 3: positions 1-6: \"111111\", then positions 7-9: \"111\", then positions 10-12: \"122\"? Actually wait, let me re-read: The output line 3 is \"111111111111122\". It might be easier to compare substring positions.\n\nMaybe we need to see pattern: Possibly the transformation rule involves reversing segments maybe? Let's try to compare E.g.1 lines 3 and 4:\n\nInput line 3: \"111221111111111\"\nOutput line 3: \"111111111111122\"\nInput line 4: \"111221111111111\"\nOutput line 4: \"111111111111122\"\n\nSo the differences: The \"221\" in the input becomes \"111122\" in the output? Actually, wait, let's check carefully: The output has 15 digits. The input has \"111221111111111\". If you remove the middle \"221\", then you get \"111\" + \"1111111\" = \"1111111111\"? That doesn't match. Let's re-read the grid carefully:\n\nIt appears the grid is 15 columns wide? Counting: \"111111111111111\" is 15 digits of \"1\". So indeed, each line is 15 digits long.\n\nLine 3 input: \"111221111111111\"\nLine 3 output: \"111111111111122\"\n\nComparing digits column by column:\n- In input, positions 1-3: \"111\", positions 4-6: \"221\", positions 7-15: \"1111111\" (that's 9 digits) but wait, 15 total digits, so if we remove 6 digits then remaining is 9 digits, not 9? Let's recalc: 15-6=9. Yes.\n- In output, positions 1-6: \"111111\", positions 7-9: \"111\", positions 10-12: \"122\"? That would sum to 6+3+3 = 12 digits, not 15. I must recount carefully.\n\nLet me count properly:\nLine 3 input: \"111221111111111\". Let's count digits: \n\"111\" (3 digits), then \"221\" (3 digits), then \"111111111\" is 9 digits, total 15. So positions: 1-3: \"111\", 4-6: \"221\", 7-15: \"111111111\". \nLine 3 output: \"111111111111122\". Count digits: \n\"111111\" (6 digits) then \"111111\" (6 digits) then \"122\" (3 digits) sums to 15. So positions: 1-6: \"111111\", 7-12: \"111111\", 13-15: \"122\". \n\nThus transformation: It seems the middle block \"221\" in input got split into two groups: one group becomes the rightmost group in output? Actually, what is the relation? \nMaybe the rule is that the pattern \"1122\" gets replaced with \"111122\"? But not exactly.\n\nLet's compare line 6 input: \"111111122211111\" vs line 6 output: \"111111111111222\".\nLine 6 input: positions: \"111111\" (first 6 digits), then \"122211\" (6 digits), then \"111\" (3 digits)? But wait, 6+6+? Actually, let's recalc: 15 digits in total. Let's segment: maybe it's always a 6-6-3 segmentation.\nFor line 6 input: if we split into three segments of 6, 6, 3 digits, then:\nSegment1: digits 1-6: \"111111\"\nSegment2: digits 7-12: \"122211\"\nSegment3: digit 13-15: \"111\"\nOutput line 6: \"111111111111222\" can be segmented as 6,6,3 also: Segment1: \"111111\", Segment2: \"111111\", Segment3: \"222\". \nSo comparing segment2 and segment3:\nInput segment2 was \"122211\", output segment2 is \"111111\", and input segment3 \"111\" becomes output segment3 \"222\". It seems like a swap and inversion maybe: The second segment's digits are replaced by ones? And the third segment's digits are replaced by twos? But let's check line 3: For line 3, segments: if we split into three segments of 6,6,3:\nSegment1: \"111221\" (first 6 digits of input line 3: but wait, check input line 3: \"111221111111111\", if we split into three segments of 6 digits each, then segment1 = digits1-6: \"111221\", segment2 = digits7-12: \"111111\", segment3 = digits13-15: \"111\". But then output line 3, if split similarly: segment1: \"111111\", segment2: \"111111\", segment3: \"122\". That doesn't match. Instead, maybe the segmentation is not constant.\n\nLet's try to see pattern: Compare line 3 input and output: They differ in the middle three digits maybe? Input line 3: \"111221111111111\". Output line 3: \"111111111111122\". The difference is that the \"221\" in the middle (positions 4-6) in input becomes \"111\" in the first part and \"122\" in the end? Wait, maybe the transformation is: In each row, count the number of 1's and 2's, and then output a row where the left part is a sequence of 1's equal in length to the count of 1's in the entire row, then a sequence of 1's equal to the count of some other? Not sure.\n\nLet's check E.g. 1, row 10: Input row 10: \"888888888888888\". Output row 10: \"888888888888888\". So row 10 remains the same. Rows with 1's seem to be transformed while rows with 8's are transformed differently maybe.\n\nLook at rows 11 in E.g. 1: Input row 11: \"882888888888888\". Output row 11: \"288888888888888\". So the first digit changed from 8 to 2? And row 12: Input \"888888822288888\" becomes \"222888888888888\". Row 13: same input becomes \"222888888888888\". Row 14: remains same, row 15 remains same. So there is transformation on rows that contain", "prompt_tokens": 1061, "completion_tokens": 2048}
