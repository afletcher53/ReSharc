In all examples, the input is 3x3 and the output is 9x9. This suggests the output grid size is 3 times the input grid size in both dimensions (width * 3, height * 3).\n    *   Visually inspect the structure of the output grids. They appear to be composed of 3x3 blocks, arranged in a 3x3 super-grid structure.\n\n2.  **Identify the Pattern/Rule:**\n    *   Let the input grid be `I` and the output grid be `O`. Let the size of `I` be `N x N` (here N=3). The output grid `O` is `(3N) x (3N)`.\n    *   Divide the output grid `O` into an `N x N` grid of blocks, where each block `Bij` is of size `N x N`. The position `(i, j)` of the block corresponds to the cell `I[i][j]` in the input grid.\n    *   Examine Example 1:\n        *   Input `I = [[0, 7, 7], [7, 7, 7], [0, 7, 7]]`\n        *   Output `O` (9x9). Let's look at the blocks:\n            *   `I[0][0] = 0` (black). The corresponding top-left 3x3 block in `O` is all black: `[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`. Let's call this the `ZeroBlock`.\n            *   `I[0][1] = 7` (red). The corresponding top-middle 3x3 block in `O` is `[[0,7,7],[7,7,7],[0,7,7]]`, which is identical to the input grid `I`. Let's call this the `InputBlock`.\n            *   `I[0][2] = 7` (red). The top-right block is `InputBlock`.\n            *   `I[1][0] = 7` (red). The middle-left block is `InputBlock`.\n            *   `I[1][1] = 7` (red). The center block is `InputBlock`.\n            *   `I[1][2] = 7` (red). The middle-right block is `InputBlock`.\n            *   `I[2][0] = 0` (black). The bottom-left block is `ZeroBlock`.\n            *   `I[2][1] = 7` (red). The bottom-middle block is `InputBlock`.\n            *   `I[2][2] = 7` (red). The bottom-right block is `InputBlock`.\n    *   Hypothesis: The output grid is constructed by replacing each cell `I[i][j]` of the input grid with an `N x N` block. If `I[i][j]` is the background color (0), the block is an `N x N` grid of 0s (`ZeroBlock`). If `I[i][j]` is any other color, the block is a copy of the original input grid `I` (`InputBlock`).\n\n3.  **Verify the Rule with Other Examples:**\n    *   Example 2: `I = [[4, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 0]]`. The output grid correctly places `InputBlock` where input has 4, and `ZeroBlock` where input has 0.\n    *   Example 3: `I = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2], [2, 0, 2]]`. The output grid correctly places `InputBlock` where input has 2, and `ZeroBlock` where input has 0.\n    *   Example 4: `I = [[6, 6, 0], [6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6]]`. The output grid correctly places `InputBlock` where input has 6, and `ZeroBlock` where input has 0.\n    *   Example 5: `I = [[2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2]]`. The output grid correctly places `InputBlock` where input has 2, and `ZeroBlock` where input has 0.\n    *   The hypothesis holds true for all examples. The background color is consistently 0.\n\n4.  **Apply the Rule to the Test Input:**\n    *   Test Input `I = [[7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 0]]`. The size N=3.\n    *   The output grid `O` will be 9x9.\n    *   Define `ZeroBlock = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`.\n    *   Define `InputBlock = [[7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 0]]`.\n    *   Determine the blocks for the output grid based on `I`:\n        *   `I[0][0] = 7` -> `B00 = InputBlock`\n        *   `I[0][1] = 0` -> `B01 = ZeroBlock`\n        *   `I[0][2] = 7` -> `B02 = InputBlock`\n        *   `I[1][0] = 7` -> `B10 = InputBlock`\n        *   `I[1][1] = 0` -> `B11 = ZeroBlock`\n        *   `I[1][2] = 7` -> `B12 = InputBlock`\n        *   `I[2][0] = 7` -> `B20 = InputBlock`\n        *   `I[2][1] = 7` -> `B21 = InputBlock`\n        *   `I[2][2] = 0` -> `B22 = ZeroBlock`\n    *   Assemble the output grid `O` by placing these blocks:\n        ```\n        Row 1: InputBlock | ZeroBlock | InputBlock\n        Row 2: InputBlock | ZeroBlock | InputBlock\n        Row 3: InputBlock | InputBlock | ZeroBlock\n        ```\n    *   Explicitly construct the 9x9 grid:\n        ```\n        707 000 707\n        707 000 707\n        770 000 770\n\n        707 000 707\n        707 000 707\n        770 000 770\n\n        707 707 000\n        707 707 000\n        770 770 000\n        ```\n\n5.  **Format the Output:**\n    *   Convert the constructed grid into the required JSON format.\n\n```json\n[\n  [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n  [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n  [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0],\n  [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n  [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n  [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0],\n  [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n  [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n  [7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nThe steps are clear and the application of the rule to the test case is straightforward.

Analyze Input/Output Examples:**\n\n*   **Colors:** Input grids use colors 0 (black) and 3 (green). Output grids use 0, 3, and 4 (red).\n*   **Transformation:** The output grid is largely the same as the input, but some cells (originally 0 or 3) are changed to color 4. The color 4 seems to fill certain areas or modify certain cells based on context.\n*   **Example 1:** Changes 3s at (2,2) and (3,3) to 4. These cells are surrounded cardinally by 3s.\n*   **Example 2:** Changes 3 at (4,6) to 4. This cell is also surrounded cardinally by 3s.\n*   **Example 3:** Changes several 0s and 3s to 4s. For instance, (3,4) (originally 0) changes to 4. (3,7) (originally 0) changes to 4. (3,8) (originally 3) stays 3. (4,7) (originally 3) stays 3. (4,4) (originally 0) changes to 4. This shows that both 0s and 3s can change, and the condition isn't simply being surrounded by 3s (e.g., (3,7) has 0s above, below, and right).\n*   **Filling Pattern:** The added 4s often appear in horizontal or vertical segments between existing 3s, suggesting a filling mechanism based on boundaries.\n\n**2. Formulate Hypotheses and Test:**\n\n*   **Hypothesis 1 (Failed):** Cells change based on a fixed neighborhood pattern (like 2x2 blocks or specific neighbor configurations). This failed because the conditions for change seemed inconsistent across examples (e.g., the neighbors of changed cell (3,7) in Ex 3 didn't fit patterns from Ex 1/2).\n*   **Hypothesis 2 (Failed):** Flood fill from the border to identify \"inside\" regions (0s unreachable from border 0s), then fill these. This failed because Example 1 had no enclosed 0s but still had changes, and Example 3 had cells changing to 4 that were reachable from the border via 0s (like (3,7)).\n*   **Hypothesis 3 (Promising -> Refined):** A cell (r, c) changes to 4 if it's \"bounded\" by 3s horizontally and vertically.\n    *   Initial Definition: Bounded means having a 3 to the Left, Right, Up, and Down (scanning outwards, ignoring cells until a non-zero is hit).\n    *   Testing Definition: Worked for Ex 1, Ex 2. Failed for Ex 3 (cell (3,7)=0 changed to 4 but had no 3 directly above when scanning).\n    *   Refined Definition (Rule Mod 1): A cell (r, c) changes to 4 if:\n        1.  Its value is 0 or 3.\n        2.  It is bounded horizontally: There's a 3 to the left (grid[r, c_L]=3 with only 0s between c_L and c) AND a 3 to the right (grid[r, c_R]=3 with only 0s between c and c_R).\n        3.  It is bounded vertically on at least one side: EITHER there's a 3 above (grid[r_U, c]=3 with only 0s between r_U and r) OR there's a 3 below (grid[r_D, c]=3 with only 0s between r and r_D).\n\n*   **Testing Refined Definition:**\n    *   Ex 1 (2,2)=3: L=3@ (2,1), R=3@ (2,3), U=3@ (1,2), D=3@ (3,2). Meets (1), (2), (3 - U or D). -> Changes to 4. Correct.\n    *   Ex 1 (3,3)=3: L=3@ (3,2), R=3@ (3,4), U=3@ (2,3), D=3@ (4,3). Meets (1), (2), (3). -> Changes to 4. Correct.\n    *   Ex 3 (3,4)=0: L=3@ (3,3), R=3@ (3,6), U=3@ (1,4), D=3@ (7,4). Meets (1), (2), (3). -> Changes to 4. Correct.\n    *   Ex 3 (3,7)=0: L=3@ (3,6), R=3@ (3,8), U=None, D=3@ (4,7). Meets (1), (2), (3 - D is true). -> Changes to 4. Correct.\n    *   Ex 3 (4,7)=3: L=3@ (4,6), R=None (hits edge). Fails (2). -> Stays 3. Correct.\n    *   Ex 4 (2,3)=0: L=3@ (2,2), R=3@ (2,5), U=3@ (1,3), D=3@ (3,3). Meets (1), (2), (3). -> Changes to 4. Correct. (Ex 4 Output shows (2,3)=4).\n    *   Ex 5 (3,4)=0: L=3@ (3,0?), No, L=3@ (2,4)=3. Recheck rule: scan *in the same row*. L=3@(3,?) No. Fails (2). Wait, looking at Ex 5 output, (3,4) does *not* change. My rule is correct here.\n    *   Ex 5 (3,8)=3: L=3@ (3,7), R=3@ (3,10), U=3@ (2,8), D=3@ (4,8). Meets (1), (2), (3). -> Changes to 4. Output shows (3,8)=4. Correct.\n    *   Ex 5 (5,4)=0: L=3@ (5,3), R=3@ (5,5), U=3@ (4,4), D=3@ (6,4). Meets (1), (2), (3). -> Changes to 4. Output shows (5,4)=4. Correct.\n\nThe refined rule seems correct and consistent across all examples.\n\n**3. Apply the Rule to the Test Input:**\n\nThe rule is: For each cell (r, c):\nOutput[r, c] = 4 IF\n  (Input[r, c] == 0 OR Input[r, c] == 3) AND\n  (Find_Left_3(r, c)) AND\n  (Find_Right_3(r, c)) AND\n  (Find_Up_3(r, c) OR Find_Down_3(r, c))\nELSE\n  Output[r, c] = Input[r, c]\n\nWhere Find_X_3(r, c) checks for the first non-zero cell in that direction being a 3, with only 0s in between.\n\nApplying this systematically to the test grid:\n*   (2,2)=0: L=3@1, R=3@3, U=3@1, D=3@3. -> 4\n*   (3,3)=0: L=3@2, R=3@4, U=3@2, D=3@5. -> 4\n*   (3,9)=0: L=3@8, R=3@10, U=None, D=3@4. -> 4\n*   (4,5)=0: L=3@4, R=3@9, U=3@3, D=3@5. -> 4\n*   (4,6)=0: L=3@4, R=3@9, U=3@3, D=3@5. -> 4\n*   (4,7)=0: L=3@4, R=3@9, U=3@3, D=3@5. -> 4\n*   (4,8)=0: L=3@4, R=3@9, U=3@3, D=3@5. -> 4\n*   (5,9)=0: L=3@8, R=3@10, U=3@4, D=None. -> 4\n*   (7,14)=0: L=3@13, R=3@17, U=3@6, D=3@8. -> 4\n*   (7,15)=0: L=3@13, R=3@17, U=3@6, D=3@9. -> 4\n*   (7,16)=0: L=3@13, R=3@17, U=3@6, D=3@9. -> 4\n*   (8,14)=0: L=3@13, R=3@17, U=3@7, D=3@9. -> 4\n*   (8,15)=0: L=3@13, R=3@17, U=3@7, D=3@9. -> 4\n*   (8,16)=0: L=3@13, R=3@17, U=3@7, D=3@9. -> 4\n*   (10,10)=0: L=3@9, R=3@13, U=3@9, D=3@11. -> 4\n*   (10,11)=0: L=3@9, R=3@13, U=3@9, D=3@11. -> 4\n*   (10,12)=0: L=3@9, R=3@13, U=3@9, D=3@11. -> 4\n*   (12,7)=3: L=3@6, R=3@9, U=3@11, D=3@13. -> 4\n*   (12,8)=0: L=3@7, R=3@9, U=3@11, D=3@13. -> 4\n*   (12,9)=3: L=3@8, R=3@10, U=3@11, D=3@13. -> 4\n*   (12,10)=0: L=3@9, R=3@11, U=3@11, D=3@13. -> 4\n*   (12,11)=0: L=3@10, R=3@12, U=3@11, D=3@18. -> 4\n*   (12,12)=0: L=3@11, R=3@13, U=3@11, D=3@18. -> 4\n*   (14,2)=0: L=3@1, R=3@3, U=3@2, D=3@15. -> 4\n*   (15,4)=0: L=3@3, R=3@6, U=3@14, D=3@18. -> 4\n*   (15,7)=3: L=3@6, R=3@8, U=None, D=3@16. -> 4\n*   (15,8)=3: L=3@7, R=3@9, U=None, D=3@16. -> 4\n*   (15,9)=3: L=3@8, R=3@10, U=None, D=3@16. -> 4\n*   (15,10)=3: L=3@9, R=3@11, U=None, D=3@16. -> 4\n*   (15,11)=3: L=3@10, R=3@12, U=None, D=3@16. -> 4\n*   (16,8)=0: L=3@7, R=3@12, U=3@15, D=3@17. -> 4\n*   (16,9)=0: L=3@7, R=3@12, U=3@15, D=3@17. -> 4\n*   (16,10)=0: L=3@7, R=3@12, U=3@15, D=3@17. -> 4\n*   (16,11)=0: L=3@7, R=3@12, U=3@15, D=3@17. -> 4\n*   (17,8)=0: L=3@7, R=3@12, U=3@16, D=3@18. -> 4\n*   (17,9)=0: L=3@7, R=3@12, U=3@16, D=3@18. -> 4\n*   (17,10)=0: L=3@7, R=3@12, U=3@16, D=3@18. -> 4\n*   (17,11)=0: L=3@7, R=3@12, U=3@16, D=3@18. -> 4\n\nAll other cells retain their original color.\n\n**4.

In the output, both shapes appear to have moved one position to the right. All '6' pixels at (r, c) in the input are at (r, c+1) in the output. All '2' pixels at (r, c) in the input are at (r, c+1) in the output. The background '0' pixels are adjusted accordingly (original non-zero positions become '0', positions receiving a shifted pixel take its color). The grid dimensions (14x9) remain the same. No pixels shift out of bounds.\n    *   Compare Example 2 Input and Output: Observe the single pink '8' shape. In the output, the shape has moved one position to the right. The grid dimensions (8x9) remain the same. Let's check the boundaries. The input has '8's in the last column (column 8). For instance, input(3, 8) is 8. In the output, output(3, 9) would be the target position. However, the grid only has columns 0-8. Looking at the output grid, output(3, 8) is 0, and there is no column 9. The pixel at input(3, 8) seems to have disappeared. Similarly, input(4, 8) = 8 disappears, and input(5, 8) = 8 disappears. This confirms that pixels shifting beyond the right boundary are discarded.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Transformation Rule:**\n    *   The transformation rule is to shift every non-zero pixel one column to the right.\n    *   Formally: For each pixel at position (row `r`, column `c`) in the input grid:\n        *   If input[r][c] is non-zero (let its color be `C`), and if `c+1` is less than the grid width, then output[r][c+1] = `C`.\n        *   If input[r][c] is zero, or if `c+1` is equal to or greater than the grid width (meaning the pixel shifts off the grid), this specific input pixel does not directly place its color in the output grid at `(r, c+1)`.\n    *   All positions in the output grid are initially considered background (0). The non-zero pixels are then placed according to the shift rule. Positions that do not receive a shifted pixel remain 0. This effectively means the original positions of the shifted non-zero pixels become 0, unless another pixel shifts into that exact spot (which doesn't happen with a simple horizontal shift).\n\n3.  **Apply the Rule to the Test Input:**\n    *   The test input grid is 10x10. The non-zero color is 4 (cyan).\n    *   Identify all pixels with value 4.\n    *   For each pixel (r, c) with value 4, calculate its target position (r, c+1).\n    *   Create a new 10x10 grid initialized with zeros.\n    *   Iterate through the input grid's non-zero pixels:\n        *   Input(1, 1..6) = 4 -> Output(1, 2..7) = 4\n        *   Input(2, 1) = 4 -> Output(2, 2) = 4\n        *   Input(2, 7) = 4 -> Output(2, 8) = 4\n        *   Input(3, 2) = 4 -> Output(3, 3) = 4\n        *   Input(3, 8) = 4 -> Output(3, 9) = 4\n        *   Input(4, 3) = 4 -> Output(4, 4) = 4\n        *   Input(4, 9) = 4 -> Target(4, 10). Since column 10 is out of bounds (grid width is 10, columns 0-9), this pixel is discarded.\n        *   Input(5, 4..9) = 4 -> Output(5, 5..9) = 4, and Input(5,9)=4 targeting Output(5,10) is discarded.

(This worked for most examples, except Ex 3 Color 1).\n\n5.  **Apply Rule to Test Input:**\n    *   **Identify Objects:**\n        *   P1: Color 4 pixel at (4, 11). H=1, W=1.\n        *   P2: Color 4 pixel at (5, 11). H=1, W=1.\n        *   O8: Color 8 shape `[[8,8,8],[8,0,8],[8,0,8]]` at (7, 6). H=3, W=3.\n        *   O2: Color 2 line `[[2],[2],[2]]` at (7, 11). H=3, W=1.\n        *   O3: Color 3 line `[[3,3,3]]` at (11, 6). H=1, W=3.\n    *   **Identify Stable Shape:** None of the exact stable shapes (8, Cross, 5) are present in the test input. The Color 8 shape is close but different.\n    *   **Assume Default Parameters:** Since no stable shape is present, we need a default behavior. The most frequent parameters seem to be Dist=3 or 4, Style=Simple, NumCopies=3. Let's assume parameters similar to the 8-shape case as it's visually closest: VertDist=4, HorizDist=3, Style=Simple, NumCopies=3. Use the H=W Parity Rule for direction.\n    *   **Process Each Object:**\n        *   P1 (C=4, (4, 11)): H=W. Parity E/O -> Dir=Horizontal. Dist=3. Style=Simple. Nc=3. Replicate horizontally with distance 3. Locations: (4, 11), (4, 14), (4, 17).\n        *   P2 (C=4, (5, 11)): H=W. Parity O/O -> Dir=Vertical. Dist=4. Style=Simple. Nc=3. Replicate vertically with distance 4. Locations: (5, 11), (9, 11), (13, 11).\n        *   O8 (C=8, (7, 6)): H=W. Parity O/E -> Dir=Horizontal. Dist=3. Style=Simple. Nc=3. Replicate horizontally with distance 3. Locations: (7-9, 6-8), (7-9, 9-11), (7-9, 12-14).\n        *   O2 (C=2, (7, 11)): H>W. Dir=Horizontal. Dist=3. Style=Simple. Nc=3. Replicate horizontally with distance 3. Locations: (7-9, 11), (7-9, 14), (7-9, 17).\n        *   O3 (C=3, (11, 6)): W>H. Dir=Vertical. Dist=4. Style=Simple. Nc=3. Replicate vertically with distance 4. Locations: (11, 6-8), (15, 6-8), (19, 6-8).\n    *   **Construct Output Grid (Union):** Initialize a 21x21 grid with 0s. Draw all pixels from all copies of all objects, letting later draws overwrite earlier ones if overlaps occur (or simply taking the union, assuming distinct colors won't overlap in final design). Let's use the union approach where the final color at a location is determined by the last object drawn covering that location in the sequence P1, P2, O8, O2, O3. But simpler is just drawing each object's color. Let's assume the union: if multiple objects want to draw a color at (r,c), the highest color index prevails, or perhaps the object processed last. Let's just draw all points calculated.\n        *   Draw C=4: (4,11), (4,14), (4,17), (5,11), (9,11), (13,11).\n        *   Draw C=3: (11,6), (11,7), (11,8), (15,6), (15,7), (15,8), (19,6), (19,7), (19,8).\n        *   Draw C=2: (7,11), (8,11), (9,11), (7,14), (8,14), (9,14), (7,17), (8,17), (9,17).\n        *   Draw C=8:\n            Box 1 (7-9, 6-8): (7,6),(7,7),(7,8), (8,6),(8,8), (9,6),(9,8).\n            Box 2 (7-9, 9-11): (7,9),(7,10),(7,11), (8,9),(8,11), (9,9),(9,11).\n            Box 3 (7-9, 12-14): (7,12),(7,13),(7,14), (8,12),(8,14), (9,12),(9,14).\n\n6.  **Final Grid Construction and Overlap Resolution:**\n    Create the grid and populate it based on the calculated coordinates. Use the color of the object being replicated. For overlaps, the standard ARC approach is often that the input pixels take precedence, or simply the union is taken. Let's assume the union of all generated pixels, keeping the original color specified for each replication.\n    Grid (21x21):\n    Row 4: ...4..0..0..4..0..4... (Cols 11, 14, 17)\n    Row 5: ...4............... (Col 11)\n    Row 7: ......888.888.888.2.0.2.. (Cols 6-8, 9-11, 12-14 for 8; Col 11, 14, 17 for 2)\n    Row 8: ......808.808.808.2.0.2.. (Cols 6,8, 9,11, 12,14 for 8; Col 11, 14, 17 for 2)\n    Row 9: ......808.808.808.4.0.2.. (Cols 6,8, 9,11, 12,14 for 8; Col 11 for 4; Col 11, 14, 17 for 2) -> Col 11 is C4 due to P2 replication. Col 14, 17 are C2. Cols 9,11,12,14 are C8.\n    Row 11: ......333............\n    Row 13: ...4............... (Col 11)\n    Row 15: ......333............\n    Row 19: ......333............\n\n    Let's build carefully, cell by cell, assuming union overwrites 0s. If colors overlap, the highest color index wins? Or the last drawn? Let's assume last drawn (Order: 4, 3, 2, 8).\n    Grid init to 0.\n    Draw C4 P1: (4,11)=4, (4,14)=4, (4,17)=4\n    Draw C4 P2: (5,11)=4, (9,11)=4, (13,11)=4\n    Draw C3 O3: (11,6)=3,(11,7)=3,(11,8)=3, (15,6)=3,(15,7)=3,(15,8)=3, (19,6)=3,(19,7)=3,(19,8)=3\n    Draw C2 O2: (7,11)=2, (8,11)=2, (9,11)=2 (overwrites C4), (7,14)=2, (8,14)=2, (9,14)=2, (7,17)=2, (8,17)=2, (9,17)=2\n    Draw C8 O8:\n      Copy1: (7,6)=8,(7,7)=8,(7,8)=8, (8,6)=8,(8,8)=8, (9,6)=8,(9,8)=8\n      Copy2: (7,9)=8,(7,10)=8,(7,11)=8 (overwrites C2), (8,9)=8,(8,11)=8 (overwrites C2), (9,9)=8,(9,11)=8 (overwrites C2)\n      Copy3: (7,12)=8,(7,13)=8,(7,14)=8 (overwrites C2), (8,12)=8,(8,14)=8 (overwrites C2), (9,12)=8,(9,14)=8 (overwrites C2)\n\n    This \"last drawn\" rule results in C8 dominating C2/C4 in overlaps.\n\n```json\n[\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,2,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,8,0,8,8,0,8,0,0,2,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\n```\n\nRethinking Overlap: Often, the original input pixels are preserved.

Let's denote the left grid as `L` and the right grid as `R`, and the output grid as `O`.\n\n4.  **Test Hypothesis with Example 1:**\n    *   Input: `[[1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   `L = [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`\n    *   `R = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Output: `O = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]]`\n    *   Compare `L[i][j]` and `R[i][j]` to get `O[i][j]`:\n        *   `L[0][0]=1`, `R[0][0]=0` -> `O[0][0]=0`\n        *   `L[0][1]=0`, `R[0][1]=1` -> `O[0][1]=0`\n        *   `L[0][2]=0`, `R[0][2]=0` -> `O[0][2]=0`\n        *   `L[1][0]=0`, `R[1][0]=1` -> `O[1][0]=0`\n        *   `L[1][1]=1`, `R[1][1]=1` -> `O[1][1]=2`\n        *   `L[1][2]=0`, `R[1][2]=1` -> `O[1][2]=0`\n        *   `L[2][0]=1`, `R[2][0]=0` -> `O[2][0]=0`\n        *   `L[2][1]=0`, `R[2][1]=0` -> `O[2][1]=0`\n        *   `L[2][2]=0`, `R[2][2]=0` -> `O[2][2]=0`\n    *   The rule appears to be: `O[i][j] = 2` if `L[i][j] == 1` AND `R[i][j] == 1`. Otherwise, `O[i][j] = 0`.\n\n5.  **Verify Hypothesis with Example 2:**\n    *   Input: `[[1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0]]`\n    *   `L = [[1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]`\n    *   `R = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\n    *   Expected Output (based on rule):\n        *   `L[0][1]=1`, `R[0][1]=1` -> `O[0][1]=2`\n        *   `L[1][2]=1`, `R[1][2]=1` -> `O[1][2]=2`\n        *   `L[2][1]=1`, `R[2][1]=1` -> `O[2][1]=2`\n        *   All other positions have at least one 0 in L or R, so O should be 0.\n        *   Calculated O: `[[0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 2], [0, 2, 0]]`\n    *   This matches Example 2 Output.\n\n6.  **Verify Hypothesis with Example 3:**\n    *   Input: `[[0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 5, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 5, 1, 0, 1]]`\n    *   `L = [[0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]`\n    *   `R = [[0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1]]`\n    *   Expected Output (based on rule):\n        *   `L[1][0]=1`, `R[1][0]=1` -> `O[1][0]=2`\n        *   `L[2][2]=1`, `R[2][2]=1` -> `O[2][2]=2`\n        *   All other positions have at least one 0 in L or R, so O should be 0.\n        *   Calculated O: `[[0, 0, 0], [2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2]]`\n    *   This matches Example 3 Output.\n\n7.  **Confirm the Rule:** The transformation rule is:\n    *   Identify the separator column (color 5, index 3).\n    *   Extract the 3x3 subgrid `L` to the left of the separator (columns 0-2).\n    *   Extract the 3x3 subgrid `R` to the right of the separator (columns 4-6).\n    *   Create the 3x3 output grid `O`.

The grids feature a background color (0), a separator color (varies: 8, 1, 4), and object colors (various). The separators form compartments, typically 2x2 cells for objects, separated by single lines of the separator color. The objects are usually 1x2 blocks within these 2x2 compartments. The transformation involves filling empty compartments based on the colors of neighboring compartments, likely involving both horizontal and vertical filling or propagation.\n\nHypothesis Development and Testing:\n\n1.  **Initial Observations:** Objects seem to fill empty space horizontally and sometimes vertically.\n2.  **Hypothesis 1-7 (Simple Propagation/Interpolation):** Tried various simple horizontal propagation rules (fill right, fill between same color, blocked by others) and vertical interpolation (fill if above/below match). These failed to explain all examples, particularly the interaction between horizontal and vertical changes and why some fills occur and others don't.\n3.  **Hypothesis 8 (H-fill between same, then V-interpolation):** This worked for Example 1 but failed for Example 2 (missing fill) and Example 3 (incorrect fill).\n4.  **Hypothesis 9 (H-fill between same, then V-propagation):** Failed Example 1.\n5.  **Hypothesis 10/12 (H-fill between same, then V-fill between same):** Worked for Ex 1 and 2, but failed Ex 3 (incorrectly filled a cell vertically).\n6.  **Hypothesis 11 (H-fill between same, then V-fill *only* if column has single color):** Worked for Ex 1 and 3, but failed Ex 2 (missed a necessary vertical fill).\n7.  **Hypothesis 13 (H-fill, then V-fill blocked by intermediate object):** Failed Ex 3.\n8.  **Hypothesis 14 (V-fill between same, then H-fill between same):** Worked for Ex 1 and 3, but failed Ex 2 (missed a vertical fill because the required pair wasn't present after only V-fill).\n9.  **Hypothesis 15 (Iterative V-fill + H-fill, standard fill):** Worked for Ex 1 and 2, but failed Ex 3 (performed an incorrect vertical fill in a later iteration). This suggested iteration might be involved, but the fill condition was wrong.\n10. **Hypothesis 16 (V/H fills determined *only* from input, then applied):** Worked for Ex 1 and 3, but failed Ex 2 (missed an interactive fill).\n11. **Hypothesis 17 (Conditional V-fill(input col=1 color), then H-fill):** Same failure as Hyp 14.\n12. **Hypothesis 18 (Iterative V-fill(conditional on current col=1 color) + H-fill):** Worked for Ex 1 and 3, but failed Ex 2 (vertical fill condition too strict).\n13. **Hypothesis 19 (Iterative V-fill(standard) + H-fill, but V-fill only allowed if input column had <=1 color):** This combines iteration (needed for Ex 2) with a condition based on the input state (needed to prevent wrong fill in Ex 3).\n    - **Vertical Fill Rule:** Use standard \"fill between same color\" logic.\n    - **Horizontal Fill Rule:** Use standard \"fill between same color\" logic.\n    - **Condition:** Vertical fill in a column `c` is only active if the *initial input grid* had objects of at most one color in that column.\n    - **Iteration:** Repeat V-fill and H-fill passes until no changes occur.\n\nTesting Hypothesis 19:\n- **Example 1:** Input C0={22, 33}, C2={11, 33}, C4={22}. V-fill allowed only in C4.\n    - Pass 1a (V): Fill (2,4)=22.\n    - Pass 1b (H): Fill R1(1..3)=22, R4(1)=33.\n    - Pass 2: No changes. -> Matches output. Correct.\n- **Example 2:** Input C0={22}, C2={99}, C3={44}, C4={88}, C5={88}, C6={99, 88}. V-fill allowed in C0, C2, C3, C4, C5. Blocked C6.\n    - Pass 1a (V): Fill C0(2..4)=22.\n    - Pass 1b (H): Fill R3(3..5)=99, R6(5)=88.\n    - Pass 2a (V): C5 sees (4,5)=88, (6,5)=88. Fill (5,5)=88.\n    - Pass 2b (H): No change.\n    - Pass 3: No changes. -> Matches output. Correct.\n- **Example 3:** Input C1={33}, C2={22}, C4={22, 33}, C5={22}. V-fill allowed C1, C2, C5. Blocked C4.\n    - Pass 1a (V): Fill C1(2..6)=33.\n    - Pass 1b (H): Fill R3(3..4)=22, R7(2..3)=33.\n    - Pass 2a (V): No change (C4 blocked).\n    - Pass 2b (H): No change.\n    - Stop. -> Matches output. Correct.\n\nHypothesis 19 is consistent with all examples.\n\nApplying Hypothesis 19 to Test Input:\n\n1.  **Grid Structure:** Separator=4(Blue), Bg=0(Black), Compartment=2x2 non-separator cells.
