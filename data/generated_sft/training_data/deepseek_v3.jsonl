The output grid replaces some 8s with other numbers (2, 3, 7) and removes all 1s.\n   - The 1s in the input seem to be associated with the transformation of 8s. Specifically, the number replacing 8s appears to be the count of 1s in the input grid.\n\n2. **Counting 1s**:\n   - Example 1: There are 5 cells with 1 (forming a small cross shape). The 8s are replaced with 2. 5 - 3 = 2 (but this doesn't fit).\n   - Example 2: There are 5 cells with 1 (forming a small cross and an extra 1). The 8s are replaced with 3. 5 - 2 = 3.\n   - Example 3: There are 5 cells with 1 (forming a small cross). The 8s are replaced with 2. 5 - 3 = 2.\n   - Example 4: There are 7 cells with 1 (forming a pattern). The 8s are replaced with 7. Direct count matches.\n   - Example 5: There are 5 cells with 1 (forming a small cross). The 8s are replaced with 3. 5 - 2 = 3.\n\n   The pattern isn't perfectly clear, but the number replacing 8s seems to be related to the count of 1s minus some number (possibly the number of 1s in the largest connected component).\n\n3. **Alternative Approach**:\n   - Another observation is that the replacement number might correspond to the number of distinct \"objects\" formed by 1s. \n   - Example 1: One cross (5 cells) \u2192 2.\n   - Example 2: One cross (5 cells) \u2192 3.\n   - Example 3: One cross (5 cells) \u2192 2.\n   - Example 4: One larger shape (7 cells) \u2192 7.\n   - Example 5: One cross (5 cells) \u2192 3.\n\n   This also doesn't fit perfectly. \n\n4. **Final Rule**:\n   - The most consistent rule is that the number replacing 8s is equal to the total count of 1s in the input grid minus 3 (as seen in Examples 1, 3, and 5). \n   - For Example 1: 5 - 3 = 2.\n   - For Example 3: 5 - 3 = 2.\n   - For Example 5: 5 - 2 = 3 (but this is inconsistent).\n   - For Example 4: 7 - 0 = 7 (if we consider no subtraction).\n\n   Given the inconsistency, the simplest rule is to replace all 8s with the total count of 1s in the input grid.\n\n5. **Applying to Test Input**:\n   - Count the number of 1s in the test input: there are 7 cells with 1 (forming a small cross and an extra 1).\n   - Replace all 8s with 7 and remove all 1s.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 6667, "completion_tokens": 1299}

The output grids replace the `0`s inside these `2`-outlined shapes with other numbers (`8`, `4`, `3`), while leaving the `2`s and outside `0`s unchanged.\n\n2. **Determine the Replacement Value**: The replacement number seems to be consistent within each shape but varies between shapes. For example, in the first example, all inside `0`s are replaced with `8`; in the second, with `4`; and in the third, some shapes use `3` and others `8`.\n\n3. **Shape Isolation**: Each `2`-outlined shape is treated independently. The replacement number is likely determined by the size or position of the shape, but the examples don't show a clear pattern (e.g., `8` is used for both small and large shapes).\n\n4. **Apply to Test Input**: The test input has multiple `2`-outlined shapes. We'll replace the `0`s inside each shape with a unique number (e.g., `8` for the first shape, `4` for the next, etc.), keeping the `2`s and outside `0`s unchanged.\n\n5. **Consistency Check**: Ensure that all `0`s inside `2`-outlined shapes are replaced, and no other cells are altered.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Patterns in Input-Output Pairs**:\n   - **Example 1**: \n     - Input has 4s and 8s; output changes 4s to 3s and adds new 4s below some 3s. Also, 8s remain, but new 8s appear in rows below the original 8s.\n   - **Example 2**: \n     - Input has 4s and 8s; output changes some 4s to 3s and fills rows with 8s where there were sequences of 4s and 8s in the input.\n   - **Example 3**: \n     - Input has 4s and 8s; output changes some 4s to 3s and fills rows with 8s below the original 8s, similar to the other examples.\n\n2. **Deduce the Transformation Rule**:\n   - The rule seems to involve:\n     - Changing certain 4s to 3s (likely the topmost or first occurrences in a column).\n     - Filling rows below the original 8s with 8s, especially where there were sequences of 4s or other numbers in the input.\n     - Preserving 2s and other numbers unless they are part of a sequence being transformed.\n\n3. **Apply the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - The test input has 2s, 4s, and 8s. Following the pattern:\n     - The topmost 4s in columns should be changed to 3s.\n     - Rows below the original 8s should be filled with 8s where there are sequences of 4s or other numbers.\n     - 2s should remain unchanged unless they are part of a sequence being transformed.\n\n4. **Verify Consistency**:\n   - Check that the transformation aligns with the examples:\n     - In Example 1, the first 4s in columns became 3s, and rows below 8s were filled with 8s.\n     - Similarly, in the test input, the first 4s in columns should become 3s, and rows below 8s should be filled with 8s.\n\n5. **Generate the Output Grid**:\n   - Implement the deduced rule on the test input to produce the output grid.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \u6781, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0\u6781, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, \u6781, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0\u6781, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 19081, "completion_tokens": 3265}

We have several input-output grid pairs, and based on these examples, I need to deduce a hidden transformation rule. Then, I should apply this rule to a new test input grid to generate the corresponding output grid.\n\n### Analyzing the Examples\n\nLet's look at the provided examples one by one to identify patterns or rules.\n\n#### Example 1:\n\n**Input:**\n```\n[\n [4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 4, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 3, 2, 4, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 7, 3, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n[\n [4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 7, 4, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 7, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n**Observations:**\n1. The first row remains unchanged: `[4, 2, ...]` stays `[4, 2, ...]`.\n2. In the second row, the `4` at position (1,6) changes to `2`.\n3. Looking at the `3`s and `7`s in the input, they seem to be swapping or transforming in some way in the output.\n4. The `4`s in the input are becoming `2`s in the output, and vice versa in some places.\n5. The `7`s are becoming `3`s, and `3`s are becoming `7`s in certain contexts.\n\n**Possible Rule:**\nIt seems like there's a swapping of numbers based on their adjacency or some pattern. Specifically:\n- `3` and `7` are being swapped.\n- `2` and `4` are being swapped.\nBut this doesn't hold everywhere, so maybe it's more about swapping colors in certain regions.\n\nWait, looking more carefully:\n- Wherever there's a `3` in the input, it's a `7` in the output, and vice versa.\n- Similarly, `2` and `4` are swapped.\n- `0`s remain `0`s.\n\nLet me check this hypothesis with the other examples.\n\n#### Example 2:\n\n**Input:**\n```\n[\n [1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n[\n [1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 1, 1, 8, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n**Applying the Previous Hypothesis:**\n- `1` and `3` seem to be swapped:\n  - Input `1` becomes `3` in output (e.g., at (1,6)).\n  - Input `3` becomes `1` in output (e.g., at (4,2)).\n- `2` and `8` seem to be swapped:\n  - Input `2` becomes `8` (but in the first row, `2` stays `2`? Wait no, the first row's `2` is at (1,0) in input, which is `2` in output too. Hmm.\n  - At (4,7), `8` becomes `2`.\n  - At (5,6) and (5,7), `8` becomes `2`.\n  - At (6,4), `2` becomes `8`.\n  \nThis seems inconsistent with the first example's rule. Maybe the swapping pairs are different in each example. Alternatively, maybe the rule is to swap the two most frequent non-zero numbers in the grid.\n\nLet me check the frequency in Example 1:\n- Counts: `0` many, `2` appears a few times, `3` appears several, `4` several, `7` several.\n- Maybe swap the two most frequent non-zero numbers: `3` and `7` are frequent, and they are swapped in the output.\nIn Example 2:\n- Counts: `1` appears many times, `3` several, `2` several, `8` several.\n- Maybe swap `1` and `3`, and `2` and `8`.\n\nThis seems to fit:\n- In Example 1: swap `3` \u2194 `7` and `2` \u2194 `4`.\n- In Example 2: swap `1` \u2194 `3` and `2` \u2194 `8`.\n- In Example 3: let's check.\n\n#### Example 3:\n\n**Input:**\n```\n[\n [9, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 9, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 7, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n[\n [9, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 6, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n**Applying the Hypothesis:**\n- Count non-zero numbers:\n  - `9`: appears 3 times\n  - `4`: appears 3 times\n  - `7`: appears 4 times\n  - `6`: appears 5 times\n- Most frequent: `6` and `7` (swap them), then next `4` and `9` (swap them).\n- Indeed:\n  - `6` \u2194 `7` (e.g., at (1,1) `6` stays `6`? Wait no, input (1,1) is `6`, output is `6` - not swapped. Maybe not swapping the first row.\n  - At (5,3): `6` \u2192 `7`, at (5,4): `6` \u2192 `7`.\n  - At (6,3): `7` \u2192 `6`, at (6,5): `6` \u2192 `7`.\n  - `4` and `9` swaps: at (0,1) `4` stays `4`, at (1,5) `9` \u2192 `4`, at (2,6) `9` \u2192 `4`, at (3,5) `4` \u2192 `9`, at (4,5) `4` \u2192 `9`.\n  \nThis seems partially correct but a bit messy. Maybe the rule is to swap the two most frequent non-zero numbers (excluding the first row), and if there's a tie, choose the larger ones or some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's always swap `A` \u2194 `B` and `C` \u2194 `D` where `A,B,C,D` are the four most frequent numbers in some order.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the simplest consistent rule is: for the two most frequent non-zero numbers in the grid (excluding the first row), swap them everywhere in the grid (including the first row), and do the same for the next two most frequent.\n\nLet me proceed with this for the test input.\n\n### Test Input:\n\n**Input:**\n```\n[\n [8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 9, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n**Step 1: Count non-zero numbers (excluding first row):**\n- `2`: appears at (1,0), (3,3), (4,3), (4,5), (5,3), (5,4), (6,3), (7,3) \u2192 8 times\n- `4`: appears at (1,1), (4,4), (5,5), (6,1), (6,4), (7,1), (7,4), (8,5) \u2192 8 times\n- `8`: appears at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), (3,5) \u2192 5 times\n- `9`: appears at (1,5), (1,6), (2,6), (3,6), (7,3) \u2192 5 times\n\n**Step 2: Most frequent are `2` and `4` (8 times each), next are `8` and `9` (5 times each).**\n\n**Step 3: Swap `2` \u2194 `4` and `8` \u2194 `9` everywhere in the grid (including first row).**\n\n**Applying the swaps:**\n- First row: `[8,9,...]` \u2192 `[9,8,...]` (since `8` \u2194 `9`)\n- Second row: `[2,4,...]` \u2192 `[4,2,...]`, `9`s become `8`s\n- Third row: `8`s become `9`s, `9` becomes `8`\n- And so on.\n\n**Constructing the Output:**\nLet's go row by row:\n\n1. `[8,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]` \u2192 `[9,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`\n2. `[2,4,0,0,0,9,9,0,0,0]` \u2192 `[4,2,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0]`\n3. `[0,0,0,8,8,8,9,0,0,0]` \u2192 `[0,0,0,9,9,9,8,0,0,0]`\n4. `[0,0,0,2,8,8,9,0,0,0]` \u2192 `[0,0,0,4,9,9,8,0,0,0]`\n5. `[0,0,0,2,4,2,0,0,0,0]` \u2192 `[0,0,0,4,2,4,0,0,0,0]`\n6. `[0,0,0,2,2,4,0,0,0,0]` \u2192 `[0,0,0,4,4,2,0,0,0,0]`\n7. `[0,0,0,2,4,4,0,0,0,0]` \u2192 `[0,0,0,4,2,2,0,0,0,0]`\n8. `[0,0,0,9,4,4,0,0,0,0]` \u2192 `[0,0,0,8,2,2,0,0,0,0]`\n9. `", "prompt_tokens": 2281, "completion_tokens": 4096}

Otherwise, it's `0`.\n   - Alternatively, it might be the other way around: where the first part is `0` and the second part is `6`.\n\n5. **Testing the Rule**:\n   - Let's test this on Example 1:\n     - First row of first part: `[0, 2, 2, 0]`\n     - Corresponding rows in second part (after `[7,7,7,7]`): `[0,6,6,0]`, `[0,0,0,0]`, `[6,6,6,6]`, `[6,6,0,6]`, `[0,6,6,6]`, `[0,0,6,0]`\n     - For the first output row `[8,0,0,8]`:\n       - First cell: first part `0`, second part `0` \u2192 output `8` (doesn't match the rule)\n       - Maybe it's where first part is `2` and second part is `6`:\n         - First output row: first part `[0,2,2,0]`, second part `[0,6,6,0]` \u2192 positions where first is `2` and second is `6`: positions 1 and 2 \u2192 output `[0,8,8,0]` but actual output is `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 doesn't match.\n   - Alternative rule: output `8` where first part is `0` and second part is `6`:\n     - First output row: first part `[0,2,2,0]`, second part `[0,6,6,0]` \u2192 positions where first is `0` and second is `6`: positions 1 and 2 \u2192 output `[0,8,8,0]` but actual is `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n   - Maybe it's the first part is `2` and the corresponding cell in the second part is not `6`:\n     - First output row: first part `[0,2,2,0]`, second part `[0,6,6,0]` \u2192 positions where first is `2` and second is not `6`: none \u2192 output `[0,0,0,0]` but actual is `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n   - Maybe it's XOR-like: where first part is `2` or second part is `6` but not both:\n     - First output row: first `[0,2,2,0]`, second `[0,6,6,0]`:\n       - position 0: first `0`, second `0` \u2192 neither \u2192 output `0` (actual `8`)\n       - position 1: first `2`, second `6` \u2192 both \u2192 output `0` (actual `0`)\n       - position 2: same as 1 \u2192 `0` (actual `0`)\n       - position 3: first `0`, second `0` \u2192 `0` (actual `8`)\n     - Doesn't match.\n\n6. **Alternative Approach**:\n   - Maybe the output is `8` where the sum of the corresponding cells in the first and second parts is `6`:\n     - First output row: first `[0,2,2,0]`, second `[0,6,6,0]` \u2192 sums `[0,8,8,0]` \u2192 output `[0,0,0,0]` but actual `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n   - Maybe where the first part is `2` and the second part is `0`:\n     - First output row: first `[0,2,2,0]`, second `[0,6,6,0]` \u2192 no `0`s in second \u2192 output `[0,0,0,0]` but actual `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n\n7. **Re-examining Examples**:\n   - Maybe the output is `8` where the first part is `0` and the second part is not `0`:\n     - First output row: first `[0,2,2,0]`, second `[0,6,6,0]` \u2192 positions where first is `0` and second is not `0`: 1 and 2 \u2192 output `[0,8,8,0]` but actual `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n   - Maybe the output is `8` where the first part is `0` and the second part is `6`:\n     - First output row: first `[0,2,2,0]`, second `[0,6,6,0]` \u2192 positions where first is `0` and second is `6`: 1 and 2 \u2192 output `[0,8,8,0]` but actual `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n   - Maybe the output is `8` where the first part is `2` and the second part is `6`:\n     - First output row: first `[0,2,2,0]`, second `[0,6,6,0]` \u2192 positions where first is `2` and second is `6`: 1 and 2 \u2192 output `[0,8,8,0]` but actual `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n\n8. **Considering Row Pairs**:\n   - Maybe the output is formed by comparing the first 6 rows with the next 6 rows (after the all-7s row), and `8` appears where the first part is `2` and the corresponding cell in the second part is `6`:\n     - For Example 1:\n       - First output row: first `[0,2,2,0]`, second `[0,6,6,0]` \u2192 `[0,8,8,0]` but actual `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n     - Maybe it's where the first part is `0` and the second part is `6`:\n       - First output row: `[0,8,8,0]` vs actual `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 not matching.\n   - Maybe the output is `8` where the first part is `2` and the second part is not `6`:\n     - First output row: first `[0,2,2,0]`, second `[0,6,6,0]` \u2192 positions where first is `2` and second is not `6`: none \u2192 `[0,0,0,0]` but actual `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n\n9. **Alternative Idea**:\n   - Maybe the output is `8` where the first part is `0` and the second part is `6`, or first part is `2` and second part is not `6`:\n     - First output row: first `[0,2,2,0]`, second `[0,6,6,0]`:\n       - position 0: first `0`, second `0` \u2192 not `6` \u2192 `0`\n       - position 1: first `2`, second `6` \u2192 `0`\n       - position 2: same as 1 \u2192 `0`\n       - position 3: first `0`, second `0` \u2192 `0`\n       - output `[0,0,0,0]` but actual `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n\n10. **Final Attempt**:\n    - Maybe the output is `8` where the first part is `0` and the second part is `6`, or first part is `2` and second part is `0`:\n      - First output row: first `[0,2,2,0]`, second `[0,6,6,0]`:\n        - position 0: first `0`, second `0` \u2192 `0`\n        - position 1: first `2`, second `6` \u2192 `0`\n        - position 2: same \u2192 `0`\n        - position 3: first `0`, second `0` \u2192 `0`\n        - output `[0,0,0,0]` but actual `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the rule is to map `2` in the first part to `0` in the output and `0` in the first part to `8` in the output, ignoring the second part. But this doesn't match the examples.\n\n### Revisiting Examples\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nFirst part first row: `[0,2,2,0]`, output first row: `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 seems like `0` maps to `8` and `2` maps to `0`.\n\nBut in Example 2:\n\nFirst part first row: `[2,2,0,2]`, output first row: `[0,0,0,0]` \u2192 `2` maps to `0`, `0` maps to `0` \u2192 inconsistent with Example 1.\n\nAlternative idea: output is `8` where the first part is `0` and the corresponding cell in the second part is `6`:\n\n- Example 1 first output row: first `[0,2,2,0]`, second `[0,6,6,0]` \u2192 `[0,0,0,0]` but actual `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n\nThis is perplexing. Maybe the output is `8` where the first part is `0` and the second part is not `6`:\n\n- Example 1 first output row: first `[0,2,2,0]`, second `[0,6,6,0]` \u2192 `[0,0,0,0]` but actual `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n\n### Possible Correct Rule\n\nAfter careful observation, the rule seems to be:\n\n- For each cell in the first 6 rows of the input, if the corresponding cell in the second part (rows after the all-7s row) is `6`, then the output is `8` if the first part is `0`, and `0` otherwise. If the second part is not `6`, the output is `0`.\n\nBut testing this:\n\nExample 1 first output row:\nFirst part `[0,2,2,0]`, second part `[0,6,6,0]`:\n- position 0: first `0`, second `0` \u2192 not `6` \u2192 `0`\n- position 1: first `2`, second `6` \u2192 `0`\n- position 2: first `2`, second `6` \u2192 `0`\n- position 3: first `0`, second `0` \u2192 `0`\nOutput `[0,0,0,0]` but actual `[8,0,0,8]` \u2192 no.\n\nAlternative rule: output is `8` where the first part is `0` and the second part is `0`:\n\nExample 1 first output row:\nFirst `[0,2,2,0]`, second `[0,6,6,0]`:\n- position 0: first `0`, second `0` \u2192 `8`\n- position 1: first `2`, second `6` \u2192 `0`\n- position 2: same \u2192 `0`\n- position 3: first `0`, second `0` \u2192 `8`\nOutput `[8,0,0,8]` which matches.\n\nCheck other examples:\n\nExample 2 first output row:\nFirst `[2,2,0,2]`, second `[6,0,6,6]`:\n- position 0: first `2`, second `6` \u2192 `0`\n- position 1: first `2`, second `0` \u2192 ?\nWait, rule: first is `0` and second is `0` \u2192 `8`, else `0`.\nHere, position 1: first `2` \u2192 `0`\nposition 2: first `0`, second `6` \u2192 `0`\nposition 3: first `2`, second `6` \u2192 `0`\nOutput `[0,0,0,0]` which matches.\n\nExample 3 first output row:\nFirst `[0,0,0,2]`, second `[6,0,6,6]`:\n- position 0: first `0`, second `6` \u2192 `0`\n- position 1: first `0`, second `0` \u2192 `8`\n- position 2: first `0`, second `6` \u2192 `0`", "prompt_tokens": 1258, "completion_tokens": 4096}

{"task_id": "15696249", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free", "raw_response": "### Understanding the Problem\n\nFirst, I carefully examined the provided input-output pairs to identify any patterns or rules governing the transformation from input to output grids. The input grids are all 3x3, while the output grids are larger, specifically 9x9. This immediately suggests that the transformation involves expanding the input grid in some systematic way.\n\n### Analyzing Example 1\n\n**Input:**\n```\n[[4, 4, 6],\n [3, 3, 3],\n [6, 6, 4]]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6],\n [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n [6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 4],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n**Observations:**\n1. The output grid is 9x9, which is 3 times the size of the input grid in both dimensions.\n2. The input grid's rows are repeated horizontally and vertically in the output grid.\n   - The 4th row of the output is the first input row repeated three times: `[4,4,6,4,4,6,4,4,6]`.\n   - The 5th row is the second input row repeated three times: `[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]`.\n   - The 6th row is the third input row repeated three times: `[6,6,4,6,6,4,6,6,4]`.\n3. The first three and last three rows of the output are filled with zeros, acting as padding.\n\n### Analyzing Example 2\n\n**Input:**\n```\n[[2, 4, 3],\n [2, 3, 4],\n [2, 3, 4]]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n[[2, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n**Observations:**\n1. Similar to Example 1, the output is 9x9.\n2. Here, the input rows are repeated vertically but not horizontally. Each input row is followed by two rows of zeros in the output.\n   - The first three output rows are the input rows with zeros appended: `[2,4,3,0,0,0,0,0,0]`, etc.\n   - This pattern repeats three times vertically.\n\nThis seems inconsistent with Example 1, where rows were repeated horizontally. This suggests that the transformation rule might not be uniform across examples, or there's a more nuanced pattern.\n\n### Analyzing Example 3\n\n**Input:**\n```\n[[1, 1, 1],\n [6, 2, 2],\n [2, 2, 6]]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [6, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2],\n [2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 6],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n**Observations:**\n1. The first three rows of the output are the input rows repeated horizontally three times.\n2. The remaining six rows are filled with zeros.\n\nThis is similar to Example 1 but without the vertical repetition of input rows. Instead, only the first three input rows are expanded horizontally, and the rest are zeros.\n\n### Analyzing Example 4\n\n**Input:**\n```\n[[3, 1, 6],\n [3, 6, 1],\n [3, 1, 6]]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n[[3, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [3, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n**Observations:**\n1. Similar to Example 2, the input rows are repeated vertically with zeros appended to each row.\n2. The pattern is repeated three times vertically, with each input row followed by two more copies of itself in the output, but with zeros after the initial three elements.\n\n### Identifying the Transformation Rule\n\nFrom the examples, it appears that the transformation involves expanding the input grid into a 9x9 grid by repeating the input rows either horizontally or vertically, sometimes with padding of zeros. However, the exact rule isn't consistent across all examples:\n\n- **Example 1 & 3:** Input rows are repeated horizontally to fill the first few rows, and the rest are zeros.\n- **Example 2 & 4:** Input rows are repeated vertically with zeros appended to each row.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the rule might depend on some property of the input grid, such as the values or their arrangement. Alternatively, there might be a misinterpretation.\n\nUpon closer inspection, a possible unifying rule is:\n\n1. **Horizontal Expansion:** Each input row is repeated three times horizontally to form a row in the output.\n2. **Vertical Placement:** These expanded rows are placed in the output grid starting from a certain row, with other rows filled with zeros.\n   - In Examples 1 and 3, the expanded rows start at row 4 and row 1, respectively.\n   - In Examples 2 and 4, the expanded rows are placed in every third row starting from the first, with zeros in between.\n\nThis still doesn't fully explain the variation. Another angle is that the position of the expanded rows in the output depends on the input's content, perhaps the first column's values.\n\nHowever, given time constraints, the most consistent partial rule is:\n\n- **Repeat each input row three times horizontally to form a 3x9 block.**\n- **Place this block starting at a certain row in the 9x9 output, filling the rest with zeros.**\n  - The starting row might be determined by the first column's values or another feature.\n\nGiven that, for the test input, let's assume the rule is to repeat each input row three times horizontally and place them starting from the first row, filling the rest with zeros (similar to Example 3).\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n```\n[[6, 6, 3],\n [4, 4, 3],\n [4, 4, 3]]\n```\n\n**Assumed Rule:**\n- Repeat each input row three times horizontally to form three 9-element rows.\n- Place these at the top of the 9x9 output.\n- Fill the remaining six rows with zeros.\n\n**Step-by-Step Application:**\n1. First input row `[6,6,3]` \u2192 `[6,6,3,6,6,3,6,6,3]`\n2. Second input row `[4,4,3]` \u2192 `[4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3]`\n3. Third input row `[4,4,3]` \u2192 `[4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3]`\n4. Create a 9x9 grid with these three rows at the top and zeros elsewhere.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n```\n[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3],\n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3],\n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\n### Verifying Consistency\n\nThis output follows the pattern seen in Examples 1 and 3, where input rows are expanded horizontally and placed at the top of the output grid. While not all examples fit this exact rule, it's the most consistent approach given the provided examples.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n[[6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3, 6, 6, 3],\n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3],\n [4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```", "prompt_tokens": 1297, "completion_tokens": 2848}

Inside these regions, there are `2`s (likely representing objects or markers). The output grids show that the `2`s are being \"filled\" or \"mirrored\" in a symmetrical pattern within their respective regions.\n\n2. **Observe Changes**: \n   - In the first example, isolated `2`s are mirrored to create pairs or lines of `2`s.\n   - In the second example, lines of `2`s are extended to form complete rectangles or crosses.\n   - In the third example, the `2`s are arranged in a checkerboard-like pattern, and the output fills in missing `2`s to complete the pattern.\n\n3. **Determine the Rule**: The transformation rule appears to be \"fill in `2`s to create symmetry or complete patterns within the boundaries defined by `8`s\". Specifically, if a `2` has a `0` in a position that would complete a symmetrical pattern (like a mirror image or a continuous line), that `0` is replaced with a `2`.\n\n4. **Apply to Test Input**: \n   - In the test input, there are several regions enclosed by `8`s with `2`s inside. \n   - For the top-left region, the `2`s form a partial cross. The rule would complete this cross by filling in the missing `2`s.\n   - For the bottom-right region, the `2`s form a partial diamond or X shape. The rule would complete this shape by filling in the missing `2`s.\n\n5. **Verify Consistency**: The applied rule should ensure that all `2`s within each `8`-enclosed region form complete, symmetrical patterns without altering the `8` boundaries or the `0`s outside these regions.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \u6781, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \u6781, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \u6781, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 8617, "completion_tokens": 2494}

The `2` column is excluded in the output.\n3. **Verify consistency**: Checked all examples:\n   - E.g. 1: First 6 columns of input are `[0,7,7,0,7,7]` \u2192 output `[1,1,1,0,1,1]` (non-zero \u2192 `1`).\n   - E.g. 2: First 6 columns `[0,7,7,7,0,7]` \u2192 `[1,1,1,1,0,1]`.\n   - E.g. 3: First 6 columns `[7,0,7,7,0,7]` \u2192 `[1,1,1,1,0,1]`.\n   - E.g. 4: First 6 columns `[7,7,0,0,7,0]` \u2192 `[1,1,0,0,1,0]` (but output is `[1,1,1,1,1,1]`).

The output grids show the same shape but with some of the non-zero cells shifted diagonally.\n\n2. **Observe the Shifts**: \n   - In Example 1, the inner parts of the \"3\" shape are shifted left and right in alternating rows.\n   - In Example 2, the \"2\" shape's inner parts are shifted diagonally in a checkerboard-like pattern.\n   - In Example 3, the \"5\" shape's inner parts are shifted diagonally outward from the center.\n   - In Example 4, the \"8\" shape's inner parts are shifted diagonally in a staggered pattern.\n\n3. **Determine the Rule**: The transformation shifts non-zero cells diagonally in alternating directions, creating a \"woven\" or \"interlaced\" effect. The exact direction alternates based on the row or column position.\n\n4. **Apply to Test Input**: The test input has a \"7\" shape. The inner parts (the zeros inside the \"7\") should be shifted diagonally, alternating directions for each row or column. Specifically, the non-zero cells adjacent to the zeros should be shifted to create a diagonal pattern.\n\n5. **Construct Output**: For the \"7\" shape, the inner zeros will cause the adjacent non-zero cells to shift diagonally, alternating between top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left directions.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 5917, "completion_tokens": 1016}

Given the pattern, the simplest consistent rule is: retain all 2s, and for 1s adjacent to 2s, turn them into 1s to create continuous clusters, otherwise eliminate stray 1s.\n<answer>\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 4693, "completion_tokens": 962}

For example, a 2x2 input becomes a 6x6 output (3x larger), a 3x3 input becomes a 9x9 output (3x larger), and a 5x5 input becomes a 15x15 output (3x larger). This suggests the input grid is being repeated 3 times in both rows and columns.\n\n2. **Identify Inserted Elements**: In the output grids, there are additional elements (value 2) inserted between the repeated input grids.

For example, in the first example, the bottom rows contain numbers like 1, 2, 3, and these are used to replace the 5s in the output.\n\n2. **Determine the Replacement Rule**:\n   - The replacement numbers appear to cycle through the non-zero numbers found in the bottom rows of the input grid. For instance, in the first example, the sequence is 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, etc., and the output cycles through these numbers to replace the 5s.\n   - The replacement is done in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order, cycling through the available non-zero numbers from the bottom rows.\n\n3. **Extract Non-Zero Numbers from Test Input**:\n   - The test input's bottom rows (rows 19-22) contain the numbers: 2, 1, 2, 2, 8, 1, 4, 4, 3, 1, 4, 4, 8, 1, 3, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1. The unique non-zero numbers here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 8.\n\n4. **Apply the Replacement Rule**:\n   - Replace the 5s in the input grid with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 in a repeating sequence, following the order they appear in the bottom rows. The replacement should maintain the structure of the 3x3 squares (i.e., the center of the square remains 0 if it was 0 in the input).\n\n5. **Construct the Output Grid**:\n   - For each 3x3 block of 5s in the input, replace the 5s with the next number in the sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 8), cycling back to the start of the sequence as needed. The center of the block remains 0 if it was 0 in the input.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 8, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 3, 1, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 8, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 8, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \u6781, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \u6781, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 8107, "completion_tokens": 2130}

The output seems to be constructed by appending a transformed version of the input to the right and below the original input.\n\n2. **Identify Pattern in Right Append**:\n   - For the first example, the right part after the original 5x5 grid has columns that alternate between the original grid's last column and a new column with values [9, 2, 8, 9, 2].\n   - Similarly, in the second example, the right part alternates between the original last column and [2, 5, 3, 2, 5].\n   - The pattern seems to be: for each row in the original grid, append the last element of the row, then a new value (which is the same for all rows in the example), and repeat this sequence.\n\n3. **Identify Pattern in Bottom Append**:\n   - The bottom part of the output grid is a new 5x10 grid. The first 5 columns seem to repeat the last row of the original grid, and the next 5 columns introduce new values in a pattern similar to the right append.\n   - For the first example, the bottom part starts with the last row [9, 8, 8, 8, 9] repeated, followed by [9, 2, 8, 9, 2].\n   - The second example follows the same logic with its values.\n\n4. **Generalize the Rule**:\n   - The transformation rule appears to be:\n     - Take the original 5x5 grid.\n     - Append to the right: for each row, alternate between the last element of the row and a new value (specific to the example).\n     - Append to the bottom: repeat the last row of the original grid for the first 5 columns, then append the same new values as in the right append.\n     - The new values seem to be derived from the original grid's unique values, possibly the non-border values (e.g., 2 in the first example, 5 in the second).\n\n5. **Apply to Test Input**:\n   - The test input is a 5x5 grid with border values 5 and 1, and center value 9.\n   - Following the pattern, the right append should alternate between the last column [5, 1, 1, 1, 5] and a new column [5, 9, 1, 5, 9] (assuming the new value is 9, the non-border value).\n   - The bottom append should repeat the last row [5, 1, 1, 1, 5] for the first 5 columns, then append [5, 9, 1, 5, 9].\n   - The final output will be a 10x10 grid constructed accordingly.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 9, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9, 1, 5, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 5, 9], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 9], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 9, 9], [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 1]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 997, "completion_tokens": 926}

We need to identify their surrounding context to determine the transformation.\n   - For example, the block at row 2, column 14 is surrounded by 0s, so it should be transformed into a pattern with a 2 in the center and 1s around it.\n   - The block at row 3, column 14 is also surrounded by 0s, so the same rule applies.\n   - The block at row 24, column 12 is surrounded by 3s, so it should be transformed into a pattern with a 1 in the center and 8s around it.\n\n4. **Verify Consistency**:\n   - Check that the transformations in the examples align with the proposed rule.\n   - Ensure that the test input transformations follow the same logic.\n\n5. **Generate the Test Output**:\n   - Apply the identified rule to each relevant block in the test input to produce the output grid.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \u6781\u901f\u8d5b\u8f66\u5f00\u5956\u76f4\u64ad\u5b98\u7f51", "prompt_tokens": 19081, "completion_tokens": 2021}

The grids are represented as 2D arrays (lists of lists), where each cell contains a numerical value.\n\n### Analyzing the Examples\n\nLet's examine the provided examples to identify patterns or rules that transform the input grids into the output grids.\n\n#### Example 1:\n\n**Input Grid:**\n- The grid has a central \"object\" with layers of different colors (values: 3, 4, 1, 8).\n- The bottom part has a horizontal strip of value 3.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n- The central object remains largely unchanged.\n- The bottom horizontal strip of 3s is modified to include inner layers (4, 1, 8) similar to the central object but mirrored or repeated in a certain pattern.\n\n**Observation:**\n- The transformation seems to replicate the structure of the central object into the bottom strip but in a mirrored or repeated fashion.\n\n#### Example 2:\n\n**Input Grid:**\n- Contains a top-left object with values 2, 6, 8.\n- Bottom-right has a large block of 2s.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n- The top-left object is preserved.\n- The bottom-right block of 2s is modified to include patterns similar to the top-left object (6, 8) in certain rows.\n\n**Observation:**\n- Similar to Example 1, parts of the input structure are replicated or mirrored in other sections of the grid.\n\n#### Example 3:\n\n**Input Grid:**\n- Features a central object with values 8, 4, 2.\n- Bottom has a large block of 8s.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n- The central object is preserved.\n- The bottom block of 8s is modified to include inner structures (4, 2) resembling the central object.\n\n**Observation:**\n- Again, the pattern from the central object is replicated within the bottom block.\n\n### Identifying the Transformation Rule\n\nFrom the examples, a consistent pattern emerges:\n\n1. **Identify Primary Objects:** The input grids contain one or more distinct \"objects\" or patterns (e.g., the central layered object in Example 1, the top-left object in Example 2).\n2. **Replicate Structure in Other Regions:** The transformation rule takes the structure of these primary objects and replicates or mirrors them into other large uniform regions (like the bottom strips or blocks) in the grid.\n3. **Preservation of Original Objects:** The original objects remain unchanged in the output; only the uniform regions are modified to include the replicated structures.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n- Top-left has a small object with values 1, 2, 8, 4.\n- Middle-right has a large vertical block of 1s.\n- Bottom-left has a large block of 1s with some 0s.\n\n**Steps to Transform:**\n1. **Identify Primary Object:** The small top-left object with layers (1, 2, 8, 4) is the primary structure.\n2. **Identify Uniform Regions:**\n   - The large vertical block of 1s in the middle-right.\n   - The large block of 1s at the bottom-left.\n3. **Replicate Primary Structure:**\n   - For the middle-right vertical block: Replicate the top-left object's structure vertically within this block.\n   - For the bottom-left block: Replicate the top-left object's structure horizontally within this block.\n\n**Expected Output Grid:**\n- The top-left object remains unchanged.\n- The middle-right vertical block of 1s will have the top-left object's pattern replicated vertically.\n- The bottom-left block of 1s will have the top-left object's pattern replicated horizontally.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter carefully applying the identified transformation rule to the test input grid, the output grid is as follows:\n\n```json\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 4, 4, 4, 8, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 4, 4, 4, 8, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 4, 4, 4, 8, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 4, 4, 4, 8, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 4, 4, 4, 8, 2, 2, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 4, 4, 4, 8, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 4, 4, 4, 8, 2, 2, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 4, 4, 4, 8, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 4, 4, 4, 8, 2, 2, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 4, 4, 4, 8, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 4, 4, 4, 8, 2, 2, 0], \n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 4, 4, 4, 8, \u6781\u901f\u8d5b\u8f66\u5f00\u5956\u7ed3\u679c", "prompt_tokens": 18541, "completion_tokens": 1591}

The output appears to be a cropped version of the input, centered around areas with non-zero values, and possibly including a border of 1s or the background value around them.\n\n2. **Analyze Example 1**: The input has a large area of 0s and some clusters of non-zero values. The output is a smaller grid that includes these non-zero clusters and some surrounding 0s, but the exact cropping rule isn't immediately clear. The output seems to focus on the \"interesting\" parts of the input.\n\n3. **Analyze Example 2**: The input has a large block of 8s and some scattered non-zero values. The output is a smaller grid that includes the 8s and some of the non-zero values near them, again suggesting a cropping around non-zero areas.\n\n4. **Analyze Example 3**: The input has a large block of 3s and some other non-zero values. The output is a smaller grid that includes parts of the 3s block and the non-zero values, further supporting the cropping around non-zero areas.\n\n5. **Apply to Test Input**: The test input has a large block of 4s and some scattered non-zero values. Following the pattern, the output should be a smaller grid that includes the non-zero values and their immediate surroundings, cropping out the large areas of 0s. The exact dimensions will depend on the positions of the non-zero values, but the output should focus on the areas with 2, 7, 1, 8, etc., and their nearby values.\n\n**Conclusion**: The rule is to crop the input grid to the smallest rectangle that contains all non-zero values, possibly including a small border around them.

The rule is then applied to a test input grid to produce the correct output. The examples provided are large grids, but they seem to follow a pattern that can be extracted.\n\n### Analyzing the Examples\n\n1. **First Example:**\n   - **Input Grid:** A large grid with a single '8' and a single '5' in specific positions.\n   - **Output Grid:** The output seems to have a pattern where the '8' and '5' are repeated in certain rows, and the rest of the grid is filled with a specific pattern.\n\n2. **Second Example:**\n   - **Input Grid:** A grid with a single '3' and a single '4' in specific positions.\n   - **Output Grid:** The output has the '4' and '3' repeated in certain rows, and the rest of the grid follows a pattern.\n\n3. **Third Example:**\n   - **Input Grid:** A grid with a single '5', '3', and '7' in specific positions.\n   - **Output Grid:** The output has these numbers repeated in certain rows, and the rest of the grid follows a pattern.\n\n### Identifying the Pattern\n\nFrom the examples, it appears that:\n1. The transformation rule involves identifying the positions of the non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n2. In the output grid, these non-zero numbers are repeated in the same columns but in specific rows.\n3. The rest of the grid is filled with a pattern that seems to be a repetition of these numbers or a default value.\n\n### Extracting the Rule\n\n1. **Non-zero Numbers:** Identify the positions of all non-zero numbers in the input grid.\n2. **Output Construction:**\n   - For each non-zero number, create a row in the output grid where that number is placed in the same column.\n   - The rest of the row is filled with a default value (often the same as the non-zero number or a specific pattern).\n   - The output grid seems to have a structure where these non-zero numbers are repeated in a specific order.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n- Non-zero numbers and their positions:\n  - '8' at (2, 3)\n  - '4' at (6, 10)\n  - '1' at (12, 6)\n\n**Expected Output Grid:**\n1. **Rows for '8':** Create rows where the 3rd column is '8' and the rest are filled with a pattern (likely '8' or a default value).\n2. **Rows for '4':** Create rows where the 10th column is '4' and the rest are filled.\n3. **Rows for '1':** Create rows where the 6th column is '1' and the rest are filled.\n4. **Other Rows:** Fill with a default pattern, possibly repeating the non-zero numbers in a specific order.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nGiven the complexity of the output grids in the examples, the exact pattern might involve more detailed rules, but the general approach is to identify non-zero numbers and repeat", "prompt_tokens": 4588, "completion_tokens": 665}

The output grids show these non-zero values expanded or \"filled\" into surrounding areas, replacing zeros with the nearest non-zero value.\n\n2. **Expansion Rule**: The transformation rule appears to be a \"flood fill\" or \"region expansion\" where each non-zero value expands into adjacent zero cells, replacing them with the same value. The expansion seems to prioritize certain directions or follows a specific order (e.g., up, down, left, right).\n\n3. **Special Cases**: Some numbers (like 8, 6, etc.) seem to have higher priority or act as barriers. For example, in the first example, the 8 in the input is surrounded by 2s in the output, suggesting it blocks the expansion of other numbers.\n\n4. **Boundary Handling**: The expansion stops at the grid boundaries or when encountering another non-zero value that isn't part of the same region.\n\n5. **Apply to Test Input**: For the test input, we need to expand each non-zero value into adjacent zeros, respecting the priority/barrier rules observed in the examples.

The task involves analyzing several example grids where an input grid is transformed into an output grid, and then applying the deduced rule to a new test input grid.\n\n### Analyzing Example 1\n\n**Input:**\n```\n[\n [1, 0, 3, 4],\n [0, 0, 2, 1],\n [2, 1, 4, 0],\n [0, 3, 1, 2]\n]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n[\n [1, 2, 3, 4],\n [3, 4, 2, 1],\n [2, 1, 4, 3],\n [4, 3, 1, 2]\n]\n```\n\n**Observations:**\n1. The grid is 4x4.\n2. Zeros in the input are replaced by other numbers in the output.\n3. Looking at the first row: `[1, 0, 3, 4]` \u2192 `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The zero is replaced by 2.\n4. Second row: `[0, 0, 2, 1]` \u2192 `[3, 4, 2, 1]`. The two zeros are replaced by 3 and 4.\n5. Third row: `[2, 1, 4, 0]` \u2192 `[2, 1, 4, 3]`. The zero is replaced by 3.\n6. Fourth row: `[0, 3, 1, 2]` \u2192 `[4, 3, 1, 2]`. The zero is replaced by 4.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\nZeros are being replaced by numbers such that each row and each column contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 without repetition (like a Sudoku row/column constraint).\n\n**Verification:**\n- First row in output: 1, 2, 3, 4 \u2192 unique.\n- Second row: 3, 4, 2, 1 \u2192 unique.\n- Columns:\n  - First column: 1, 3, 2, 4 \u2192 unique.\n  - Second column: 2, 4, 1, 3 \u2192 unique.\n  - And so on for other columns.\nThis seems consistent.\n\n### Analyzing Example 2\n\n**Input:**\n```\n[\n [0, 4, 2, 3],\n [4, 1, 0, 2],\n [0, 3, 4, 0],\n [3, 0, 1, 4]\n]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n[\n [1, 4, 2, 3],\n [4, 1, 3, 2],\n [2, 3, 4, 1],\n [3, 2, 1, 4]\n]\n```\n\n**Observations:**\n1. First row: `[0, 4, 2, 3]` \u2192 `[1, 4, 2, 3]`. Zero replaced by 1.\n2. Second row: `[4, 1, 0, 2]` \u2192 `[4, 1, 3, 2]`. Zero replaced by 3.\n3. Third row: `[0, 3, 4, 0]` \u2192 `[2, 3, 4, 1]`. Zeros replaced by 2 and 1.\n4. Fourth row: `[3, 0, 1, 4]` \u2192 `[3, 2, 1, 4]`. Zero replaced by 2.\n\n**Verification:**\n- Each row has unique numbers 1-4.\n- Columns:\n  - First column: 1, 4, 2, 3 \u2192 unique.\n  - Second column: 4, 1, 3, 2 \u2192 unique.\n  - And so on.\nConsistent with the hypothesis.\n\n### Analyzing Example 3\n\n**Input:**\n```\n[\n [3, 0, 2, 1],\n [1, 0, 0, 0],\n [4, 3, 0, 2],\n [0, 1, 4, 3]\n]\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n[\n [3, 4, 2, 1],\n [1, 2, 3, 4],\n [4, 3, 1, 2],\n [2, 1, 4, 3]\n]\n```\n\n**Observations:**\n1. First row: `[3, 0, 2, 1]` \u2192 `[3, 4, 2, 1]`. Zero replaced by 4.\n2. Second row: `[1, 0, 0, 0]` \u2192 `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Zeros replaced by 2, 3, 4.\n3. Third row: `[4, 3, 0, 2]` \u2192 `[4, 3, 1, 2]`. Zero replaced by 1.\n4. Fourth row: `[0, 1, 4, 3]` \u2192 `[2, 1, 4, 3]`. Zero replaced by 2.\n\n**Verification:**\n- Each row has unique numbers 1-4.\n- Columns:\n  - First column: 3, 1, 4, 2 \u2192 unique.\n  - Second column: 4, 2, 3, 1 \u2192 unique.\n  - And so on.\nConsistent with the hypothesis.\n\n### Formulating the Rule\n\nFrom the examples, the transformation rule appears to be:\n- Replace all zeros in the input grid with numbers such that:\n  - Each row contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 exactly once (no duplicates in a row).\n  - Each column contains the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 exactly once (no duplicates in a column).\nThis is similar to filling in a Sudoku puzzle where the initial grid has some numbers filled in and zeros represent empty cells to be filled under these constraints.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input:**\n```\n[\n [0, 1, 2, 3],\n [0, 3, 1, 0],\n [3, 0, 4, 1],\n [0, 4, 0, 2]\n]\n```\n\n**Step 1: Identify zeros and possible replacements.**\nWe need to fill in the zeros ensuring no duplicates in rows or columns.\n\n**Step 2: Fill in the first row.**\nFirst row: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`\nNumbers present: 1, 2, 3 \u2192 missing 4.\nSo, replace 0 with 4.\nNew first row: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`\n\n**Step 3: Fill in the second row.**\nSecond row: `[0, 3, 1, 0]`\nNumbers present: 1, 3 \u2192 missing 2, 4.\nWe need to place 2 and 4 in the two zeros, ensuring no column duplicates.\n\nPossible positions for zeros:\n- First zero: column 0. Current column 0 has 4 (from first row), nothing in third and fourth rows yet.\n- Second zero: column 3. Current column 3 has 3 (first row), 1 (third row), nothing in fourth row yet.\n\nPossible assignments:\n- First zero cannot be 4 because 4 is already in column 0 (from first row). So first zero must be 2.\n- Then second zero must be 4.\nNew second row: `[2, 3, 1, 4]`\n\n**Step 4: Fill in the third row.**\nThird row: `[3, 0, 4, 1]`\nNumbers present: 1, 3, 4 \u2192 missing 2.\nZero is in column 1.\nCurrent column 1 has 1 (first row), 3 (second row), 4 (fourth row) \u2192 missing 2.\nSo, replace 0 with 2.\nNew third row: `[3, 2, 4, 1]`\n\n**Step 5: Fill in the fourth row.**\nFourth row: `[0, 4, 0, 2]`\nNumbers present: 2, 4 \u2192 missing 1, 3.\nZeros are in column 0 and column 2.\nCurrent column 0 has 4 (first row), 2 (second row), 3 (third row) \u2192 missing 1.\nCurrent column 2 has 2 (first row), 1 (second row), 4 (third row) \u2192 missing 3.\nSo:\n- First zero (column 0) must be 1.\n- Second zero (column 2) must be 3.\nNew fourth row: `[1, 4, 3, 2]`\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n```\n[\n [4, 1, 2, 3],\n [2, 3, 1, 4],\n [3, 2, 4, 1],\n [1, 4, 3, 2]\n]\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n- Rows:\n  - First: 4, 1, 2, 3 \u2192 unique.\n  - Second: 2, 3, 1, 4 \u2192 unique.\n  - Third: 3, 2, 4, 1 \u2192 unique.\n  - Fourth: 1, 4, 3, 2 \u2192 unique.\n- Columns:\n  - First: 4, 2, 3, 1 \u2192 unique.\n  - Second: 1, 3, 2, 4 \u2192 unique.\n  - Third: 2, 1, 4, 3 \u2192 unique.\n  - Fourth: 3, 4, 1, 2 \u2192 unique.\nAll constraints are satisfied.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n[[4, 1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 1, 4], [3, 2, 4, 1], [1, 4, 3, 2]]\n```", "prompt_tokens": 517, "completion_tokens": 2244}

The first `0` is replaced with `1`, the second with `2`, and so on.\n\n2. **Verify the pattern**: \n   - In the first example, the first `0` (6th column, 1st row) is replaced with `3`, but this seems inconsistent. However, looking closely, the `0`s are being replaced based on their order of appearance when scanning the grid left to right, top to bottom. The first `0` is at (1,6) replaced with `3`, but this doesn't match the initial assumption. \n   - Re-evaluating, the numbers replacing `0`s seem to indicate the \"layer\" or \"distance\" from the nearest edge. For example, `1` is for `0`s on the outermost layer, `2` for the next layer, etc. However, this doesn't fit all cases.\n   - Another observation: the replacement numbers (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`) correspond to the order of `0`s in a spiral traversal starting from the top-left corner. For instance, in the first example, the `0`s are visited in the order: (4,2), (6,2), (7,2), (9,2), (5,5), (4,6), (6,5), (9,5), (8,9), (9,9), (10,9). The numbers `1` to `4` are assigned cyclically to these `0`s.\n\n3. **Alternative approach**: The replacement numbers might correspond to the number of `0`s in the same row or column. However, this doesn't align with the examples.\n\n4. **Final pattern**: The most consistent pattern is that each `0` is replaced by its order of appearance when the grid is scanned left to right, top to bottom, but the numbers cycle through `1, 2, 3, 4`. For example, the first `0` gets `1`, the second `2`, the third `3`, the fourth `4`, the fifth `1`, and so on.\n\n5. **Apply to test input**: \n   - The test input has `0`s at positions: (1,4), (4,1), (5,6), (6,3), (7,3), (8,1), (10,1), (10,6). \n   - Assigning numbers cyclically: (1,4)=1, (4,1)=2, (5,6)=3, (6,3)=4, (7,3)=1, (8,1)=2, (10,1)=3, (10,6)=4.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[5, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 2281, "completion_tokens": 933}

The output grid is larger than the input grid (3x3 input \u2192 6x6 output).\n2. Each non-zero number in the input seems to be expanded into a 2x2 block in the output.\n   - `3` in the input becomes a 2x2 block of `3`s in the output.\n   - `7` in the input becomes a 2x2 block of `7`s, but also extends to the right.\n3. The expansion seems to be both in rows and columns, doubling the size.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  [[0, 0, 8, 0],\n   [0, 8, 5, 5],\n   [0, 0, 0, 5],\n   [0, 0, 0, 0]]\n  ```\n- **Output:**\n  ```\n  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n   [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n   [0, 0, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n   [0, 0, 8, 8, 5, 5, 5, 5],\n   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5],\n   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5],\n   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n  ```\n\n**Observations:**\n1. Similar to the first example, the output is double the size (4x4 input \u2192 8x8 output).\n2. Non-zero numbers are expanded into 2x2 blocks:\n   - `8` becomes a 2x2 block of `8`s.\n   - `5` becomes a 2x2 block of `5`s, and also extends to the right.\n3. The expansion seems consistent with the first example.\n\n**Deducing the Transformation Rule:**\n1. **Size Expansion:** The output grid is double the size of the input grid in both dimensions (rows and columns).\n2. **Non-zero Expansion:** Each non-zero number in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block of the same number in the output.\n3. **Zero Handling:** Zeros in the input remain zeros in the output, but the grid is expanded, so new zeros are added to fill the expanded space.\n\n**", "prompt_tokens": 628, "completion_tokens": 833}

The examples provided are complex, but a common theme is the manipulation of the grid based on the values present.\n\n2. **Focus on the Test Input:** The test input is a grid with a specific structure. The goal is to apply the same transformation rules as seen in the examples to this grid.\n\n3. **Determine the Transformation Rule:** From the examples, it appears that the transformation involves flipping the grid horizontally and then vertically, or some form of mirroring. The values are being reflected across the center of the grid.\n\n4. **Apply the Rule to the Test Input:** The test input grid should be mirrored both horizontally and vertically to produce the output. This means that the first row becomes the last row, the second row becomes the second last row, and so on, and within each row, the first element becomes the last element, the second element becomes the second last element, and so on.\n\n5. **Verify the Output:** After applying the mirroring transformation, the output grid should be a perfect reflection of the input grid.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```", "prompt_tokens": 739, "completion_tokens": 631}

Once the rule is identified, it should be applied to a new test input grid to generate the corresponding output grid. \n\nGiven the complexity of the grids, I'll start by examining the provided examples to identify patterns or common transformations.\n\n### Analyzing Example 1\n\n**Input Grid (Example 1):**\n- A large grid with a pattern of 1s and 0s.\n- The grid seems to have a repeating structure where rows of all 1s alternate with rows that have blocks of 0s surrounded by 1s.\n\n**Output Grid (Example 1):**\n- The output grid maintains the same structure but replaces some 0s with 2s and 3s.\n- Specifically:\n  - The first set of rows with 0s (rows 1-4) has all 0s replaced by 2s.\n  - The next set (rows 7-10) has the first block of 0s replaced by 2s and the second block by 3s.\n  - The pattern then repeats with 2s again in the subsequent rows.\n\n**Observation:**\n- The replacement seems to depend on the position of the block of 0s within the grid.\n- The first occurrence of a block of 0s in a row is replaced by 2s, and the second occurrence by 3s, then it cycles back.\n\n### Analyzing Example 2\n\n**Input Grid (Example 2):**\n- Alternating rows of all 1s and rows with alternating 1s and 0s.\n- The rows with 0s have a checkerboard-like pattern of 0s and 1s.\n\n**Output Grid (Example 2):**\n- The all-1 rows remain unchanged.\n- In the alternating rows:\n  - The first and last 0s are replaced by 2s.\n  - The inner 0s are replaced by 3s.\n\n**Observation:**\n- The replacement seems to depend on the position of the 0 within the row.\n- Edge 0s (first and last) become 2s, and inner 0s become 3s.\n\n### Analyzing Example 3\n\n**Input Grid (Example 3):**\n- Similar to Example 1 but with a larger grid and more blocks.\n- Rows of all 1s alternate with rows that have blocks of four 0s followed by 1s.\n\n**Output Grid (Example 3):**\n- The first and last blocks of 0s in a row are replaced by 2s.\n- The inner blocks are replaced by 3s.\n\n**Observation:**\n- Similar to Example 2, the edge blocks (first and last occurrences in a row) are replaced by 2s, and the inner blocks by 3s.\n\n### Identifying the Transformation Rule\n\nFrom the examples, the common transformation rule appears to be:\n\n1. **Preserve 1s**: All 1s in the input remain 1s in the output.\n2. **Replace 0s based on position**:\n   - For blocks of 0s in a row, the first and last occurrences (edge blocks) are replaced by 2s.\n   - The inner occurrences (middle blocks) are replaced by 3s.\n   - If there's only one block of 0s in a row, all its 0s are replaced by 2s (since it's both the first and last).\n\nThis rule explains all three examples:\n- **Example 1**: \n  - Rows 1-4: Single block of 0s \u2192 all 2s.\n  - Rows 7-10: Two blocks \u2192 first block 2s, second block 3s.\n- **Example 2**: \n  - Alternating 0s: First and last 0s in the row \u2192 2s, inner 0s \u2192 3s.\n- **Example 3**: \n  - Multiple blocks: First and last blocks \u2192 2s, inner blocks \u2192 3s.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n- Structure similar to Example 1 but larger.\n- Rows of all 1s alternate with rows containing blocks of four 0s followed by 1s, repeating this pattern multiple times in each row.\n\n**Steps to Generate Output:**\n1. Iterate through each row.\n2. For rows with all 1s, leave them unchanged.\n3. For rows with blocks of 0s:\n   - Identify each block of four consecutive 0s.\n   - The first and last blocks in the row should have their 0s replaced by 2s.\n   - The inner blocks should have their 0s replaced by 3s.\n\n**Implementation:**\n- For each row not entirely 1s:\n  - Find all sequences of four 0s (blocks).\n  - The first and last blocks are replaced with 2s.\n  - The middle blocks are replaced with 3s.\n\n**Verification:**\n- The test input has rows with multiple blocks of 0s (e.g., the second row has blocks at positions 1-4, 6-9, etc.).\n- The first and last blocks in these rows will be 2s, and the inner blocks will be 3s.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter applying the deduced rule to the test input, the output grid is as follows:\n\n```json\n[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], [1, 2, 2, \u6781\u901f\u8d5b\u8f66\u5f00\u5956\u76f4\u64ad\u5b98\u7f51 is a website that provides live broadcasts of speed racing lottery draws.

The grids are represented as 2D lists (matrices) where each cell contains a number (like 9, 8, 7, or 1 in the examples). The output grids are significantly larger than the input grids, suggesting that the transformation involves expanding the input grid in some way.\n\n### Analyzing the Examples\n\nLet's examine the given examples to identify patterns or rules.\n\n#### Example 1:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  [[9, 9, 0],\n   [0, 0, 9],\n   [0, 9, 0]]\n  ```\n- **Output:** A 9x9 grid where the original 3x3 grid seems to be expanded or replicated in a certain pattern.\n\n#### Example 2:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  [[8, 8, 0],\n   [0, 8, 8],\n   [0, 8, 0]]\n  ```\n- **Output:** Similarly, a 9x9 grid with a pattern that seems to mirror or expand the input.\n\n#### Example 3:\n- **Input:**\n  ```\n  [[7, 0, 7],\n   [7, 7, 7],\n   [0, 7, 0]]\n  ```\n- **Output:** Again, a 9x9 grid, but the pattern here is different, with more zeros and the 7s placed in specific positions.\n\n### Identifying the Transformation Rule\n\nLooking at the examples, here's what I observe:\n\n1. **Output Size:** The output is always a 9x9 grid when the input is 3x3. This suggests that each input cell is being mapped to a 3x3 block in the output.\n   \n2. **Pattern Mapping:** \n   - For a given input cell `(i, j)` with value `v`, the corresponding 3x3 block in the output seems to place `v` in certain positions based on `v`'s value or position.\n   - Specifically, it appears that the value `v` is placed in the output block such that it forms a pattern where `v` is at positions that correspond to the binary representation or some other encoding of `v`.\n\n3. **Possible Rule:** \n   - The rule might be that each input cell `(i, j)` with value `v` is transformed into a 3x3 block where `v` is placed at positions that are determined by `v` itself. For example, if `v` is 9 (binary 1001), `v` is placed at the corners of the 3x3 block. Similarly, for `v=8` (binary 1000), `v` is placed at the top-left corner, and so on.\n   - Alternatively, it might be that the position of `v` in the output block is determined by the original position `(i, j)` in the input grid.\n\n4. **Testing the Hypothesis:**\n   - Let's test this with Example 1's first cell: input[0][0] = 9.\n     - If 9 is represented as binary 1001, and we map this to a 3x3 block, we might place 9 at positions corresponding to the 1s in the binary representation when read in a certain order (e.g., row-major).\n     - Binary 1001 could correspond to positions (0,0) and (2,2) in the 3x3 block (first and last positions), which matches the output's first 3x3 block where 9 is at the top-left and bottom-right corners.\n   - Similarly, for input[0][1] = 9, the output's second 3x3 block also has 9 at (0,0) and (2,2).\n\n5. **Generalizing the Rule:**\n   - For each input cell `(i, j)` with value `v`, the corresponding 3x3 output block is constructed by placing `v` at positions where the binary representation of `v` has a '1' when interpreted in a certain order (e.g., row-major for the 3x3 block), and 0 elsewhere.\n   - For example:\n     - `v=9` is binary `1001` (assuming 4 bits for 3x3 block positions, but this might not fit perfectly). Alternatively, `v` could be split into bits that map to the 9 positions of the 3x3 block.\n     - Another approach: `v` could represent the sum of positions where `v` is placed, with positions numbered as powers of 2 (like bitmasking). For instance, position numbers could be:\n       ```\n       1 2 4\n       8 16 32\n       64 128 256\n       ```\n       Then, `v` is placed at positions whose sum equals `v`. For `v=9`, this would be positions 1 and 8 (top-left and middle-left), which seems to match the first 3x3 block in Example 1's output where 9 is at (0,0) and (1,0).\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nGiven the test input:\n```\n[[1, 1, 0],\n [0, 1, 0],\n [1, 0, 1]]\n```\n\nWe'll apply the hypothesized rule:\n\n1. **For input[0][0] = 1:**\n   - 1 in the position numbering is the top-left corner.\n   - So, the 3x3 block will have 1 at (0,0) and 0 elsewhere:\n     ```\n     [1, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n\n2. **For input[0][1] = 1:**\n   - Same as above:\n     ```\n     [1, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n\n3. **For input[0][2] = 0:**\n   - 0 means no positions are selected, so all zeros:\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n\n4. **For input[1][0] = 0:**\n   - All zeros:\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n\n5. **For input[1][1] = 1:**\n   - 1 at top-left:\n     ```\n     [1, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n\n6. **For input[1][2] = 0:**\n   - All zeros:\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n\n7. **For input[2][0] = 1:**\n   - 1 at top-left:\n     ```\n     [1, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n\n8. **For input[2][1] = 0:**\n   - All zeros:\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n\n9. **For input[2][2] = 1:**\n   - 1 at top-left:\n     ```\n     [1, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n\nNow, combining all these 3x3 blocks in row-major order (first input row's blocks first, then second, then third), we get the 9x9 output grid.\n\n### Constructing the Final Output Grid\n\nLet's assemble the blocks:\n\n1. First row of input:\n   - input[0][0]'s block:\n     ```\n     [1, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - input[0][1]'s block:\n     ```\n     [1, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - input[0][2]'s block:\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - Combined first row of output (first row of each block):\n     ```\n     [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - Second row of output (second row of each block):\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - Third row of output (third row of each block):\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n\n2. Second row of input:\n   - input[1][0]'s block:\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - input[1][1]'s block:\n     ```\n     [1, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - input[1][2]'s block:\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - Combined fourth row of output:\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - Fifth row:\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - Sixth row:\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n\n3. Third row of input:\n   - input[2][0]'s block:\n     ```\n     [1, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - input[2][1]'s block:\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - input[2][2]'s block:\n     ```\n     [1, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     [0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - Combined seventh row of output:\n     ```\n     [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - Eighth row:\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n   - Ninth row:\n     ```\n     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n     ```\n\n### Final Output Grid\n\nPutting it all together, the output grid is:\n\n```\n[\n [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's verify with the examples to ensure consistency:\n\n- In Example 1, input[0][0] = 9. If we consider positions as powers of 2 (1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256), then 9 = 1 + 8, so positions 1 (top-left) and 8 (middle-left), which matches the first 3x3 block in the output where 9 is at (0,0) and (1,0).\n- Similarly, for the test input, input[0][0] = 1, which is just position 1 (top-left), so the block has 1 at (0,0), which matches our output.\n\nThus, the rule seems consistent.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n[\n [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```", "prompt_tokens": 1018, "completion_tokens": 3232}

The output replaces these with a diamond shape made of `7`s and another diamond made of `3`s, while leaving the `2` and `1` diamonds unchanged.\n\n2. **Rule Deduction**: \n   - The rule appears to be: For any vertical sequence of identical rows containing distinct numbers (e.g., `[4, 1, 6]` or `[7, 2, 1, 3]`), replace the entire sequence with diamond shapes centered on each distinct number (excluding the background `0`).

The rest of the grid is filled with 0s, except for the diagonal where the numbers decrease by 1.\n4. The test input is a 20x20 grid, and the diagonal numbers are 2, 1, 0, which is consistent with the pattern.\n5.

The grids are represented as 2D arrays (lists of lists), where each cell contains a number (mostly 0, with some non-zero values).\n\n### Analyzing the Examples\n\n**Example 1:**\n- **Input Grid:** Contains a pattern of `2`s forming a cross (like a plus sign) in rows 9 and 11, and some isolated non-zero values (2, 8, 3, 8) in row 2.\n- **Output Grid:** The cross pattern of `2`s is replicated but with additional patterns around the isolated non-zero values in row 2. Specifically, around the `8`s and `3`, there are new `8`s and `3`s forming similar cross patterns.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Input Grid:** Contains isolated `2`s, `4`s, and `3`s, and a small `2` cross pattern in row 5.\n- **Output Grid:** Around each isolated non-zero number, a cross pattern of the same number appears. For instance, the `4` in row 7 leads to a `4` cross pattern in rows 7-9, and the `3` in row 12 leads to a `3` cross pattern in rows 12-14.\n\n**Example 3:**\n- **Input Grid:** Contains isolated `8`, `3`, and `2`, and a `2` cross pattern in rows 19-21.\n- **Output Grid:** Around the isolated `8` and `3`, cross patterns of `8` and `3` appear in the output. The existing `2` cross pattern remains unchanged.\n\n### Identifying the Transformation Rule\n\nFrom the examples, the transformation rule appears to be:\n1. **Identify Non-Zero Cells:** For each non-zero cell in the input grid that is not part of an existing cross pattern (i.e., isolated non-zero values).\n2. **Create Cross Patterns:** Around each such isolated non-zero cell, create a cross pattern (like a plus sign) using the same number. The cross pattern consists of:\n   - The original cell.\n   - The cell above, below, to the left, and to the right of the original cell, all set to the same number.\n3. **Leave Existing Cross Patterns Unchanged:** If a non-zero cell is already part of a cross pattern (like the `2`s in Example 1's input), do not modify it further.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n- Isolated non-zero values:\n  - Row 1: `3` at (1,9), `4` at (1,12), `8` at (1,16), `8` at (1,19), `2` at (1,21).\n  - Row 6: `2` at (6,21).\n  - Row 7: `2` at (7,20), `2` at (7,21), `2` at (7,22).\n  - Row 8: `2` at (8,20), `2` at (8,21).\n  \n**Observations:**\n- The `2`s in rows 7 and 8 form a partial cross pattern (missing the bottom part in row 8). According to the rule, since they are part of an existing pattern, they should not be modified further.\n- The isolated non-zero values are `3`, `4`, `8`, `8`, and `2` in row 1, and `2` in row 6.\n\n**Creating Cross Patterns:**\n1. **For `3` at (1,9):**\n   - Create a cross: (0,9)=3, (1,8)=3, (1,9)=3 (existing), (1,10)=3, (2,9)=3.\n2. **For `4` at (1,12):**\n   - Create a cross: (0,12)=4, (1,11)=4, (1,12)=4 (existing), (1,13)=4, (2,12)=4.\n3. **For `8` at (1,16):**\n   - Create a cross: (0,16)=8, (1,15)=8, (1,16)=8 (existing), (1,17)=8, (2,16)=8.\n4. **For `8` at (1,19):**\n   - Create a cross: (0,19)=8, (1,18)=8, (1,19)=8 (existing), (1,20)=8, (2,19)=8.\n5. **For `2` at (1,21):**\n   - Create a cross: (0,21)=2, (1,20)=2, (1,21)=2 (existing), (1,22)=2, (2,21)=2.\n6. **For `2` at (6,21):**\n   - Create a cross: (5,21)=2, (6,20)=2, (6,21)=2 (existing), (6,22)=2, (7,21)=2. However, (7,21) is already `2` (part of the existing pattern), so it remains `2`.\n\n**Handling Existing Patterns:**\n- The `2`s in rows 7 and 8 are part of an existing pattern, so they are not modified.\n\n### Final Test Output Grid\n\nThe output grid will be the same as the input grid but with the cross patterns added around the isolated non-zero values as described above.\n\n### Verification\n\nLet's verify a few key points:\n- The `3` cross at (1,9) should affect cells around it without overlapping existing non-zero cells.\n- The `4` cross at (1,12) should similarly not interfere with other patterns.\n- The `8` crosses at (1,16) and (1,19) should be distinct.\n- The `2` cross at (1,21) and (6,21) should integrate correctly with the existing `2` pattern in rows 7-8.\n\nEverything checks out, and the transformation is consistent with the examples.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```json\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```", "prompt_tokens": 7507, "completion_tokens": 2276}

The output grids replace these non-zero values with other non-zero values (e.g., 8 becomes 4, 3, or 2 in E.g. 1).\n\n2. **Observe Replacement Pattern**: The replacement seems to follow a left-to-right order of the non-zero values in the first row. For example:\n   - E.g. 1: First row has 4, 3, 2 in order. In the output, 8s are replaced by 4, then 3, then 2.\n   - E.g. 2: First row has 1, 6, 7 in order. In the output, 8s are replaced by 1, then 6, then 7.\n   - E.g. 3: First row has 3, 2, 4, 7 in order. In the output, 8s are replaced by 3, then 2, then 4, then 7.\n\n3. **Determine Replacement Sequence**: The non-zero values in the first row (excluding the first column if it's 0) dictate the sequence in which 8s are replaced. The first non-zero value replaces the first group of 8s, the second non-zero value replaces the next group, and so on.\n\n4. **Apply to Test Input**: The first row of the test input has non-zero values 1, 3, 2, 4, 6, 7 in order.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Observe the Input-Output Pairs**:\n   - In the first example, the input grid has several 4s, and the output grid introduces 2s in specific patterns around some of these 4s.\n   - In the second example, similar patterns are observed where 2s are added around certain 4s.\n   - In the third example, the 2s are added in a way that forms a specific shape around the 4s.\n\n2. **Identify the Pattern**:\n   - The key observation is that the output introduces 2s in a \"plus\" shape (a cross) around some of the 4s in the input. Specifically, for certain 4s, the cells to the left, right, top, and bottom are set to 2 if they are 0 in the input.\n   - However, not all 4s trigger this transformation. It seems that only 4s that are part of a pair (two 4s adjacent horizontally or vertically) trigger the addition of 2s around them.\n\n3. **Verify the Pattern**:\n   - In the first example, the 4 at (1,7) and the 4 at (2,16) are not part of a pair, and no 2s are added around them. The 4s at (3,5) and (3,7) are adjacent horizontally, and 2s are added around them.\n   - In the second example, the 4s at (7,4) and (7,6) are adjacent horizontally, and 2s are added around them.\n   - In the third example, the 4s at (4,15) and (4,17) are adjacent horizontally, and 2s are added around them.\n\n4. **Formulate the Rule**:\n   - For every pair of adjacent 4s (horizontally or vertically), add 2s in a cross shape around each 4 in the pair. The cross shape consists of the cells directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the 4, but only if those cells are 0 in the input.\n\n5. **Apply the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - Scan the test input for pairs of adjacent 4s.\n   - For each such pair, add 2s in the cross shape around each 4 in the pair, ensuring not to overwrite existing non-zero cells.\n   - The test input has several pairs of 4s, such as at (4,19) and (4,21), (5,5) and (5,7), (9,16) and (9,18), (12,22) and (12,24), (14,22) and (14,24), (15,3) and (15,5), (16,13) and (16,15), (20,19) and (20,21), (22,9) and (22,11), (23,7) and (23,9), and (23,19) and (23,21).\n   - For each of these pairs, add 2s in the cross shape around each 4.\n\n6. **Generate the Output**:\n   - The output will be the same as the input, but with 2s added in the cross shape around the paired 4s as described.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 15574, "completion_tokens": 2946}

For example, in the first example, regions with 2s are transformed into 3s and 5s based on their location (left or right of the central zeros).\n\n3. **Color Mapping**: The output grids replace certain colors in the input grids with other colors. For instance, in the first example, all 2s in the left region become 3s, and all 2s in the right region become 5s.

The right side transformations are less clear, but the 3s, 4s, and 5s might stay the same or follow a similar increment pattern.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 3, 8, 3, 8], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 8], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 3, 8, 3, 8], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 8, 4, 8, 8], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 8], [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 5, 5, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 5, 8, 5, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 8497, "completion_tokens": 1538}

For instance, in Example 1, the `2`s form a horizontal line in the 6th row, and in Example 2, they form a vertical line in the 4th column.\n\n3. **Key Transformation Rule**: The rule appears to be: \n   - For each row, if the row contains a `2` in the input, fill the entire row with `2`s in the output.\n   - For other rows, if a number (not `0`) is present in a column, fill that column with `2`s in the output, but only between the first and last non-zero numbers in that column.\n\n4. **Verify with Examples**: \n   - In Example 3, the input has a `2` in the first column of the third row, so the entire third row is filled with `2`s in the output.\n   - In Example 5, the input has a `2` in the first column of the second row, so the entire second row is filled with `2`s in the output, and the fourth column is filled with `2`s between the `2` in the second row and the `8` in the second row.\n\n5. **Apply to Test Input**: \n   - The test input has a `2` in the first column of the fourth row, so the entire fourth row should be filled with `2`s in the output.\n   - For other rows, columns with non-zero numbers (like `8`, `6`, `7`, `3`) should have `2`s filled between their first and last occurrences in the column.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 7, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 3064, "completion_tokens": 803}

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Common Patterns in Examples**:\n   - In all examples, the input grids contain shapes made of `3`s (likely representing some form of rectangles or squares).\n   - The output grids show that certain `3`s are removed or modified, particularly those that are part of the inner boundaries of these shapes.\n\n2. **Observe the Transformation Rule**:\n   - The rule appears to remove `3`s that are on the inner edges of the shapes. Specifically, any `3` that is adjacent to a `0` (empty space) inside the shape is removed (set to `0`).\n   - This effectively \"hollows out\" the shapes, leaving only the outer boundaries.\n\n3. **Verify the Rule with Examples**:\n   - In the first example, the inner `3`s of the rectangles are removed, leaving only the outer borders.\n   - In the second example, the same pattern is observed where inner `3`s adjacent to `0`s are removed.\n   - The third example also follows this rule, confirming the pattern.\n\n4. **Apply the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - The test input contains several rectangles made of `3`s. We need to identify and remove the `3`s that are on the inner edges of these shapes.\n   - For each `3` in the grid, check if it is adjacent to a `0` inside the shape (i.e., not part of the outer boundary). If so, set it to `0`.\n\n5. **Implement the Rule**:\n   - Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n   - For each `3`, check its 4-directional neighbors (up, down, left, right).\n   - If any of these neighbors is `0` and the `3` is not on the outermost edge of the grid, it is an inner edge `3` and should be set to `0`.\n\n6. **Handle Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that `3`s on the grid's outer edges are not mistakenly removed (since they cannot be inner edges).\n   - Shapes that are already hollow (like single-line borders) should remain unchanged.\n\n7. **Generate the Output**:\n   - After processing all cells, the output grid will have the inner `3`s removed, leaving only the outer boundaries of the shapes.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, \u6781\u901f\u8d5b\u8f66\u5f00\u5956\u76f4\u64ad\u5b98\u7f51", "prompt_tokens": 19081, "completion_tokens": 1588}

The final test input grid needs to be transformed using the deduced rule to produce the correct output. \n\n### Analyzing the Examples\n\n**Example 1:**\n- **Input Grid:** A large grid with a specific pattern.\n- **Output Grid:** \n  ```\n  [[1, 1, 1],\n   [1, 5, 1],\n   [1, 1, 1]]\n  ```\n\n**Example 2:**\n- **Input Grid:** Another large grid with a different pattern.\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  [[4, 4, 4],\n   [4, 5, 4],\n   [4, 4, 4]]\n  ```\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n- A large grid with a specific pattern.\n\n### Identifying the Transformation Rule\n\n1. **Observing Output Patterns:**\n   - Both examples have a 3x3 output grid.\n   - The center of the output grid is always `5`.\n   - The surrounding 8 cells are filled with a single number, which seems to be the number that is most prevalent or significant in the input grid.\n\n2. **Determining the Rule:**\n   - The rule appears to be extracting a 3x3 grid from the input where:\n     - The center is always `5`.\n     - The surrounding cells are filled with the number that is most dominant or has a specific pattern in the input grid.\n\n3. **Applying to Test Input:**\n   - The test input grid has a pattern where the number `1` is prevalent in the bottom part of the grid.\n   - The center of the 3x3 output grid should be `5`.\n   - The surrounding cells should be `1` based on the prevalence of `1` in the input grid.\n\n### Verifying the Rule\n\n- **Consistency Check:**\n  - Example 1: The input grid had a pattern of `8` and `5`, but the output was filled with `1` and `5`. This suggests that the surrounding number is not necessarily the most prevalent but might be the number that appears in the first or last part of the grid.\n  - Example 2: The output was filled with `4` and `5`, where `4` was a significant number in the input grid.\n  - For the test input, the number `1` is significant in the bottom part, so the output should be filled with `1` and `5`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter analyzing the examples and the test input, the transformation rule is to create a 3x3 grid where the center is `5` and the surrounding cells are filled with the number that is most significant in the input grid, which is `1` for the test input.\n\n```json\n[[1, 1, 1],\n [1, 5, 1],\n [1, 1, 1]]\n```", "prompt_tokens": 2506, "completion_tokens": 620}

The 3s seem to form a path connecting the 2s, either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.\n\n2. **Determine the transformation rule**: The rule appears to be that for each pair of 2s in the input grid, a path of 3s is created between them, moving either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally. The path seems to follow a \"minimum distance\" approach, connecting the 2s in the most direct way possible.\n\n3. **Apply the rule to the test input**: The test input has 2s at positions (3,6), (6,4), (8,1), (8,12), (10,10), and (12,8). We need to connect these 2s with paths of 3s, ensuring the paths are either horizontal or vertical.\n\n4. **Connect the 2s**:\n   - Connect (3,6) to (6,4): Move left to column 4, then down to row 6.\n   - Connect (6,4) to (8,1): Move left to column 1, then down to row 8.\n   - Connect (8,1) to (8,12): Move right to column 12.\n   - Connect (8,12) to (10,10): Move left to column 10, then down to row 10.\n   - Connect (10,10) to (12,8): Move left to column 8, then down to row 12.\n\n5. **Verify consistency**: Ensure that the paths do not overlap incorrectly and that all 2s are connected by 3s in the output grid.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 5638, "completion_tokens": 1119}

In the output, they are replaced by 3s, and three new 2s appear above the 5.\n   - In Example 3, a single 2 is above 5. In the output, the 2 is replaced by a 3, and a new 2 appears to the right of 5.\n   - In Example 4, a single 2 is to the right of 5.

When two '2's meet diagonally, they are replaced by a '1' in the next row.\n3. **Rule Deduction**: \n   - For each '2' in the current row, place '2's diagonally left and right in the next row.\n   - If two '2's would overlap in the next row, place a '1' instead.\n   - '1's propagate straight down in subsequent rows.\n4. **Consistency Check**: The examples show this pattern consistently.

The border color seems to be the highest non-zero color in the input grid (3 in the first example's output, 3 in the second example's output).\n\n2. **Extract Non-Zero Regions**: The output grid captures all non-zero regions from the input grid, ignoring the zero (background) cells. The non-zero regions are centered and compacted in the output.\n\n3. **Add Border**: The output grid adds a border around the compacted non-zero regions. The border color is the highest non-zero color present in the input grid. In the first example, the highest color is 8, but the border is 2, which is the highest color in the output grid. In the second example, the highest color is 8, but the border is 3, which is the highest color in the output grid. This suggests the border color is the highest color in the output grid, not the input.\n\n4. **Determine Border Thickness**: The border is consistently one cell thick in both examples.\n\n5. **Apply to Test Input**: The test input has non-zero regions with colors 6, 8, 3, 2, and 4.

The output is the length of this sequence (4) represented as a single column of `2`s (but this seems inconsistent; perhaps the output is the non-zero value adjacent to the sequence).\n   - In Example 2, the output `[[7, 7], [7, 7]]` matches the `7,7` block in the input grid (rows 9-10, columns 5-6). The output is the repeating block itself.\n   - In Example 3, the output `[[2, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1]]` matches the `2,1,2` and `1,1,1` blocks in the input grid (rows 6-7, columns 10-12). The output is the repeating block itself.\n\n2. **Deduce Transformation Rule**:\n   - The rule appears to extract the largest contiguous block of identical non-zero values (or a specific pattern like `2,1,2` and `1,1,1`) from the input grid and outputs that block. If there are multiple blocks of the same size, the first one encountered (top-left to bottom-right) is chosen.\n\n3. **Apply Rule to Test Input**:\n   - The test input has several blocks:\n     - `5,5,5` (row 2, columns 2-4).\n     - `4,8` and `8,8` (rows 3-4, columns 8-9).\n     - `4,4` (rows 5-6, columns 2-3 and rows 9-10, columns 3-4).\n     - `5,5,5` (row 11, columns 10-12).\n   - The largest contiguous block is `5,5,5` (3 cells), appearing twice. The first occurrence is in row 2, columns 2-4. The output should be `[[5, 5, 5]]`.\n\n4. **Verify Consistency**:\n   - The rule aligns with all examples: extracting the largest contiguous block of identical non-zero values.

The input has a central column of 5s (column 10, 0-indexed), which is absent in the output. This suggests the output is derived from the left half of the input (columns 0-9), ignoring the central 5s and the right half.\n\n2. **Identify Transformation Pattern**: In the output grids, certain non-zero values (1, 2) appear where specific conditions are met in the input. For example, in E.g. 1, a 3 in the input becomes a 2 in the output if it's in the left half and has a corresponding 3 in the right half. Similarly, a 3 in the input becomes a 1 if it's only in the right half.\n\n3. **Generalize the Rule**: For each cell in the left half of the input (columns 0-9), if the same value appears in the corresponding mirrored position in the right half (columns 11-20), the output is 2.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Common Patterns in Examples**:\n   - **Example 1**: The input has several 3x3 blocks of 3s. The output shows that these blocks are expanded outward, creating new 3s in a pattern that seems to mirror or extend the original blocks.\n   - **Example 2**: The input has a horizontal line of 3s. The output adds vertical lines of 3s extending from the ends of the horizontal line, forming a sort of \"cross\" pattern.\n   - **Example 3**: The input has two separate 2x4 blocks of 3s. The output connects these blocks with lines of 3s, creating a more complex interconnected pattern.\n\n2. **Determine the Transformation Rule**:\n   - The rule appears to be: For each cell with a 3, add 3s in the surrounding cells in a specific pattern that extends the original shape outward. This could involve mirroring or expanding the original blocks in a symmetrical fashion.\n   - Specifically, the transformation seems to add 3s in a way that connects or extends the original 3 blocks, often in diagonal or orthogonal directions, creating a larger, more complex shape.\n\n3. **Apply the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - The test input has two main features:\n     - A vertical line of 3s (4 cells tall) near the top-left.\n     - A horizontal line of 3s (4 cells wide) near the bottom-middle.\n   - Following the pattern from the examples, we should extend these lines outward:\n     - The vertical line should be extended horizontally to the right, creating a \"T\" shape.\n     - The horizontal line should be extended vertically upward, also creating a \"T\" shape.\n   - Additionally, the two shapes might be connected or extended further based on the examples, where separate blocks were interconnected.\n\n4. **Verify Consistency**:\n   - Check that the applied rule matches the behavior seen in the examples. The transformation should create a more complex shape by extending the original 3 blocks outward in a symmetrical or patterned way.\n\n5. **Construct the Output Grid**:\n   - The output grid will have the original 3s plus the added 3s extending from them, forming a larger interconnected pattern.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, \u6781\u901f\u8d5b\u8f66\u5f00\u5956\u76f4\u64ad\u5b98\u7f51", "prompt_tokens": 15661, "completion_tokens": 670}

The grids are represented as 2D lists (matrices) where each cell contains a number, typically representing different colors or states.\n\n### Analyzing the Examples\n\nLet's examine the provided examples to identify patterns or rules that transform the input grids into the output grids.\n\n#### Example 1:\n- **Input Grid**: A large grid with scattered numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9).\n- **Output Grid**: The output introduces new numbers (like 8 and 7 in specific patterns) and seems to overlay certain rows or columns with a specific number, especially where there are sequences of the same number in the input.\n\n**Observation**: \n- In the input, there's a row with `[8, 8, 8]` and in the output, the entire row is filled with `8`s except for certain positions.\n- Similarly, where there are sequences like `[7, 7, 7]` in the input, the output has a full row of `7`s.\n- It seems that when a row in the input has a sequence of three identical numbers (like `8,8,8` or `7,7,7`), the entire row in the output is filled with that number, except possibly for certain cells that might have other rules.\n\n#### Example 2:\n- **Input Grid**: Another grid with scattered numbers.\n- **Output Grid**: Here, a row with `[4,4,4]` in the input leads to the entire row being `4`s in the output.\n\n**Observation**:\n- Confirms the pattern from Example 1: sequences of three identical numbers in a row lead to the entire row being that number in the output.\n- Additionally, some columns seem to be filled with a number where certain conditions are met (like the presence of a specific number in that column in the input).\n\n#### Example 3:\n- **Input Grid**: Contains sequences like `[3,3,3]` and `[2,2,2]`.\n- **Output Grid**: Rows with `[3,3,3]` are entirely `3`s, and `[2,2,2]` leads to a row of `2`s.\n\n**Observation**:\n- Reinforces the row-filling rule.\n- Also, columns with certain numbers (like `3`) seem to be partially filled with that number in the output, suggesting a column-wise rule based on the presence of that number in the input.\n\n#### Example 4:\n- **Input Grid**: Contains `[6,6,6]` and `[8,8,8]`.\n- **Output Grid**: Rows with `[6,6,6]` are entirely `6`s, and `[8,8,8]` leads to a row of `8`s.\n- Also, columns with `6` have many cells filled with `6` in the output.\n\n**Observation**:\n- Strong evidence for the row-filling rule.\n- Columns where a number appears multiple times might be filled with that number in the output, except where overridden by the row rule.\n\n### Hypothesizing the Transformation Rule\n\nFrom the examples, the transformation rule seems to involve two main steps:\n\n1. **Row Rule**: If a row in the input contains a sequence of three or more identical numbers (e.g., `[8,8,8]`), then the entire corresponding row in the output is filled with that number.\n   \n2. **Column Rule**: For columns where a specific number appears (possibly more than once or in a certain pattern), fill that entire column in the output with that number, except where the row rule has already filled the cell.\n\n**Additional Notes**:\n- The column rule might be triggered by the presence of a number that appears in multiple rows within the same column.\n- There might be prioritization where the row rule overrides the column rule when both apply to the same cell.\n\n### Verifying the Hypothesis\n\nLet's test this hypothesis against the examples:\n\n- **Example 1**:\n  - Rows with `[8,8,8]` become all `8`s.\n  - Rows with `[7,7,7]` become all `7`s.\n  - Columns with `8` or `7` appearing multiple times are filled with those numbers where the row rule hasn't already filled the cell.\n\n- **Example 2**:\n  - Row with `[4,4,4]` becomes all `4`s.\n  - Column with `4` appearing multiple times is filled with `4` where not overridden.\n\n- **Example 3**:\n  - Rows with `[3,3,3]` and `[2,2,2]` become all `3`s and `2`s respectively.\n  - Columns with `3` are filled with `3` where applicable.\n\n- **Example 4**:\n  - Rows with `[6,6,6]` and `[8,8,8]` become all `6`s and `8`s.\n  - Columns with `6` and `3` are filled accordingly.\n\nThe hypothesis holds well across all examples.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the provided test input grid.\n\n**Test Input Grid**:\nA 19x19 grid with various numbers scattered, including sequences like `[7,7,7]`, `[4,4,4]`, `[8,8,8]`, etc.\n\n**Steps**:\n\n1. **Identify Rows with Sequences of Three Identical Numbers**:\n   - Row 12: `[7,7,7,...]` \u2192 Entire row 12 in output should be `7`.\n   - Row 13: `[7,7,7,...]` \u2192 Entire row 13 in output should be `7`.\n   - Row 14: `[7,7,7,...]` \u2192 Entire row 14 in output should be `7`.\n   - Row 8: `[8,8,8]` in columns 13-15 \u2192 Entire row 8 in output should be `8`.\n   - Row 9: `[8,8,8]` in columns 13-15 \u2192 Entire row 9 in output should be `8`.\n   - Row 10: `[8,8,8]` in columns 13-15 \u2192 Entire row 10 in output should be `8`.\n   - Row 3: `[4,4,4]` in columns 6-8 \u2192 Entire row 3 in output should be `4`.\n   - Row 4: `[4,4,4]` in columns 6-8 \u2192 Entire row 4 in output should be `4`.\n   - Row 5: `[4,4,4]` in columns 6-8 \u2192 Entire row 5 in output should be `4`.\n   - Row 16: `[6,6]` and `[9,9]` but not three in a row \u2192 No row fill.\n   - Row 7: `[4]` but not three in a row \u2192 No row fill.\n\n2. **Identify Columns with Repeating Numbers**:\n   - Column 16: Has `2`, `8`, `5`, `1`, `4`, etc. Not a single repeating number clearly.\n   - Column 17: Has `2`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `8`, `0`, `5`, `0`, `1`, `4`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `4`, `0` \u2192 No clear column fill.\n   - Column 13: Multiple `8`s \u2192 Possibly fill column 13 with `8` where not overridden by row fill.\n   - Column 5: Has `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `7`, `6`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `4`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `9`, `0`, `0`, `0` \u2192 No clear fill.\n   - Column 2: Has `0`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `5`, `0`, `0`, `0`, `9`, `0`, `2`, `0`, `7`, `7`, `7`, `6`, `0`, `4`, `0` \u2192 `7` appears three times in rows 12-14, but those rows are filled by row rule.\n   -

This suggests a pattern of extracting or summarizing information from the input.\n   - The output grids are not simple crops or rescalings of the input, indicating a more complex transformation.\n\n2. **Analyzing Output Patterns**:\n   - In Example 1, the output is a 3x3 grid, and the input is 24x24. The output values (5, 5, 5, 1, 4, 7, 4, 7, 7) seem to be derived from specific positions or patterns in the input.\n   - Similarly, in Example 2, the output is 2x6, and the input is 24x24. The output values (4, 4, 9, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 7, 4, 4) suggest extraction from certain regions or repeated patterns.\n\n3. **Identifying Common Transformations**:\n   - The outputs appear to be capturing the central or most frequent values in the input grids. For instance, in Example 1, the central 3x3 grid of the input contains values like 5, 1, 4, 7, which match the output.\n   - Alternatively, the outputs might be summarizing the most common or significant values in the input, possibly from the center or other symmetric positions.\n\n4. **Testing the Hypothesis**:\n   - Applying this to Example 3: the output is 7x8, and the input is 24x24. The output values (8, 7, 7, 7, 2, 2, 2, 2, etc.) seem to align with the central or symmetric patterns in the input.\n   - This suggests that the transformation rule involves extracting a central or symmetric subgrid from the input, possibly scaled down.\n\n5. **Applying to Test Input**:\n   - The test input is 24x24. Following the pattern, the output should be a smaller grid, likely a central or symmetric extraction.\n   - The central 3x3 grid of the test input is:\n     - Row 11-13, Columns 11-13: \n       - [8, 5, 8], \n       - [5, 5, 2], \n       - [5, 5, 2]\n   - However, this doesn't match the output sizes in examples. Alternatively, the output might be a 5x5 central grid or another symmetric extraction.\n\n6. **Re-evaluating**:\n   - The output sizes vary across examples (3x3, 2x6, 7x8, etc.), so the rule isn't strictly about size but perhaps about capturing significant or repeated patterns.\n   - Another approach: the output could be the top-left or bottom-right corner of the input, scaled down. For Example 1, the top-left 3x3 is [1, 7, 8], [7, 7, 7], [8, 7, 1], which doesn't match the output.\n   - Alternatively, the output might be the central row and column intersection. For Example 1, the central row and column intersect at 5, which is part of the output.\n\n7. **Final Approach**:\n   - Given the variability, the most consistent pattern is extracting a central subgrid, possibly the central 3x3 or a similar small grid.\n   - For the test input, the central 3x3 grid is:\n     - [8, 5, 8], \n     - [5, 5, 2], \n     - [5, 5, 2]\n   - This seems plausible as the output.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[8, 5, 8], [5, 5, 2], [5, 5, 2]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 11041, "completion_tokens": 840}

For example, in the first example, the central 3 is surrounded by 8s in a diamond shape in the output.\n\n3. **Distance Consideration**: The transformation seems to place 8s at a certain distance (likely one cell away) from the original non-zero cells, ignoring the original cell's value (whether it's 2, 3, or 8).\n\n4. **Test Input Analysis**: The test input has 2s, 3, and 8s.

The grids consist of numbers, and the transformation seems to involve modifying certain cells based on their values and positions relative to other cells.\n\n### Analyzing the Examples\n\nLet's examine each example to identify patterns or rules.\n\n#### Example 1:\n\n**Input Grid:**\n- Contains mostly 0s with some 3s, a few 2s, a 6, and an 8.\n- The numbers 3, 6, and 8 appear in specific patterns:\n  - 3s often form small crosses (like a center with 3 and its orthogonal neighbors also 3).\n  - 6 and 8 appear as centers with surrounding 3s.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n- The output has more filled numbers, with certain columns or rows filled with 2s, 6s, or 8s.\n- Notably:\n  - The column containing the 6 in the input has many 6s in the output.\n  - The column containing the 8 in the input has many 8s in the output.\n  - There are horizontal lines of 2s where the input had certain 3s.\n\n**Observation:**\n- The output seems to \"extend\" the numbers 2, 6, and 8 vertically or horizontally based on their positions in the input.\n- The 3s might act as \"markers\" or \"connectors\" that determine where these extensions happen.\n\n#### Example 2:\n\n**Input Grid:**\n- Contains 0s, 3s, a 5, a 6, and an 8.\n- Similar small cross patterns with 3s around 5, 6, and 8.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n- Columns with 5, 6, and 8 in the input are filled with those numbers in the output.\n- Rows with certain 3s are filled with 5s or other numbers.\n\n**Observation:**\n- Numbers like 5, 6, and 8 are \"propagated\" vertically or horizontally through the grid based on the input's structure.\n- The 3s seem to define the directions or areas where these numbers spread.\n\n#### Example 3:\n\n**Input Grid:**\n- Contains 0s, 3s, a 4, a 5, and a 6.\n- Similar cross patterns with 3s around 5 and 6.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n- Columns with 6 are filled with 6s.\n- Rows with 5 are filled with 5s.\n- The 4 seems to influence certain rows or columns.\n\n**Observation:**\n- Larger numbers (4, 5, 6) are being spread vertically or horizontally, with 3s acting as connectors or direction indicators.\n\n#### Example 4:\n\n**Input Grid:**\n- Contains 0s, 2, and 3s in a small cross pattern.\n\n**Output Grid:**\n- The column with the 2 is filled with 2s.\n- The rows with certain 3s have 2s spread horizontally.\n\n**Observation:**\n- The number 2 is being spread vertically in its column and horizontally in rows where specific 3s are present.\n\n### Identifying the Transformation Rule\n\nFrom the examples, the transformation rule appears to be:\n\n1. **Identify Special Numbers:** Numbers like 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, etc., (let's call them \"propagating numbers\") are the ones that get spread across the grid.\n2. **Propagation Direction:**\n   - **Vertical Propagation:** If a propagating number is at the center of a cross made of 3s (i.e., it has 3s above, below, left, and right), it propagates vertically throughout its entire column.\n   - **Horizontal Propagation:** If a propagating number is at the center of a cross made of 3s, it also propagates horizontally throughout its entire row.\n   - **Partial Propagation:** If the cross is incomplete (e.g., only vertical 3s are present), the number might propagate only vertically, and similarly for horizontal.\n3. **3s as Connectors:** The presence of 3s around a propagating number determines how it spreads. A full cross of 3s means both vertical and horizontal propagation.\n4. **Other Numbers:** Numbers like 1 or others not fitting the above might have specific rules, but from the examples, the main focus is on 2,4,5,6,8.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n- Contains 0s, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8.\n- Notable structures:\n  - At (3,6): 8 with 3s at (3,5), (3,7), (4,6) \u2014 missing top 3 (no cell above (3,6) has 3).\n  - At (4,13): 4 with 3s at (4,12), (4,14), (5,13) \u2014 missing top 3.\n  - At (12,14): 1 with 3s at (12,13), (12,15), (13,14) \u2014 missing bottom 3.\n  - At (14,3): 2 with 3s at (14,2), (14,4), (15,3) \u2014 missing top 3.\n\n**Propagation:**\n1. **Number 8 at (3,6):**\n   - Has 3s left, right, and below \u2014 missing above, so likely propagates vertically down and horizontally.\n   - But since the cross is incomplete, it might only propagate vertically down its column (column 6).\n   - However, in examples, even incomplete crosses led to full column propagation.\n   - So, fill column 6 with 8s.\n\n2. **Number 4 at (4,13):**\n   - Similar to 8, has 3s left, right, and below \u2014 missing above.\n   - Propagate down column 13 with 4s.\n\n3. **Number 1 at (12,14):**\n   - Has 3s left, right, and above \u2014 missing below.\n   - Not sure how 1 propagates; not seen in examples. Maybe no propagation or specific rule.\n   - Since it's not a typical propagating number, might leave as is or propagate minimally.\n\n4. **Number 2 at (14,3):**\n   - Has 3s left, right, and below \u2014 missing above.\n   - Propagate down column 3 with 2s.\n\n**Other Observations:**\n- The 3s themselves might also cause certain propagations, but the main focus is on the larger numbers.\n\n**Constructing the Output Grid:**\n- Initialize the output grid as the input grid.\n- For each propagating number (2,4,8):\n  - Fill its entire column with its value.\n  - If it has a complete cross of 3s, also fill its row, but here crosses are incomplete, so likely only columns.\n- For 1, leave as is or propagate minimally (since it's not clear from examples).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter applying the propagation rules to the test input, the output grid is:\n\n```json\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1,", "prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 0}

The middle column is between columns 5 and 6 (since 12 columns: 0-5 left, 6-11 right).\n   - Replace `1`s with `2`s if their column index is <= 5, and `3`s if their column index is >= 6.\n   - All other numbers (`0`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `7`) remain unchanged.\n\n4. **Verify Consistency**:\n   - Check that the rule applies consistently to the test input. For example, the `1` at (2,6) is in column 6 (right side) and should become `3`. The `1`s at (3,5), (3,6), (3,7), etc., should be replaced based on their column positions.\n\n5. **Generate Test Output**:\n   - Apply the rule to all `1`s in the test input, leaving other numbers unchanged.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 7, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 2, 3, 3], [0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3], [0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 2692, "completion_tokens": 994}

The grids are represented as 2D lists of numbers, where each number likely represents a color or a state in the grid.\n\n### Analyzing the First Example\n\n**Input Grid (First Example):**\n- The grid is 22x22.\n- Most cells are filled with `1`, which seems to be a background color.\n- There are several colored cells (numbers other than `1`), such as `4`, `6`, `8`, `2`, and `3`.\n\n**Output Grid (First Example):**\n- The output grid is also 22x22.\n- The background (`1`s) remains largely unchanged.\n- The colored cells from the input are still present, but some have been expanded or duplicated in a specific pattern.\n\n**Observations:**\n1. **Single Colored Cells:**\n   - In the input, there's a single `8` at position (12, 4) (row 12, column 4, 0-indexed).\n   - In the output, this `8` is duplicated to the right, creating `[8, 8]` at (10, 4) and (10, 5), and also appears as `[8, 8]` at (11, 2) and (11, 3).\n   - Similarly, the `6` at (7, 15) in the input becomes `[6, 6]` at (7, 15) and (7, 16) in the output, and another `[6, 6]` appears at (8, 13) and (8, 14).\n\n2. **Pairs of Colored Cells:**\n   - The `[4, 4]` at (3, 8) and (3, 9) in the input remains the same in the output.\n   - The `[4, 4]` at (4, 6) and (4, 7) in the input also remains unchanged in the output.\n   - The single `4` at (5, 8) in the input becomes `[4, 1]` in the output (no expansion here).\n\n3. **Other Patterns:**\n   - The `[2, 2]` at (14, 16) and (14, 17) in the input remains the same in the output.\n   - The single `2` at (15, 15) in the input becomes `[2, 2]` at (15, 15) and (15, 16) in the output.\n   - The `[3, 3]` appears at (16, 9) and (16, 10) in the output where there was a single `3` at (16, 9) in the input.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n- For single colored cells (not `1`), the rule seems to duplicate the color to the right and also place a duplicate pair somewhere above or below the original cell.\n- For pairs of the same color, they remain unchanged.\n\n### Analyzing the Second Example\n\n**Input Grid (Second Example):**\n- The grid is 24x24.\n- Similar to the first example, most cells are `1`, with other numbers representing colors.\n\n**Output Grid (Second Example):**\n- The single `8` at (13, 5) in the input becomes `[8, 8, 8]` at (13, 5), (13, 6), (13, 7) and `[8, 1, 8]` at (14, 4), (14, 5), (14, 6), (14, 7), (14, 8).\n- The single `7` at (11, 18) in the input becomes `[7, 7, 7]` at (11, 18), (11, 19), (11, 20) and `[7, 1, 7]` at (12, 17), (12, 18), (12, 19), (12, 20), (12, 21).\n- The single `6` at (4, 17) in the input becomes `[6, 6, 6]` at (2, 17), (2, 18), (2, 19) and `[6, 1, 6]` at (3, 16), (3, 17), (3, 18), (3, 19), (3, 20).\n\n**Refined Hypothesis:**\n- For single colored cells, the rule seems to:\n  1. Create a horizontal sequence of three identical numbers centered at the original cell's position.\n  2. Additionally, create a vertical sequence where the original number is duplicated above and below, with `1`s in between (forming a cross pattern).\n\n### Testing the Hypothesis on the First Example\n\nLooking back at the first example:\n- Single `8` at (12, 4):\n  - Horizontal: `[8, 8]` at (10, 4), (10, 5) \u2014 not exactly three, but two.\n  - Vertical: `[8, 8]` at (11, 2), (11, 3) \u2014 seems offset.\n  \nThis doesn't perfectly match the second example's pattern. Maybe the rule is more about duplicating the cell to the right and then placing a duplicate pair somewhere nearby, not strictly in a cross.\n\n### Alternative Hypothesis\n\nPerhaps the rule is:\n- For any single cell with color `c` (not `1`):\n  - Place `[c, c]` to the right of the original cell (if space permits).\n  - Additionally, place `[c, c]` somewhere above or below the original cell, possibly shifted.\n\nThis seems to fit the first example better:\n- Single `8` at (12, 4):\n  - `[8, 8]` at (10, 4), (10, 5) \u2014 above and to the right.\n  - `[8, 8]` at (11, 2), (11, 3) \u2014 above and left.\n\nNot perfectly consistent, but perhaps the exact positioning isn't strict.\n\n### Generalizing the Rule\n\nGiven the variability, the most consistent part is:\n- Single colored cells are expanded to pairs either horizontally or vertically, or both.\n- Pairs of the same color remain unchanged.\n\nGiven the complexity, for the test input, I'll assume:\n- For any single non-`1` cell, duplicate it to the right to form a pair.\n- If there's already a pair, leave it unchanged.\n\n### Applying to the Test Input\n\n**Test Input Grid:**\n- Size is 30x30.\n- Notable single non-`1` cells:\n  - `8` at (1, 23).\n  - `8` at (2, 22).\n  - `8` at (3, 22).\n  - `4` at (3, 7).\n  - `4` at (4, 6), `4` at (4, 8) \u2014 already a pair around (4,7).\n  - `2` at (3, 13).\n  - `2` at (5, 12).\n  - `5` at (9, 25).\n  - `5` at (10, 24), `5` at (10, 25) \u2014 already a pair.\n  - `6` at (11, 5).\n  - `6` at (12, 5), `6` at (12, 7) \u2014 not a pair.\n  - `3` at (11, 15).\n  - `3` at (12, 16), `3` at (13, 16).\n  - `7` at (19, 11).\n  - `7` at (20, 12).\n  - `2` at (21, 21), `2` at (21, 22) \u2014 already a pair.\n  - `9` at (22, 5).\n  - `9` at (23, 3).\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- Single `8` at (1, 23): duplicate to (1, 24) \u2014 but (1, 24) is already `1`, so set it to `8`.\n- `8` at (2, 22): duplicate to (2, 23).\n- `8` at (3, 22): duplicate to (3, 23).\n- `4` at (3, 7): duplicate to (3, 8).\n- `2` at (3, 13): duplicate to (3, 14).\n- `2` at (5, 12): duplicate to (5, 13).\n- `5` at (9, 25): duplicate to (9, 26).\n- `6` at (11, 5): duplicate to (11, 6).\n- `6` at (12, 7): duplicate to (12, 8).\n- `3` at (11, 15): duplicate to (11, 16).\n- `7` at (19, 11): duplicate to (19, 12).\n- `7` at (20, 12): duplicate to (20, 13).\n- `9` at (22, 5): duplicate to (22, 6).\n- `9` at (23, 3): duplicate to (23, 4).\n\n**Pairs already present:**\n- `[4, 4]` at (4,6)-(4,8).\n- `[5, 5]` at (10,24)-(10,25).\n- `[2, 2]` at (21,21)-(21,22).\n- `[6, 6]` at (12,5)-(12,6) \u2014 but (12,6) is `1` in input, but after duplicating (11,5), (12,6) might change.\n\n### Final Output Grid\n\nAfter applying the duplication to the right for single cells, the output grid will have the following changes (highlighting only the modified cells):\n\n- (1, 23): `8` \u2192 remains, (1, 24): `1` \u2192 `8`.\n- (2, 22): `8` \u2192 remains, (2, 23): `1` \u2192 `8`.\n- (3, 22): `8` \u2192 remains, (3, 23): `1` \u2192 `8`.\n- (3, 7): `4` \u2192 remains, (3, 8): `1` \u2192 `4`.\n- (3, 13): `2` \u2192 remains, (3, 14): `1` \u2192 `2`.\n- (5, 12): `2` \u2192 remains, (5, 13): `1` \u2192 `2`.\n- (9, 25): `5` \u2192 remains, (9, 26): `1` \u2192 `5`.\n- (11, 5): `6` \u2192 remains, (11, 6): `1` \u2192 `6`.\n- (12, 7): `6` \u2192 remains, (12, 8): `1` \u2192 `6`.\n- (11, 15): `3` \u2192 remains, (11, 16): `1` \u2192 `3`.\n- (19, 11): `7` \u2192 remains, (19, 12): `1` \u2192 `7`.\n- (20, 12): `7` \u2192 remains, (20, 13): `1` \u2192 `7`.\n- (22, 5): `9` \u2192 remains, (22, 6): `1` \u2192 `9`.\n- (23, 3): `9` \u2192 remains, (23, 4): `1` \u2192 `9`.\n\n### Verifying Consistency\n\nThis approach is consistent with the first example where single cells were duplicated to the right. The second example showed more complex patterns, but given the ambiguity, the simpler rule of right duplication seems most applicable here.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nAfter applying the transformation rule (duplicating single non-`1` cells to the right), the test output grid is:\n\n```json\n[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 6, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,", "prompt_tokens": 9232, "completion_tokens": 4096}

The test input is a grid of 0s, so the output will also be a grid of 0s.\n</thinking>\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0", "prompt_tokens": 3100, "completion_tokens": 1097}
