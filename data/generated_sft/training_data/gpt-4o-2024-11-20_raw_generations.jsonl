This pattern continues for the subsequent rows with `6`s, where the `6`s are shifted rightward by one position compared to the input.\n\n**Observation 2:** In the rows with `2`s (starting from row 8), the `2`s are shifted one position to the right in the output grid compared to the input grid.\n\n---\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n\n**Input Grid:**\n```\n000000000\n088888000\n080000800\n008000080\n000800008\n000088888\n000000000\n000000000\n```\n\n**Output Grid:**\n```\n000000000\n008888800\n008000080\n000800008\n000080008\n000088888\n000000000\n000000000\n```\n\n**Observation 1:** In the second row, the `8`s in the input grid are shifted one position to the right in the output grid.

By identifying the transformation rules, we can apply them to the test input grid to generate the correct output.\n\n### Observations from the Examples:\n\n#### Example 1:\n1. The input grid contains patterns of digits (e.g., `888`, `808`, `222`) in specific regions.\n2. The output grid modifies these patterns:\n   - The `888` and `808` patterns are extended horizontally with `3`s.\n   - The `222` pattern is extended vertically with alternating rows of `2` and `202`.\n3. The transformation appears to involve extending or modifying specific patterns in the grid, depending on their location and orientation.\n\n#### Example 2:\n1. The input grid contains patterns such as `2011104` and isolated `4`s.\n2. The output grid modifies these patterns:\n   - The `4`s are extended into horizontal lines of `4`s.\n   - The `2011104` pattern is surrounded by alternating `2` and `20` patterns.\n3. Again, the transformation involves extending or modifying specific patterns in the grid.\n\n#### Example 3:\n1. The input grid contains patterns such as `60`, `550`, and `11`.\n2. The output grid modifies these patterns:\n   - The `60` pattern is extended into diagonal patterns of `6`s.\n   - The `11` pattern is extended into diagonal patterns of `1`s.\n   - The `550` and `505` patterns remain unchanged.\n3. The transformation involves extending patterns diagonally for certain numbers.\n\n### General Rule:\nThe transformation rule depends on the specific patterns in the input grid:\n1. Certain numbers (e.g., `8`, `2`, `4`, `6`, `1`) are extended or modified in specific ways:\n   - Horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, depending on the context.\n2. Other numbers or patterns remain unchanged.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\nThe test input grid contains patterns such as `888`, `808`, `333`, and isolated `4`s. Based on the examples:\n1. The `888` and `808` patterns will be extended horizontally with `3`s, as in Example 1.\n2. The `333` pattern will be extended vertically with alternating rows of `3` and `303`, as in Example 1.\n3. The isolated `4`s will remain unchanged, as there is no evidence of diagonal extension for `4` in the examples.\n\n### Step-by-Step Transformation:\n1. Extend the `888` and `808` patterns horizontally with `3`s.\n2. Extend the `333` pattern vertically with alternating rows of `3` and `303`.\n3. Leave other parts of the grid unchanged.\n\n### Resulting Output Grid:\nWe apply the transformation rules to the test input grid to produce the final output grid.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 1456, "completion_tokens": 1966}

Let's break down the examples step by step:\n\n---\n\n**Example 1 Analysis:**\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  022200000\n  220200000\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  000880000\n  000880000\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  ```\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  022200000\n  220200000\n  000880000\n  000880000\n  000000000\n  000000000\n  ```\n- **Observation:** The pattern in the input grid is shifted downward. The non-zero elements (2s and 8s) in the input grid are moved down by a certain number of rows. Specifically:\n  - The block of 2s (starting at row 2) is moved down by 6 rows to start at row 8.\n  - The block of 8s (starting at row 10) remains in the same position.\n\n---\n\n**Example 2 Analysis:**\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  0000000000\n  0220000000\n  0220000000\n  2220000000\n  0220008800\n  0000008800\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  ```\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  0000000000\n  0000220000\n  0000220000\n  0002220000\n  0000228800\n  0000008800\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  ```\n- **Observation:** The non-zero elements (2s and 8s) are shifted to the right. Specifically:\n  - The block of 2s (starting at column 1) is shifted right by 4 columns to start at column 5.\n  - The block of 8s (starting at column 8) remains in the same position.\n\n---\n\n**Example 3 Analysis:**\n- **Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  0000000000\n  0008800000\n  0008800000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0002220000\n  0222220000\n  0022000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  ```\n- **Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  0000000000\n  0008800000\n  0008800000\n  0002220000\n  0222220000\n  0022000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  ```\n- **Observation:** The non-zero elements (2s and 8s) are shifted upward. Specifically:\n  - The block of 2s (starting at row 6) is moved up by 3 rows to start at row 3.\n  - The block of 8s (starting at row 1) remains in the same position.\n\n---\n\n**General Rule:**\nFrom the examples, we observe that the transformation involves shifting the non-zero elements (2s and 8s) in the grid. The direction and magnitude of the shift depend on the position of the non-zero elements:\n1. If the non-zero elements are in the upper part of the grid, they are shifted downward.\n2. If the non-zero elements are in the lower part of the grid, they are shifted upward.\n3. If the non-zero elements are on the left side of the grid, they are shifted to the right.\n4. If the non-zero elements are on the right side of the grid, they remain in the same position.\n\nThe exact magnitude of the shift is determined by the position of the elements relative to the center of the grid.\n\n---\n\n**Test Input Analysis:**\n- **Test Input Grid:**\n  ```\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000020000\n  0000022000\n  0880022000\n  0880002000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  ```\n- **Step-by-Step Transformation:**\n  1. The block of 2s (starting at row 4, column 5) is shifted downward by 3 rows to start at row 7.\n  2. The block of 8s (starting at row 6, column 1) remains in the same position because it is already on the left side of the grid.\n\n- **Resulting Output Grid:**\n  ```\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000000000\n  0000020000\n  0000022000\n  0880022000\n  0880002000\n  0000000000\n  ```\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n</thinking>\n<answer>\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 647, "completion_tokens": 1588}
