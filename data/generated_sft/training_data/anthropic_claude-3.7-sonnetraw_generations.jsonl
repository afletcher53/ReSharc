{"task_id": "007bbfb7", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet", "raw_response": "<thinking>\nLet me analyze the examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n077\n777\n077\n\nOutput:\n000077077\n000777777\n000077077\n077077077\n777777777\n077077077\n000077077\n000777777\n000077077\n\nI notice that the output is a 9x9 grid. It seems like the original 3x3 input is being placed in different positions of the output grid. Specifically, I see the input pattern in:\n- Top-right corner (columns 6-8, rows 0-2)\n- Middle-center (columns 3-5, rows 3-5)\n- Bottom-left corner (columns 0-2, rows 6-8)\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n404\n000\n040\n\nOutput:\n404000404\n000000000\n040000040\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000404000\n000000000\n000040000\n\nAgain, I see the input pattern in:\n- Top-left corner (columns 0-2, rows 0-2)\n- Top-right corner (columns 6-8, rows 0-2)\n- Bottom-center (columns 3-5, rows 6-8)\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n000\n002\n202\n\nOutput:\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000002\n000000202\n000000000\n002000002\n202000202\n\nHere I see the input pattern in:\n- Bottom-right corner (columns 6-8, rows 6-8)\n- Middle-right (columns 6-8, rows 3-5)\n- Bottom-center (columns 3-5, rows 6-8)\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n660\n600\n066\n\nOutput:\n660660000\n600600000\n066066000\n660000000\n600000000\n066000000\n000660660\n000600600\n000066066\n\nHere I see the input pattern in:\n- Top-left corner (columns 0-2, rows 0-2)\n- Top-center (columns 3-5, rows 0-2)\n- Middle-left (columns 0-2, rows 3-5)\n- Bottom-right corner (columns 6-8, rows 6-8)\n- Bottom-center (columns 3-5, rows 6-8)\n\nExample 5:\nInput:\n222\n000\n022\n\nOutput:\n222222222\n000000000\n022022022\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000222222\n000000000\n000022022\n\nHere I see the input pattern in:\n- Top row, all three positions (columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, rows 0-2)\n- Bottom-center (columns 3-5, rows 6-8)\n- Bottom-right (columns 6-8, rows 6-8)\n\nI'm starting to see a pattern. The rule seems to be:\n1. The output is a 9x9 grid divided into a 3x3 grid of 3x3 cells\n2. The input 3x3 grid is placed in specific positions based on the pattern of non-zero values in the input\n\nLet me check each example again:\n\nExample 1: Input has non-zero values in the middle column and middle row. Output has the input pattern in top-right, middle-center, and bottom-left.\n\nExample 2: Input has non-zero values in the top row and middle column. Output has the input pattern in top-left, top-right, and bottom-center.\n\nExample 3: Input has non-zero values in the bottom row and right column. Output has the input pattern in middle-right, bottom-center, and bottom-right.\n\nExample 4: Input has non-zero values in the left column, top row, and bottom-right. Output has the input pattern in top-left, top-center, middle-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right.\n\nExample 5: Input has non-zero values in the top row and bottom-right. Output has the input pattern in top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-center, and bottom-right.\n\nI think I understand the rule now:\n- For each position in the 3x3 input grid that contains a non-zero value, place the entire input grid in the corresponding position of the 3x3 grid of 3x3 cells in the output.\n\nFor example, if the input has a non-zero value in the top-left corner, then the input grid is placed in the top-left 3x3 cell of the output grid.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input:\n707\n707\n770\n\nThis input has non-zero values in:\n- Top row: positions (0,0), (0,2)\n- Middle row: positions (1,0), (1,2)\n- Bottom row: positions (2,0), (2,1)\n\nSo the output should have the input pattern in:\n- Top-left (due to non-zero at input position 0,0)\n- Top-right (due to non-zero at input position 0,2)\n- Middle-left (due to non-zero at input position 1,0)\n- Middle-right (due to non-zero at input position 1,2)\n- Bottom-left (due to non-zero at input position 2,0)\n- Bottom-center (due to non-zero at input position 2,1)\n\nLet me construct the output grid:\n</thinking>\n\n<thinking>\nLet me construct the 9x9 output grid for the test input:\n707\n707\n770\n\nFirst, I'll create an empty 9x9 grid filled with zeros:\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n\nNow, I'll place the input pattern in the positions corresponding to non-zero values in the input:\n\n1. Top-left (due to 7 at input position 0,0):\n707000000\n707000000\n770000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n\n2. Top-right (due to 7 at input position 0,2):\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n\n3. Middle-left (due to 7 at input position 1,0):\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000000\n707000000\n770000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n\n4. Middle-right (due to 7 at input position 1,2):\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n\n5. Bottom-left (due to 7 at input position 2,0):\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000000\n707000000\n770000000\n\n6. Bottom-center (due to 7 at input position 2,1):\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707707000\n707707000\n770770000\n\nThis should be the final output grid.\n\nLet me double-check by verifying the pattern with the examples again:\n\nExample 1: Input has non-zeros in middle column and middle row. Output has pattern in top-right, middle-center, and bottom-left. \u2713\n\nExample 2: Input has non-zeros in top row and middle column. Output has pattern in top-left, top-right, and bottom-center. \u2713\n\nExample 3: Input has non-zeros in bottom row and right column. Output has pattern in middle-right, bottom-center, and bottom-right. \u2713\n\nExample 4: Input has non-zeros in left column, top row, and bottom-right. Output has pattern in top-left, top-center, middle-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right. \u2713\n\nExample 5: Input has non-zeros in top row and bottom-right. Output has pattern in top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-center, and bottom-right. \u2713\n\nMy solution is consistent with the pattern observed in the examples.\n</thinking>\n\n<thinking>\nI need to be more precise about the rule. Let me re-examine the examples:\n\nThe output is a 9x9 grid that can be viewed as a 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells. The rule seems to be:\n\nFor each position (r,c) in the 3\u00d73 input grid:\n- If the value at position (r,c) is non-zero, then place the entire input grid in the corresponding position of the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nFor example:\n- If input[0][0] is non-zero, place the input in the top-left 3\u00d73 cell of the output\n- If input[0][1] is non-zero, place the input in the top-center 3\u00d73 cell of the output\n- If input[0][2] is non-zero, place the input in the top-right 3\u00d73 cell of the output\n- If input[1][0] is non-zero, place the input in the middle-left 3\u00d73 cell of the output\n- And so on...\n\nLet me verify this with the examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n077\n777\n077\nNon-zero positions: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\nExpected output positions: top-center, top-right, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, bottom-center, bottom-right\nActual output: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left\n\nThis doesn't match my rule. Let me reconsider...\n\nI think the rule might be related to the specific values in the input, not just whether they're non-zero.\n\nLet me look at the examples again, focusing on the specific values:\n\nExample 1:\nInput has 7s in various positions.\nOutput has the input pattern in positions where the original input had 7s.\n\nExample 2:\nInput has 4s in top-left and bottom-right corners, and a 4 in the middle-bottom.\nOutput has the input pattern in top-left, top-right, and bottom-center.\n\nThis doesn't seem to match either.\n\nLet me try a different approach. What if we consider the input as a \"stamp\" and the non-zero values indicate where to stamp the input onto the output grid?\n\nFor Example 1:\nInput:\n077\n777\n077\n\nIf we place this input in the top-left, middle-center, and bottom-right positions of the output grid, and only copy the non-zero values, we get:\n000077077\n000777777\n000077077\n077077077\n777777777\n077077077\n000077077\n000777777\n000077077\n\nThis matches the output!\n\nLet's check Example 2:\nInput:\n404\n000\n040\n\nIf we place this input in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-center positions of the output grid, and only copy the non-zero values, we get:\n404000404\n000000000\n040000040\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000404000\n000000000\n000040000\n\nThis also matches!\n\nI think I've found the rule:\n1. The output is a 9x9 grid\n2. The input is placed in the top-left, top-center, top-right, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right positions of the output grid\n3. For each position in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, it is copied to the corresponding position in the output grid; otherwise, the output grid remains 0 at that position\n\nLet me apply this to the test input:\n707\n707\n770\n\nPlacing this in all 9 positions of the output grid and only copying non-zero values:\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707707000\n707707000\n770770000\n\nThis should be the correct output.\n</thinking>\n\n<thinking>\nI think I've been overcomplicating this. Let me try a simpler approach.\n\nLooking at the examples again, I notice that the output is always a 9\u00d79 grid, which can be viewed as a 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells.\n\nThe rule seems to be:\n- For each position (r,c) in the input grid:\n  - If the value at position (r,c) is non-zero, then copy the entire input grid to the corresponding position in the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nFor example, if input[0][0] is non-zero, then the input grid is copied to the top-left 3\u00d73 cell of the output grid.\n\nLet me verify this with Example 1:\nInput:\n077\n777\n077\n\nNon-zero positions: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\nSo the input should be copied to: top-center, top-right, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, bottom-center, bottom-right\n\nBut the actual output only has the input in: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left\n\nThis still doesn't match. Let me try one more approach.\n\nWhat if the rule is:\n- For each position (r,c) in the input grid:\n  - If the value at position (r,c) is non-zero, then copy the entire input grid to the position (c,r) in the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nThis would mean:\n- If input[0][1] is non-zero, copy to middle-top\n- If input[1][0] is non-zero, copy to left-middle\n- If input[2][2] is non-zero, copy to right-bottom\n\nLet's check Example 1 again:\nInput:\n077\n777\n077\n\nNon-zero positions: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\nUsing the new rule, the input should be copied to: middle-top, right-top, left-middle, middle-middle, right-middle, middle-bottom, right-bottom\n\nBut the actual output has the input in: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left\n\nThis still doesn't match.\n\nLet me try one more approach. What if the rule is based on the specific values in the input?\n\nFor Example 1, the input has 7s. The output has the input pattern in positions where there would be 7s if we expanded the input pattern.\n\nFor Example 2, the input has 4s. The output has the input pattern in positions where there would be 4s if we expanded the input pattern.\n\nThis seems to be the pattern! The rule is:\n- For each unique non-zero value v in the input grid:\n  - Place the input grid in positions of the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells where the value v would be if the input grid was expanded.\n\nLet me verify this with Example 1:\nInput:\n077\n777\n077\n\nThe non-zero value is 7. If we expanded the input pattern, 7s would be in the top-right, middle-center, and bottom-left positions of the 3\u00d73 grid. And indeed, the output has the input pattern in these positions.\n\nLet me check Example 2:\nInput:\n404\n000\n040\n\nThe non-zero value is 4. If we expanded the input pattern, 4s would be in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-center positions of the 3\u00d73 grid. And indeed, the output has the input pattern in these positions.\n\nThis rule seems to work for all examples. Let me apply it to the test input:\n707\n707\n770\n\nThe non-zero value is 7. If we expanded the input pattern, 7s would be in the top-left, top-right, middle-left, middle-right, bottom-left, and bottom-center positions of the 3\u00d73 grid. So the output should have the input pattern in these positions.\n\nLet me construct the output grid:\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707707000\n707707000\n770770000\n\nThis should be the correct output.\n</thinking>\n\nI need to analyze the transformation pattern in these examples.\n\n<thinking>\nLooking at the examples carefully, I notice that the output is always a 9\u00d79 grid, which can be viewed as a 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells.\n\nThe key insight is that the input grid itself determines where copies of itself will appear in the output grid. Specifically:\n- For each non-zero value in the input grid at position (r,c), the entire input grid is copied to the corresponding position in the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nFor example, if input[0][0] is non-zero, then the input grid is copied to the top-left 3\u00d73 cell of the output grid.\n\nLet me verify this with Example 1:\n```\n077\n777\n077\n```\n\nNon-zero positions: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\nSo the input should be copied to: top-center, top-right, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, bottom-center, bottom-right\n\nBut the actual output only has the input in: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left\n\nI need to look more carefully. Let me check if the rule is actually:\n- For each position (r,c) in the input grid with a specific non-zero value (e.g., 7 in Example 1), place the input grid in the corresponding position of the output grid.\n\nFor Example 1, the value is 7, and 7 appears in positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).\nBut the output has the input in positions: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left.\n\nThis doesn't match either. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWhat if we consider the pattern of non-zero values in the input as a \"mask\" that determines where to place the input in the output?\n\nFor Example 1:\n```\n077\n777\n077\n```\n\nIf we view this as a mask, it forms a cross shape. The output has the input in the top-right, middle-center, and bottom-left positions, which also forms a diagonal.\n\nFor Example 2:\n```\n404\n000\n040\n```\n\nThe mask forms a pattern with 4s in the corners and middle-bottom. The output has the input in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-center positions.\n\nI think I see the pattern now! The rule is:\n- For each unique non-zero value v in the input grid:\n  - For each position (r,c) where the input grid has value v:\n    - Place the entire input grid in the position (r,c) of the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nLet me verify this with Example 1:\nInput has 7s at positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).\nOutput should have the input at positions: top-center, top-right, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, bottom-center, bottom-right.\n\nBut the actual output has the input at: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left.\n\nThis still doesn't match. Let me try one more approach.\n\nWhat if the rule is:\n- For each position (r,c) in the input grid:\n  - If the value at position (r,c) is non-zero, then place the entire input grid in the position (c,r) of the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nFor Example 1:\nInput has non-zero values at positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).\nUsing the transposed rule, the input should be placed at positions: (1,0)=middle-top, (2,0)=right-top, (0,1)=left-middle, (1,1)=middle-middle, (2,1)=right-middle, (1,2)=middle-bottom, (2,2)=right-bottom.\n\nBut the actual output has the input at: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left.\n\nI need to look more carefully at the examples.\n\nLet me try a different approach. What if the rule is based on the specific values in the input?\n\nFor Example 1, the input has 7s. If I look at where 7s appear in the input:\n```\n077\n777\n077\n```\n\n7s appear at positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nThe output has the input pattern in positions: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left.\n\nThese positions correspond to (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) in the 3\u00d73 grid.\n\nI notice that these positions form a diagonal in the 3\u00d73 grid. This might be a clue.\n\nLet me check Example 2:\n```\n404\n000\n040\n```\n\n4s appear at positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,1).\n\nThe output has the input pattern in positions: top-left, top-right, bottom-center.\n\nThese positions correspond to (0,0), (0,2), (2,1) in the 3\u00d73 grid.\n\nThis matches exactly! The rule is:\n- For each position (r,c) in the input grid with a specific non-zero value (e.g., 7 in Example 1, 4 in Example 2), place the input grid in the position (r,c) of the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nLet me verify this with the other examples:\n\nExample 3:\n```\n000\n002\n202\n```\n\n2s appear at positions (1,2), (2,0), (2,2).\nOutput has the input at positions: middle-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.\nThese positions correspond to (1,2), (2,0), (2,2) in the 3\u00d73 grid. \u2713\n\nExample 4:\n```\n660\n600\n066\n```\n\n6s appear at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (2,1), (2,2).\nOutput has the input at positions: top-left, top-center, middle-left, bottom-center, bottom-right.\nThese positions correspond to (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (2,1), (2,2) in the 3\u00d73 grid. \u2713\n\nExample 5:\n```\n222\n000\n022\n```\n\n2s appear at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (2,1), (2,2).\nOutput has the input at positions: top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-center, bottom-right.\nThese positions correspond to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (2,1), (2,2) in the 3\u00d73 grid. \u2713\n\nThe rule is confirmed!

The output is always a 9\u00d79 grid, which can be viewed as a 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells.\n2. The rule is: For each position (r,c) in the input grid that contains a non-zero value, place a copy of the entire input grid in the corresponding position of the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nFor example:\n- If input[0][0] is non-zero, place the input in the top-left 3\u00d73 cell of the output\n- If input[1][2] is non-zero, place the input in the middle-right 3\u00d73 cell of the output\n\nLet me apply this to the test input:\n```\n707\n707\n770\n```\n\nNon-zero positions are:\n- (0,0), (0,2): top-left and top-right\n- (1,0), (1,2): middle-left and middle-right\n- (2,0), (2,1): bottom-left and bottom-center\n\nSo I need to place the input grid in these six positions of the output grid.\n\n<answer>\n[[7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7],\n[7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7],\n[7,7,0,0,0,0,7,7,0],\n[7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7],\n[7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7],\n[7,7,0,0,0,0,7,7,0],\n[7,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0],\n[7,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0],\n[7,7,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 561, "completion_tokens": 6302}

Identify distinct patterns in the input (groups of non-zero numbers that are connected)\n2. For each pattern, create multiple copies of it in the output\n3. The copies are placed in specific positions based on the original pattern's position\n\nLet me look more closely at where the copies are placed:\n\nIn Example 1:\n- The 888/808/888 pattern with 3's stays in its original position but the 3's extend to the right\n- The 222 pattern is copied multiple times vertically downward\n\nIn Example 2:\n- The 4 pattern is copied and expanded upward\n- The complex pattern with 1's, 2's, and 4's is copied and expanded horizontally\n\nIn Example 3:\n- The 6 pattern is copied and moved to different positions\n- The 55/50/05 pattern stays in its original position\n- The 11/10 pattern is copied and expanded downward and to the right\n\nI think the rule might be:\n1. Identify each distinct pattern (connected non-zero numbers)\n2. For each pattern, create copies based on the pattern's shape and color\n3. The original pattern stays in place, and copies are positioned in specific directions\n\nFor the test input, I need to:\n1. Identify the patterns: 40/40, 888/808/808 with 2's, and 333\n2. Apply the transformation rule to create copies in appropriate directions\n\nLet me analyze the exact pattern of copying:\n\nIn Example 1:\n- The 888/808/888 pattern with 3's: The 3's extend to the right forming a pattern (3330333)\n- The 222 pattern: Copied 3 times vertically downward with the same pattern (222, 202, 222)\n\nIn Example 2:\n- The 4 pattern: Copied upward forming 444\n- The complex pattern: Copied horizontally to both sides\n\nIn Example 3:\n- The 6 pattern: Copied and moved to different positions\n- The 55/50/05 pattern: Stays in place\n- The 11/10 pattern: Copied downward and to the right\n\nI think I see the pattern now. Each digit in the input creates its own pattern in the output. The digit determines both the shape of the pattern and where copies are placed.\n\nFor example:\n- Digit 2 creates a pattern of 222/202/222 and is copied vertically\n- Digit 3 creates a pattern of 333/303/333 and is copied horizontally\n- Digit 4 creates a pattern of 444/404/444\n- Digit 5 creates its own pattern\n- Digit 6 creates its own pattern\n- Digit 8 stays in place but affects adjacent digits\n\nLet me apply this to the test input:\n- The 40/40 pattern should create copies based on the rule for digit 4\n- The 888/808/808 with 2's should stay in place, but the 2's should extend\n- The 333 pattern should create copies based on the rule for digit 3\n</thinking>\n\n<thinking>\nLet me analyze this more methodically. I need to understand exactly how patterns are transformed from input to output.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n- There's a pattern \"888/808/888\" with \"030/030/030\" to its right\n- In the output, the original pattern stays, but the 3's extend to \"33303330333\"\n- There's a pattern \"222\" in the input\n- In the output, this pattern is repeated vertically as \"222/202/222\" three times\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n- There's a \"4\" at position (5,12)\n- In the output, this becomes a pattern \"444/040/444\" centered at the original position\n- There's a complex pattern with 1's, 2's, and 4's\n- In the output, this pattern is repeated horizontally\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n- There's a \"6/06\" pattern\n- In the output, this becomes several \"66/06/06\" patterns in different locations\n- There's a \"550/505/055\" pattern that stays in place\n- There's a \"11/10\" pattern that becomes several \"11/101/011\" patterns\n\nI think I'm seeing a clearer pattern now:\n1. Each digit in the input creates a specific pattern in the output\n2. The pattern is placed at the original position and possibly copied to other locations\n3. The shape of the pattern depends on the digit\n\nFor digit 3:\n- Creates a horizontal pattern \"333/303/333\"\n\nFor digit 2:\n- Creates a vertical pattern \"222/202/222\"\n\nFor digit 4:\n- Creates a pattern \"444/404/444\"\n\nFor digit 1:\n- Creates a pattern \"11/101/011\"\n\nFor digit 5 and 6:\n- They seem to create their own specific patterns\n\nFor digit 8:\n- Seems to stay in place\n\nLet me apply this understanding to the test input:\n- The 40/40 pattern should create a pattern based on digit 4\n- The 888/808/808 with 20/20/20 should stay in place, but the 2's should extend to form vertical patterns\n- The 333 pattern should create horizontal patterns\n\nLet me be even more precise about the transformation rule:\n1. Each non-zero digit in the input creates a specific pattern in the output\n2. The pattern is centered at the original position of the digit\n3. The shape of the pattern depends on the digit value\n\nLet me check if this rule consistently explains all examples:\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Digit 3 creates horizontal patterns \"333/303/333\"\n- Digit 2 creates vertical patterns \"222/202/222\"\n- Digit 8 stays in place\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Digit 4 creates patterns \"444/404/444\"\n- Digit 1 and 2 create their own patterns\n\nIn Example 3:\n- Digit 6 creates patterns \"66/06/06\"\n- Digit 5 stays in place\n- Digit 1 creates patterns \"11/101/011\"\n\nThis seems consistent. Now I'll apply it to the test input.\n</thinking>\n\n<thinking>\nAfter careful analysis, I believe I've identified the pattern:\n\n1. Each non-zero digit in the input grid creates a specific pattern in the output\n2. The pattern depends on the digit value:\n   - Digit 2: Creates a vertical pattern \"222/202/222\"\n   - Digit 3: Creates a horizontal pattern \"333/303/333\"\n   - Digit 4: Creates a pattern \"444/404/444\" (appears to be both horizontal and vertical)\n   - Other digits have their own patterns\n\n3. The original digits generally stay in place, and the patterns are added to the output\n\nFor the test input, I need to:\n- Keep the 888/808/808 pattern in place\n- Transform the 20/20/20 pattern into vertical \"222/202/222\" patterns\n- Transform the 40/40 pattern into \"444/404/444\" patterns\n- Transform the 333 pattern into horizontal \"333/303/333\" patterns\n\nLet me apply this to the test input grid:\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 1493, "completion_tokens": 2833}

This suggests that we're somehow extracting or computing a 3x3 grid from the 3x7 input grid.\n\nLooking at the patterns, I'm trying to see if there's a relationship between specific positions in the input and the output.\n\nLet me divide each input row into chunks of size 2-3-2:\n- First 2 digits\n- Middle 3 digits\n- Last 2 digits\n\nExample 1:\nInput divided:\n```\n[10] [050] [10]\n[01] [051] [11]\n[10] [050] [00]\n```\nOutput:\n```\n000\n020\n000\n```\n\nExample 2:\nInput divided:\n```\n[11] [050] [10]\n[00] [151] [11]\n[11] [050] [10]\n```\nOutput:\n```\n020\n002\n020\n```\n\nExample 3:\nInput divided:\n```\n[00] [150] [00]\n[11] [051] [01]\n[01] [151] [01]\n```\nOutput:\n```\n000\n200\n002\n```\n\nI'm starting to see a pattern. It seems like the output grid is determined by the middle 3 digits of each input row. Specifically, if the middle digit (the 4th column in the input) is 5, then the corresponding position in the output grid gets a value of 2. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nLet's check this hypothesis:\n\nExample 1:\nMiddle 3 digits: [050], [051], [050]\n4th column values: 5, 5, 5\nOutput: [0,0,0], [0,2,0], [0,0,0]\nThis matches if we put 2 in the middle position of the second row because the 4th column of the second row is 5.\n\nExample 2:\nMiddle 3 digits: [050], [151], [050]\n4th column values: 5, 5, 5\nOutput: [0,2,0], [0,0,2], [0,2,0]\nThis doesn't match our hypothesis exactly.\n\nLet me refine my thinking. It seems like the position of the 5 in the middle 3 digits determines the position of the 2 in the output row.\n\nExample 1:\nMiddle 3 digits: [050], [051], [050]\nPosition of 5: 1st, 1st, 1st (0-indexed)\nOutput rows: [0,0,0], [0,2,0], [0,0,0]\nSo if 5 is in the 1st position (middle), the 2 goes in the 1st position (middle) of the output row.\n\nExample 2:\nMiddle 3 digits: [050], [151], [050]\nPosition of 5: 1st, 2nd, 1st\nOutput rows: [0,2,0], [0,0,2], [0,2,0]\nThis matches! If 5 is in the 2nd position, the 2 goes in the 2nd position of the output row.\n\nExample 3:\nMiddle 3 digits: [150], [051], [151]\nPosition of 5: 0th, 1st, 2nd\nOutput rows: [0,0,0], [2,0,0], [0,0,2]\nThis also matches! If 5 is in the 0th position, the 2 goes in the 0th position of the output row.\n\nSo the rule is: For each row in the input, look at the middle 3 digits (columns 3, 4, and 5, which are indices 2, 3, and 4 in 0-indexed). If there's a 5 in any of these positions, put a 2 in the corresponding position in the output row. Otherwise, put a 0.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n```\n1015101\n0105101\n1015010\n```\n\nDividing into chunks:\n```\n[10] [151] [01]\n[01] [051] [01]\n[10] [150] [10]\n```\n\nMiddle 3 digits: [151], [051], [150]\nPosition of 5: 2nd, 1st, 0th\nOutput rows: [0,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,0]\n\nSo the output grid should be:\n```\n002\n020\n200\n```\n</thinking>\n\nI need to determine the transformation rule by analyzing the examples.\n\n<thinking>\nLooking at the input and output grids, I notice that the input grids are 7 columns wide and 3 rows tall, while the output grids are 3\u00d73.\n\nLet me examine the middle 3 columns (columns 3-5) of each input grid:\n\nExample 1:\nInput middle columns:\n```\n050\n051\n050\n```\nOutput:\n```\n000\n020\n000\n```\n\nExample 2:\nInput middle columns:\n```\n050\n151\n050\n```\nOutput:\n```\n020\n002\n020\n```\n\nExample 3:\nInput middle columns:\n```\n150\n051\n151\n```\nOutput:\n```\n000\n200\n002\n```\n\nI see the pattern! For each row, the position of the \"5\" in the middle three columns determines where a \"2\" appears in the corresponding output row. If the 5 is in the first position of the middle three, a 2 appears in the first position of the output row. If 5 is in the second position, 2 appears in the second position, and if 5 is in the third position, 2 appears in the third position.\n\nLet me verify this with all examples:\n- In Example 1, row 1: 5 is in middle position \u2192 2 is in middle position\n- In Example 2, row 1: 5 is in middle position \u2192 2 is in middle position\n- In Example 2, row 2: 5 is in right position \u2192 2 is in right position\n- In Example 3, row 2: 5 is in left position \u2192 2 is in left position\n- In Example 3, row 3: 5 is in right position \u2192 2 is in right position\n\nThis rule is consistent across all examples.\n</thinking>\n\nNow I'll apply this rule to the test input:\n\n<thinking>\nTest Input:\n```\n1015101\n0105101\n1015010\n```\n\nLet me extract the middle three columns:\n```\n151\n051\n150\n```\n\nApplying the rule:\n- Row 1: 5 is in right position \u2192 2 should be in right position\n- Row 2: 5 is in middle position \u2192 2 should be in middle position\n- Row 3: 5 is in left position \u2192 2 should be in left position\n\nSo the output grid should be:\n```\n002\n020\n200\n```\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0,0,2],\n[0,2,0],\n[2,0,0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 383, "completion_tokens": 1848}

The non-zero digits in the input are 8, 3, 0, and 4.\n\nThe rule seems to be:\n1. Identify all the non-zero digits in the input grid.\n2. Arrange these digits in descending order.\n3. Repeat this sequence to fill the entire output grid, both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's verify this rule with the examples:\n\nExample 1: Non-zero digits are 2, 8, 3. In descending order: 8, 3, 2. The output shows \"283\" repeating, which doesn't match the descending order.\n\nLet me reconsider. Maybe it's not descending order but some other arrangement.\n\nLooking at the input grids more carefully:\n- Example 1: The non-zero digits appear in the order 2, 8, 3 from top-left to bottom-right.\n- Example 2: The non-zero digits appear in the order 1, 2, 4 from top-left to bottom-right.\n- Example 3: The non-zero digits appear in the order 8, 3, 0, 4 from top-left to bottom-right.\n\nBut the output patterns are \"283\", \"241\", and \"483\" respectively.\n\nLet me look more closely at the input grids:\n\nExample 1 Input:\n2830000\n8300000\n3000000\n...\n\nThe first few non-zero digits are 2, 8, 3 in the order they appear from left to right, top to bottom. And the output pattern is \"283\".\n\nExample 2 Input:\n...\n0000001\n0000012\n0000124\n...\n\nThe non-zero digits are 1, 2, 4 in the order they appear. And the output pattern is \"241\".\n\nExample 3 Input:\n...\n0000830\n0008300\n...\n\nThe non-zero digits are 8, 3, 0, 4 in the order they appear. But the output pattern is \"483\".\n\nWait, I think I see the pattern now. The output pattern seems to be derived from the non-zero digits in the input, but in a specific order. Let's check if it's the order of appearance from right to left, bottom to top:\n\nExample 1: Reading from right to left, bottom to top, the first few non-zero digits are 3, 8, 2. The output pattern is \"283\", which is not a match.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's check if the output pattern is derived from the unique non-zero digits in the input:\n\nExample 1: Unique non-zero digits are 2, 8, 3. The output pattern is \"283\".\nExample 2: Unique non-zero digits are 1, 2, 4. The output pattern is \"241\".\nExample 3: Unique non-zero digits are 8, 3, 0, 4. The output pattern is \"483\".\n\nFor Example 3, the unique non-zero digits are 8, 3, 0, 4, but the output pattern is \"483\". This doesn't match.\n\nLet me reconsider once more. Maybe the rule is to take the unique non-zero digits in the order they first appear in the input, and then arrange them in a specific way.\n\nExample 1: First appearances of non-zero digits are 2, 8, 3. The output pattern is \"283\".\nExample 2: First appearances of non-zero digits are 1, 2, 4. The output pattern is \"241\".\nExample 3: First appearances of non-zero digits are 8, 3, 0, 4. The output pattern is \"483\".\n\nFor Example 3, the first appearances are 8, 3, 0, 4, but the output pattern is \"483\". This still doesn't match.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's check if the output pattern is derived from the unique non-zero digits in the input, but in a specific order (e.g., sorted):\n\nExample 1: Unique non-zero digits are 2, 3, 8. Sorted: 2, 3, 8. The output pattern is \"283\".\nExample 2: Unique non-zero digits are 1, 2, 4. Sorted: 1, 2, 4. The output pattern is \"241\".\nExample 3: Unique non-zero digits are 0, 3, 4, 8. Sorted: 0, 3, 4, 8. The output pattern is \"483\".\n\nFor Example 3, the sorted unique non-zero digits are 0, 3, 4, 8, but the output pattern is \"483\". This doesn't match.\n\nLet me take a step back and look at the output patterns more carefully:\n\nExample 1 Output: \"283\" repeating.\nExample 2 Output: \"241\" repeating.\nExample 3 Output: \"483\" repeating.\n\nI notice that in all three examples, the output pattern consists of 3 digits. Let me check if there's a consistent way to derive these 3 digits from the input:\n\nExample 1: Non-zero digits are 2, 8, 3. Output pattern: \"283\".\nExample 2: Non-zero digits are 1, 2, 4. Output pattern: \"241\".\nExample 3: Non-zero digits are 8, 3, 0, 4. Output pattern: \"483\".\n\nFor Example 3, if we exclude 0 (since it's technically \"zero\"), the non-zero digits are 8, 3, 4. But the output pattern is \"483\", which is a rearrangement of these digits.\n\nLet's check if the output pattern is derived from the unique non-zero digits in the input, but in descending order:\n\nExample 1: Unique non-zero digits are 2, 3, 8. Descending: 8, 3, 2. The output pattern is \"283\".\nExample 2: Unique non-zero digits are 1, 2, 4. Descending: 4, 2, 1. The output pattern is \"241\".\nExample 3: Unique non-zero digits are 0, 3, 4, 8. Descending (excluding 0): 8, 4, 3. The output pattern is \"483\".\n\nFor Example 3, the descending unique non-zero digits are 8, 4, 3, and the output pattern is \"483\". This is a match!\n\nSo, the rule seems to be:\n1. Identify all the unique non-zero digits in the input grid.\n2. Arrange these digits in descending order.\n3. Repeat this sequence to fill the entire output grid, both horizontally and vertically.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n0100002\n1000020\n0000200\n0002000\n0020000\n0200004\n2000040\n\nUnique non-zero digits: 1, 2, 4\nArranged in descending order: 4, 2, 1\n\nSo, the output pattern should be \"421\" repeating horizontally and vertically.\n</thinking>\n\nI need to determine the transformation rule by analyzing the provided examples.\n\n<thinking>\nLet me analyze the examples to find the pattern:\n\nExample 1:\nInput has non-zero digits: 2, 8, 3\nOutput shows a repeating pattern: 283283...\n\nExample 2:\nInput has non-zero digits: 1, 2, 4\nOutput shows a repeating pattern: 241241...\n\nExample 3:\nInput has non-zero digits: 8, 3, 0, 4\nOutput shows a repeating pattern: 483483...\n\nI notice that in each case, the output is a repeating pattern of the unique non-zero digits from the input, but arranged in a specific order. Looking at all examples:\n\nExample 1: Non-zero digits (2,8,3) \u2192 Output pattern \"283\"\nExample 2: Non-zero digits (1,2,4) \u2192 Output pattern \"241\"\nExample 3: Non-zero digits (8,3,0,4) \u2192 Output pattern \"483\" (note: 0 is excluded)\n\nThe pattern seems to be arranging the unique non-zero digits in descending order:\n- Example 1: 8,3,2 \u2192 \"283\" (reversed for some reason)\n- Example 2: 4,2,1 \u2192 \"241\" (this matches descending order)\n- Example 3: 8,4,3 \u2192 \"483\" (this matches descending order)\n\nExample 1 doesn't follow the descending order pattern exactly, but Examples 2 and 3 do. Let me check if there's another consistent pattern...\n\nWait, I see it now. The pattern is:\n1. Take the unique non-zero digits from the input\n2. Arrange them in descending order\n3. Reverse this sequence\n4. Repeat this pattern to fill the entire 7\u00d77 grid\n\nThis works for all examples:\n- Example 1: 8,3,2 \u2192 reverse \u2192 \"283\"\n- Example 2: 4,2,1 \u2192 reverse \u2192 \"241\"\n- Example 3: 8,4,3 \u2192 reverse \u2192 \"483\"\n</thinking>\n\nAfter analyzing the examples, I've identified the transformation rule:\n\n1. Identify all unique non-zero digits in the input grid\n2. Arrange these digits in descending order\n3. Reverse this sequence to get the pattern\n4. Fill the entire 7\u00d77 output grid by repeating this pattern both horizontally and vertically\n\nFor the test input:\n```\n0100002\n1000020\n0000200\n0002000\n0020000\n0200004\n2000040\n```\n\nThe unique non-zero digits are: 1, 2, 4\nIn descending order: 4, 2, 1\nReversed: 1, 2, 4\n\nTherefore, the output grid will have the pattern \"124\" repeating horizontally and vertically.\n\n<answer>\n[[1,2,4,1,2,4,1],\n[2,4,1,2,4,1,2],\n[4,1,2,4,1,2,4],\n[1,2,4,1,2,4,1],\n[2,4,1,2,4,1,2],\n[4,1,2,4,1,2,4],\n[1,2,4,1,2,4,1]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 513, "completion_tokens": 2703}

{"task_id": "06df4c85", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet", "raw_response": "<thinking>\nLet me analyze the examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the structure of the grids. I notice that each grid has a pattern of:\n- Two rows of background (mostly 0s with some pattern)\n- One row of a separator (all the same number, like 8s or 1s or 4s)\n- This pattern repeats\n\nSo each grid has \"blocks\" separated by rows of the same number (8s, 1s, or 4s).\n\nNow, let's look at the transformation from input to output in each example:\n\nExample 1:\n- The grid is divided into blocks by rows of 8s.\n- In the output, some blocks have patterns that are \"spread\" horizontally.\n- For instance, in the 2nd block (rows 4-5), the pattern \"822\" in the input appears multiple times in the output.\n- Similarly, in the 5th block (rows 13-14), the pattern \"833\" is repeated.\n\nExample 2:\n- The grid is divided by rows of 1s.\n- Similar spreading of patterns, but with different numbers (122, 199, 188).\n\nExample 3:\n- The grid is divided by rows of 4s.\n- Again, patterns like 433, 422 are spread horizontally.\n\nI think the rule is: For each block (between separator rows), if there's a pattern (a sequence of non-background numbers) in the input, it gets repeated horizontally across the entire block in the output.\n\nLet me verify this with a few specific blocks:\n\nExample 1, Block 2 (rows 4-5):\n- Input: 00822800800800822800\n- Output: 00822822822822822800\nThe pattern \"822\" from the left is repeated across the block.\n\nExample 2, Block 4 (rows 10-11):\n- Input: 00100100199100100100199\n- Output: 00122100199199199199199\nThe pattern \"199\" is repeated, and the \"122\" from an earlier block is also maintained.\n\nExample 3, Block 4 (rows 10-11):\n- Input: 00400400422400400422400\n- Output: 00433400422422422422400\nThe pattern \"422\" is repeated, and the \"433\" from an earlier block is maintained.\n\nI'm noticing another pattern: patterns from earlier blocks seem to be \"remembered\" and applied to later blocks. For example, in Example 2, the \"122\" pattern from Block 2 is applied to Blocks 3, 4, and 5.\n\nLet me refine my understanding:\n\n1. The grid is divided into blocks by separator rows.\n2. Each block can have its own pattern (a sequence of non-background numbers).\n3. If a block has a pattern, it gets repeated horizontally across that block in the output.\n4. Patterns from earlier blocks are \"remembered\" and applied to subsequent blocks, unless a new pattern is introduced in that block.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input:\n\nThe test input has blocks separated by rows of 4s. Let's identify the patterns in each block:\n\nBlock 1 (rows 1-2): No pattern, just background.\nBlock 2 (rows 4-5): Patterns \"488\" and \"422\".\nBlock 3 (rows 7-8): No new pattern.\nBlock 4 (rows 10-11): Pattern \"433\".\nBlock 5 (rows 13-14): Pattern \"488\" (already seen).\nBlock 6 (rows 16-17): No new pattern.\nBlock 7 (rows 19-20): Pattern \"422\" (already seen).\nBlock 8 (rows 22-23): No new pattern.\nBlock 9 (rows 25-26): No new pattern.\n\nNow, let's apply the transformation:\n\nBlock 1: No change.\nBlock 2: Repeat \"488\" and \"422\" horizontally.\nBlock 3: Apply patterns from Block 2.\nBlock 4: Repeat \"433\" horizontally and apply patterns from Block 2.\nBlock 5: Apply patterns from Block 2 and Block 4.\nBlock 6: Apply patterns from Block 2 and Block 4.\nBlock 7: Apply patterns from Block 2 and Block 4.\nBlock 8: Apply patterns from Block 2 and Block 4.\nBlock 9: Apply patterns from Block 2 and Block 4.\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Let me look at the examples again to understand how patterns are propagated.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Block 2 introduces \"822\".\n- Block 3 introduces \"811\".\n- Block 4 has \"822\" (already seen).\n- Block 5 introduces \"833\".\n- In the output, each block has its own pattern repeated horizontally.\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Block 2 introduces \"122\" and \"144\".\n- Block 3 has no new pattern, but in the output, \"122\" from Block 2 is applied.\n- Block 4 introduces \"199\". In the output, \"122\" is maintained and \"199\" is repeated.\n- Block 5 introduces \"188\". In the output, \"122\" is maintained and \"188\" is applied.\n- Block 6 has \"122\" (already seen). In the output, \"122\" is maintained and \"188\" from Block 5 is applied.\n- Block 7 introduces \"188\" (already seen). In the output, all patterns are repeated.\n\nIn Example 3:\n- Block 2 introduces \"433\" and \"422\".\n- Block 3 has no new pattern, but in the output, \"433\" from Block 2 is applied.\n- Block 4 introduces \"422\" (already seen). In the output, \"433\" is maintained and \"422\" is repeated.\n- Block 5 has no new pattern, but in the output, \"433\" is maintained.\n- Block 6 has no new pattern, but in the output, \"433\" is maintained.\n- Block 7 introduces \"433\" (already seen). In the output, \"433\" is repeated.\n\nI think I understand the rule better now:\n\n1. The grid is divided into blocks by separator rows.\n2. Each block can have its own pattern (a sequence of non-background numbers).\n3. If a block has a pattern, it gets repeated horizontally across that block in the output.\n4. Patterns from earlier blocks are \"remembered\" and applied to subsequent blocks, unless a new pattern is introduced in that block.\n5. If a block has multiple patterns, all of them are repeated horizontally.\n\nLet me apply this to the test input:\n\nBlock 1 (rows 1-2): No pattern, just background.\nBlock 2 (rows 4-5): Patterns \"488\" and \"422\".\nBlock 3 (rows 7-8): No new pattern, apply \"488\" and \"422\" from Block 2.\nBlock 4 (rows 10-11): Pattern \"433\". Apply \"488\" and \"422\" from Block 2 and repeat \"433\".\nBlock 5 (rows 13-14): Pattern \"488\" (already seen). Apply \"488\", \"422\", and \"433\" from previous blocks.\nBlock 6 (rows 16-17): No new pattern, apply patterns from previous blocks.\nBlock 7 (rows 19-20): Pattern \"422\" (already seen). Apply all patterns from previous blocks.\nBlock 8 (rows 22-23): No new pattern, apply patterns from previous blocks.\nBlock 9 (rows 25-26): No new pattern, apply patterns from previous blocks.\n\nActually, I think I'm still missing something. Let me look at the examples more carefully.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Block 2 introduces \"822\" at positions 4-6 and 16-18. In the output, \"822\" is repeated at positions 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-15, 16-18.\n- Block 3 introduces \"811\" at positions 10-12. In the output, \"811\" is at positions 10-12, and \"822\" from Block 2 is at positions 16-18.\n- Block 4 has \"822\" at positions 16-18. In the output, \"822\" is at positions 16-18.\n- Block 5 introduces \"833\" at positions 4-6 and 10-12. In the output, \"833\" is repeated at positions 4-6, 7-9, 10-12.\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Block 2 introduces \"122\" at positions 4-6 and \"144\" at positions 10-12. In the output, they remain at their positions.\n- Block 3 has no new pattern. In the output, \"122\" from Block 2 is applied at positions 4-6.\n- Block 4 introduces \"199\" at positions 10-12 and 19-21. In the output, \"122\" is at positions 4-6 and \"199\" is repeated at positions 10-12, 13-15, 16-18, 19-21, 22-24.\n- Block 5 introduces \"188\" at positions 19-21. In the output, \"122\" is at positions 4-6 and \"188\" is at positions 19-21.\n- Block 6 has \"122\" at positions 4-6. In the output, \"122\" is at positions 4-6 and \"188\" from Block 5 is at positions 19-21.\n- Block 7 introduces \"188\" at positions 10-12 and 19-21. In the output, \"188\" is repeated at positions 10-12, 13-15, 16-18, 19-21.\n\nI think I'm getting closer. The rule seems to be:\n\n1. The grid is divided into blocks by separator rows.\n2. Each block can have its own pattern (a sequence of non-background numbers).\n3. If a block has a pattern, it gets repeated horizontally across that block in the output, starting from the leftmost occurrence of that pattern.\n4. Patterns from earlier blocks are \"remembered\" and applied to subsequent blocks at the same positions, unless a new pattern is introduced at those positions.\n\nLet me apply this to the test input:\n\nBlock 1 (rows 1-2): No pattern, just background.\nBlock 2 (rows 4-5): Patterns \"488\" at positions 7-9 and \"422\" at positions 16-18.\nBlock 3 (rows 7-8): No new pattern, apply \"488\" at positions 7-9 and \"422\" at positions 16-18.\nBlock 4 (rows 10-11): Pattern \"433\" at positions 22-24. Apply \"488\" at positions 7-9 and \"422\" at positions 16-18.\nBlock 5 (rows 13-14): Pattern \"488\" at positions 7-9. Apply \"422\" at positions 16-18 and \"433\" at positions 22-24.\nBlock 6 (rows 16-17): No new pattern, apply \"488\" at positions 7-9, \"422\" at positions 16-18, and \"433\" at positions 22-24.\nBlock 7 (rows 19-20): Pattern \"422\" at positions 4-6 and 16-18. Apply \"488\" at positions 7-9 and \"433\" at positions 22-24.\nBlock 8 (rows 22-23): No new pattern, apply \"422\" at positions 4-6, \"488\" at positions 7-9, \"422\" at positions 16-18, and \"433\" at positions 22-24.\nBlock 9 (rows 25-26): No new pattern, apply all patterns from previous blocks.\n\nWait, I think I'm still not getting it right. Let me try one more approach.\n\nLet's look at Example 3 in detail:\n\nBlock 1 (rows 1-2): No pattern, just background.\nBlock 2 (rows 4-5): Patterns \"433\" at positions 4-6 and \"422\" at positions 16-18.

In the output, \"433\" from Block 2 is applied at positions 4-6.\nBlock 4 (rows 10-11): Pattern \"422\" at positions 10-12 and 19-21. In the output, \"433\" from Block 2 is at positions 4-6, and \"422\" is repeated at positions 10-12, 13-15, 16-18, 19-21.\nBlock 5 (rows 13-14): No new pattern. In the output, \"433\" from Block 2 is at positions 4-6.\nBlock 6 (rows 16-17): No new pattern.

In the output, \"433\" is repeated at positions 4-6, 7-9, 10-12, 13-15, 16-18, 19-21.\n\nI think I understand now:\n\n1. The grid is divided into blocks by separator rows.\n2. Each block can have its own pattern (a sequence of non-background numbers).\n3. If a block has a pattern (e.g., \"433\"), it gets repeated horizontally across that block in the output, starting from the leftmost occurrence of that pattern.\n4. Patterns from earlier blocks are \"remembered\" and applied to subsequent blocks at the same positions, unless a new pattern is introduced at those positions or the same pattern appears again in the block.\n5. If a pattern appears again in a later block, it gets repeated horizontally across that block in the output.\n\nLet me apply this to the test input:\n\nBlock 1 (rows 1-2): No pattern, just background.\nBlock 2 (rows 4-5): Patterns \"488\" at positions 7-9 and \"422\" at positions 16-18.

The 5s in the input are being transformed into different numbers in the output.\n2. It seems like the transformation depends on the position of the 5 in the grid.\n\nLet me analyze the pattern more carefully:\n- In Example 1, 5s in the leftmost column become 2s\n- In Example 1, 5s in the middle column become 3s\n- In Example 1, 5s in the rightmost column become 4s\n- In Example 1, isolated 5s in the top row become 1s\n\n- In Example 2, 5s in the leftmost column become 4s\n- In Example 2, 5s in the middle column become 2s\n- In Example 2, 5s in the rightmost column become 1s\n- In Example 2, 5s in the middle of the grid become 3s\n\nI think I see the pattern. The transformation is based on the position of the 5 relative to the grid:\n- 5s in the first column (from left) become 2s in Example 1 and 4s in Example 2\n- 5s in the second column (from left) become 3s in Example 1 and 2s in Example 2\n- 5s in the third column (from left) become 4s in Example 1 and 1s in Example 2\n\nWait, this doesn't seem consistent. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLooking more carefully, I think the rule might be:\n- 5s in the leftmost column of 5s become 2s\n- 5s in the middle column of 5s become 3s\n- 5s in the rightmost column of 5s become 4s\n- Isolated 5s (not part of a column) become 1s\n\nLet me check this against the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n- Leftmost column of 5s (positions (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), etc.) \u2192 2s \u2713\n- Middle column of 5s (positions (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), etc.) \u2192 3s \u2713\n- Rightmost column of 5s (positions (6,3), (7,3), (8,3)) \u2192 4s \u2713\n- Isolated 5 at (0,5) \u2192 1 \u2713\n\nExample 2:\n- Leftmost column of 5s (positions (7,0), (8,0)) \u2192 4s \u2713\n- Middle column of 5s (positions (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), etc.) \u2192 2s \u2713\n- Rightmost column of 5s (positions (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), etc.) \u2192 1s \u2713\n- Isolated 5 at position (5,3) \u2192 3 \u2713\n\nI think I've got it. The rule is:\n1. Identify all columns of 5s in the grid\n2. The leftmost column of 5s becomes 2s\n3. The middle column of 5s becomes 3s\n4. The rightmost column of 5s becomes 4s\n5. Any isolated 5 (not part of a column) becomes 1\n\nNow let's apply this to the test input:\n\n```\n000000000\n050000000\n050005000\n050005000\n050005050\n050005050\n050505050\n050505050\n050505050\n```\n\nI need to identify the columns of 5s:\n- Leftmost column: positions (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1)\n- Middle column: positions (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3)\n- Rightmost column: positions (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5)\n\nSo:\n- Leftmost column of 5s \u2192 2s\n- Middle column of 5s \u2192 3s\n- Rightmost column of 5s \u2192 4s\n\nLet me create the output grid:\n```\n000000000\n020000000\n020003000\n020003000\n020003040\n020003040\n020303040\n020303040\n020303040\n```\n\nActually, let me double-check my understanding. I think I misunderstood the grid format. The grid is represented as rows, and each digit represents a cell. So the first row is \"000005000\", the second row is \"050005000\", etc.\n\nLet me reanalyze with this understanding:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n```\n000005000\n050005000\n050005000\n050505000\n050505000\n050505000\n050505050\n050505050\n050505050\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n000001000\n020001000\n020001000\n020301000\n020301000\n020301000\n020301040\n020301040\n020301040\n```\n\nI see three columns of 5s:\n- Left column (positions (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), etc.) \u2192 2s\n- Middle column (positions (0,5), (1,5), (2,5), etc.) \u2192 1s\n- Right column (positions (6,8), (7,8), (8,8)) \u2192 4s\n- The 5s at positions (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), etc. \u2192 3s\n\nThis doesn't match my previous pattern. Let me reconsider.\n\nI think the rule might be based on the position of the 5 in the grid, regardless of other 5s:\n- 5s in column 0 \u2192 ?\n- 5s in column 1 \u2192 2\n- 5s in column 3 \u2192 3\n- 5s in column 5 \u2192 1\n- 5s in column 8 \u2192 4\n\nLet me check Example 2 to see if this holds:\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n```\n000000000\n000000050\n000000050\n000000050\n000500050\n000505050\n000505050\n050505050\n050505050\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n000000000\n000000010\n000000010\n000000010\n000200010\n000203010\n000203010\n040203010\n040203010\n```\n\n- 5s in column 0 \u2192 4\n- 5s in column 3 \u2192 2\n- 5s in column 4 \u2192 3\n- 5s in column 7 \u2192 1\n\nThis doesn't match the pattern from Example 1. Let me try again.\n\nI think I need to consider the columns of 5s in each example separately:\n\nExample 1:\n- Leftmost column of 5s (column 1) \u2192 2\n- Middle column of 5s (column 3) \u2192 3\n- Rightmost column of 5s (column 5) \u2192 1\n- Isolated column of 5s (column 8) \u2192 4\n\nExample 2:\n- Leftmost column of 5s (column 0) \u2192 4\n- Second column of 5s (column 3) \u2192 2\n- Third column of 5s (column 4) \u2192 3\n- Rightmost column of 5s (column 7) \u2192 1\n\nNow I see a pattern! The columns of 5s are numbered from right to left, and:\n- Rightmost column of 5s \u2192 1\n- Second column from right \u2192 2\n- Third column from right \u2192 3\n- Fourth column from right (if exists) \u2192 4\n\nLet's apply this to the test input:\n\n```\n000000000\n050000000\n050005000\n050005000\n050005050\n050005050\n050505050\n050505050\n050505050\n```\n\nI see three columns of 5s:\n- Column 1 (leftmost)\n- Column 3 (middle)\n- Column 5 (rightmost)\n\nNumbering from right to left:\n- Column 5 (rightmost) \u2192 1\n- Column 3 (second from right) \u2192 2\n- Column 1 (third from right) \u2192 3\n\nSo the transformation should be:\n- 5s in column 1 \u2192 3\n- 5s in column 3 \u2192 2\n- 5s in column 5 \u2192 1\n\nLet me create the output grid:\n```\n000000000\n030000000\n030002000\n030002000\n030002010\n030002010\n030202010\n030202010\n030202010\n```\n\nLet me double-check this against the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n- Rightmost column (column 8) \u2192 1 \u2717 (it's 4 in the output)\n- Second from right (column 5) \u2192 2 \u2717 (it's 1 in the output)\n- Third from right (column 3) \u2192 3 \u2713\n- Fourth from right (column 1) \u2192 4 \u2717 (it's 2 in the output)\n\nThis doesn't match. Let me try once more.\n\nI think I need to consider the columns where 5s appear, and number them from left to right:\n- First column with 5s (leftmost) \u2192 2\n- Second column with 5s \u2192 3\n- Third column with 5s \u2192 4\n- Fourth column with 5s \u2192 1\n\nLet me check Example 1:\n- First column with 5s (column 1) \u2192 2 \u2713\n- Second column with 5s (column 3) \u2192 3 \u2713\n- Third column with 5s (column 5) \u2192 1 \u2717 (should be 4)\n- Fourth column with 5s (column 8) \u2192 4 \u2717 (should be 1)\n\nThis still doesn't match. Let me try another approach.\n\nI think the key is to look at the grid as a whole and identify the pattern of 5s. Let me try again:\n\nExample 1:\n- The 5 at position (0,5) becomes 1\n- The column of 5s at positions (1,1), (2,1), etc. becomes 2\n- The column of 5s at positions (3,3), (4,3), etc. becomes 3\n- The column of 5s at positions (6,8), (7,8), (8,8) becomes 4\n\nExample 2:\n- The column of 5s at positions (1,7), (2,7), (3,7) becomes 1\n- The column of 5s at positions (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) becomes 2\n- The 5 at position (5,4) becomes 3\n- The column of 5s at positions (7,0), (8,0) becomes 4\n\nI think I see it now. The rule is:\n1. Identify all columns where 5s appear\n2. Number these columns from left to right (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)\n3. Transform 5s based on their column number:\n   - Column 1 (leftmost) \u2192 2\n   - Column 2 \u2192 3\n   - Column 3 \u2192 1\n   - Column 4 \u2192 4\n\nLet me check this against the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n- Column 1 (column 1) \u2192 2 \u2713\n- Column 2 (column 3) \u2192 3 \u2713\n- Column 3 (column 5) \u2192 1 \u2713\n- Column 4 (column 8) \u2192 4 \u2713\n\nExample 2:\n- Column 1 (column 0) \u2192 2 \u2717 (it's 4 in the output)\n- Column 2 (column 3) \u2192 3 \u2717 (it's 2 in the output)\n- Column 3 (column 4) \u2192 1 \u2717 (it's 3 in the output)\n- Column 4 (column 7) \u2192 4 \u2717 (it's 1 in the output)\n\nThis doesn't match Example 2. Let me try again.\n\nWait, I think I see it. The rule might be:\n1. Identify all columns where 5s appear\n2. Number these columns from right to left (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)\n3. Transform 5s based on their column number:\n   - Column 1 (rightmost) \u2192 1\n   - Column 2 \u2192 2\n   - Column 3 \u2192 3\n   - Column 4 \u2192 4\n\nLet me check this against the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n- Column 1 (column 8) \u2192 1 \u2717 (it's 4 in the output)\n- Column 2 (column 5) \u2192 2 \u2717 (it's 1 in the output)\n- Column 3 (column 3) \u2192 3 \u2713\n- Column 4 (column 1) \u2192 4 \u2717 (it's 2 in the output)\n\nThis doesn't match either. Let me try again.\n\nI think I need to be more careful about how I'm counting columns. Let me list the exact columns where 5s appear in each example:\n\nExample 1:\n- Column 1: positions (1,1), (2,1), etc.\n- Column 3: positions (3,3), (4,3), etc.\n- Column 5: positions (0,5), (1,5), etc.\n- Column 8: positions (6,8), (7,8), (8,8)\n\nThese columns with 5s transform to:\n- Column 1 \u2192 2\n- Column 3 \u2192 3\n- Column 5 \u2192 1\n- Column 8 \u2192 4\n\nExample 2:\n- Column 0: positions (7,0), (8,0)\n- Column 3: positions (4,3), (5,3), (6,3)\n- Column 4: positions (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4)\n- Column 7: positions (1,7), (2,7), (3,7), (4,7), (5,7), (6,7), (7,7), (8,7)\n\nThese columns with 5s transform to:\n- Column 0 \u2192 4\n- Column 3 \u2192 2\n- Column 4 \u2192 3\n- Column 7 \u2192 1\n\nI think I see the pattern now. The transformation is:\n- The rightmost column with 5s \u2192 1\n- The second rightmost column with 5s \u2192 2\n- The third rightmost column with 5s \u2192 3\n- The fourth rightmost column with 5s (if it exists) \u2192 4\n\nLet me check this:\n\nExample 1:\n- Rightmost column with 5s (column 8) \u2192 1 \u2717 (it's 4 in the output)\n- Second rightmost column with 5s (column 5) \u2192 2 \u2717 (it's 1 in the output)\n- Third rightmost column with 5s (column 3) \u2192 3 \u2713\n- Fourth rightmost column with 5s (column 1) \u2192 4 \u2717 (it's 2 in the output)\n\nThis still doesn't match. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me try to map the columns directly:\n\nExample 1:\n- Column 1 \u2192 2\n- Column 3 \u2192 3\n- Column 5 \u2192 1\n- Column 8 \u2192 4\n\nExample 2:\n- Column 0 \u2192 4\n- Column 3 \u2192 2\n- Column 4 \u2192 3\n- Column 7 \u2192 1\n\nI don't see a clear pattern in the column mappings. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern based on the number of 5s in each column:\n\nExample 1:\n- Column 1: 8 fives \u2192 2\n- Column 3: 6 fives \u2192 3\n- Column 5: 9 fives \u2192 1\n- Column 8: 3 fives \u2192 4\n\nExample 2:\n- Column 0: 2 fives \u2192 4\n- Column 3: 3 fives \u2192 2\n- Column 4: 4 fives \u2192 3\n- Column 7: 8 fives \u2192 1\n\nI don't see a clear pattern based on the number of 5s either.\n\nLet me try one more approach. Maybe the rule is based on the relative positions of the columns, regardless of their actual indices:\n\nExample 1:\n- Leftmost column with 5s \u2192 2\n- Second column from left with 5s \u2192 3\n- Third column from left with 5s \u2192 1\n- Rightmost column with 5s \u2192 4\n\nExample 2:\n- Leftmost column with 5s \u2192 4\n- Second column from left with 5s \u2192 2\n- Third column from left with 5s \u2192 3\n- Rightmost column with 5s \u2192 1\n\nThis seems promising! Let me check if this pattern holds:\n\nExample 1:\n- Leftmost column with 5s (column 1) \u2192 2 \u2713\n- Second column from left with 5s (column 3) \u2192 3 \u2713\n- Third column from left with 5s (column 5) \u2192 1 \u2713\n- Rightmost column with 5s (column 8) \u2192 4 \u2713\n\nExample 2:\n- Leftmost column with 5s (column 0) \u2192 4 \u2713\n- Second column from left with 5s (column 3) \u2192 2 \u2713\n- Third column from left with 5s (column 4) \u2192 3 \u2713\n- Rightmost column with 5s (column 7) \u2192 1 \u2713\n\nGreat! This pattern holds for both examples. The rule is:\n1. Identify all columns where 5s appear\n2. Order these columns from left to right\n3. Transform 5s based on their column's position in this ordering:\n   - Leftmost column with 5s \u2192 2 (if there's only one column, it's 1)\n   - Second column from left with 5s \u2192 3\n   - Third column from left with 5s \u2192 1\n   - Rightmost column with 5s (if there are 4 or more) \u2192 4\n\nNow let's apply this to the test input:\n\n```\n000000000\n050000000\n050005000\n050005000\n050005050\n050005050\n050505050\n050505050\n050505050\n```\n\nI see three columns with 5s:\n- Column 1: positions (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1)\n- Column 3: positions (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3)\n- Column 5: positions (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5)\n\nApplying the rule:\n- Leftmost column with 5s (column 1) \u2192 2\n- Second column from left with 5s (column 3) \u2192 3\n- Third column from left with 5s (column 5) \u2192 1\n\nSo the transformation should be:\n- 5s in column 1 \u2192 2\n- 5s in column 3 \u2192 3\n- 5s in column 5 \u2192 1\n\nLet me create the output grid:\n```\n000000000\n020000000\n020003000\n020003000\n020003010\n020003010\n020303010\n020303010\n020303010\n```\n\nLet me double-check this against the examples one more time:\n\nExample 1:\n- Leftmost column with 5s (column 1) \u2192 2 \u2713\n- Second column from left with 5s (column 3) \u2192 3 \u2713\n- Third column from left with 5s (column 5) \u2192 1 \u2713\n- Rightmost column with 5s (column 8) \u2192 4 \u2713\n\nExample 2:\n- Leftmost column with 5s (column 0) \u2192 4 \u2713\n- Second column from left with 5s (column 3) \u2192 2 \u2713\n- Third column from left with 5s (column 4) \u2192 3 \u2713\n- Rightmost column with 5s (column 7) \u2192 1 \u2713\n\nWait, I think I made an error in my analysis. Let me recheck:\n\nExample 1:\n- Columns with 5s: 1, 3, 5, 8\n- Column 1 \u2192 2 \u2713\n- Column 3 \u2192 3 \u2713\n- Column 5 \u2192 1 \u2713\n- Column 8 \u2192 4 \u2713\n\nExample 2:\n- Columns with 5s: 0, 3, 4, 7\n- Column 0 \u2192 4 \u2713\n- Column 3 \u2192 2 \u2713\n- Column 4 \u2192 3 \u2713\n- Column 7 \u2192 1 \u2713\n\nI think I was right before. The rule is:\n1. Identify all columns where 5s appear\n2. Order these columns from left to right\n3. Transform 5s based on their column's position in this ordering:\n   - Leftmost column with 5s \u2192 4 (if there are 4 columns)\n   - Second column from left with 5s \u2192 2\n   - Third column from left with 5s \u2192 3\n   - Rightmost column with 5s \u2192 1\n\nBut wait, this doesn't match Example 1. Let me recheck:\n\nExample 1:\n- Columns with 5s: 1, 3, 5, 8\n- Column 1 \u2192 2\n- Column 3 \u2192 3\n- Column 5 \u2192 1\n- Column 8 \u2192 4\n\nExample 2:\n- Columns with 5s: 0, 3, 4, 7\n- Column 0 \u2192 4\n- Column 3 \u2192 2\n- Column 4 \u2192 3\n- Column 7 \u2192 1\n\nI think the pattern is:\n- First column from left \u2192 4 (if there are 4 columns) or 2 (if there are 3 columns)\n- Second column from left \u2192 2 (if there are 4 columns) or 3 (if there are 3 columns)\n- Third column from left \u2192 3 (if there are 4 columns) or 1 (if there are 3 columns)\n- Fourth column from left \u2192 1\n\nLet me check this:\n\nExample 1 (4 columns with 5s):\n- First column from left (column 1) \u2192 2 \u2717 (should be 4)\n- Second column from left (column 3) \u2192 3 \u2717 (should be 2)\n- Third column from left (column 5) \u2192 1 \u2717 (should be 3)\n- Fourth column from left (column 8) \u2192 4 \u2717 (should be 1)\n\nThis doesn't match. Let me try again.\n\nI think I need to be more careful about the exact transformation. Let me list the exact transformations for each example:\n\nExample 1:\n- Column 1 \u2192 2\n- Column 3 \u2192 3\n- Column 5 \u2192 1\n- Column 8 \u2192 4\n\nExample 2:\n- Column 0 \u2192 4\n- Column 3 \u2192 2\n- Column 4 \u2192 3\n- Column 7 \u2192 1\n\nI don't see a clear pattern based on the column indices. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern based on the position of the columns:\n\nExample 1:\n- Leftmost column with 5s \u2192 2\n- Second column from left with 5s \u2192 3\n- Third column from left with 5s \u2192 1\n- Rightmost column with 5s \u2192 4\n\nExample 2:\n- Leftmost column with 5s \u2192 4\n- Second column from left with 5s \u2192 2\n- Third column from left with 5s \u2192 3\n- Rightmost column with 5s \u2192 1\n\nI think I see it now. The pattern depends on the number of columns with 5s:\n\nIf there are 4 columns with 5s:\n- Leftmost column with 5s \u2192 4\n- Second column from left with 5s \u2192 2\n- Third column from left with 5s \u2192 3\n- Rightmost column with 5s \u2192 1\n\nIf there are 3 columns with 5s:\n- Leftmost column with 5s \u2192 2\n- Second column from left with 5s \u2192 3\n- Rightmost column with 5s \u2192 1\n\nLet me check this:\n\nExample 1 (4 columns with 5s):\n- Leftmost column with 5s (column 1) \u2192 2 \u2717 (should be 4)\n- Second column from left with 5s (column 3) \u2192 3 \u2717 (should be 2)\n- Third column from left with 5s (column 5) \u2192 1 \u2717 (should be 3)\n- Rightmost column with 5s (column 8) \u2192 4 \u2717 (should be 1)\n\nThis doesn't match.

Let me recheck:\n\nExample 1:\n```\n000005000\n050005000\n050005000\n050505000\n050505000\n050505000\n050505050\n050505050\n050505050\n```\n\nIn this grid, the 5s appear in columns 1, 3, 5, and 8.\n\nExample 2:\n```\n000000000\n000000050\n000000050\n000000050\n000500050\n000505050\n000505050\n050505050\n050505050\n```\n\nIn this grid, the 5s appear in columns 0, 3, 4, and 7.\n\nTest Input:\n```\n000000000\n050000000\n050005000\n050005000\n050005050\n050005050\n050505050\n050505050\n050505050\n```\n\nIn this grid, the 5s appear in columns 1, 3, 5, and 8.\n\nI think the rule is:\n- 5s in column 0 \u2192 4\n- 5s in column 1 \u2192 2\n- 5s in column 3 \u2192 3 (if it's in Example 1) or 2 (if it's in Example 2)\n- 5s in column 4 \u2192 3\n- 5s in column 5 \u2192 1\n- 5s in column 7 \u2192 1\n- 5s in column 8 \u2192 4\n\nFor the test input, the columns with 5s are 1, 3, 5, and 8. Applying the rule:\n- 5s in column 1 \u2192 2\n- 5s in column 3 \u2192 3\n- 5s in column 5 \u2192 1\n- 5s in column 8 \u2192 4\n\nSo the transformation should be:\n```\n000000000\n020000000\n020003000\n020003000\n020003010\n020003010\n020303010\n020303010\n020303040\n```\n\nWait, I made an error in my analysis.

But column 8 only has 5s in rows 4-8, not in row 9. Let me recheck:\n\nRow 0: 000000000 (no 5s)\nRow 1: 050000000 (column 1)\nRow 2: 050005000 (columns 1, 5)\nRow 3: 050005000 (columns 1, 5)\nRow 4: 050005050 (columns 1, 5, 8)\nRow 5: 050005050 (columns 1, 5, 8)\nRow 6: 050505050 (columns 1, 3, 5, 8)\nRow 7: 050505050 (columns 1, 3, 5, 8)\nRow 8: 050505050 (columns 1, 3, 5, 8)\n\nSo the columns with 5s are 1, 3, 5, and 8.
