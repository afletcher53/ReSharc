This suggests the input grid is being expanded. Blocks in the input grid centered on cells with a value of 5 seem to be generating distinct patterns in the larger grid.\n\n2. **Centroid Expansion:** In each example, a cell with a value of 5 acts as a central point that maps out a specific pattern in the 6x6 output. For example, (1,1) in Eg. 1 input determines the pattern starting from the (1,1) cell location in the output. In Eg. 2, cells (0,0), (1,1), (2,2) map to blocks starting at (0,0), (2,2), (4,4) respectively in the output, which exhibit a pattern of alternating 1s and 2s.\n\n3. **Pattern Encoding:** Pattern typically follows a diagonal 'checkerboard' pattern starting with either '1' or '2', depending on the row and column positions.

In Example 2, entire \"8\" patches replace parts of the grid, notably placed on 2's when surrounding numbers are 1 within identified regions.\n4. A key observation is the presence of diagonal symmetry or specific patterns around the 8s, particularly influenced by diagonal crossings in the input grids.\n5. Apply the specific replacement logic to the test grid by identifying diagonal lines or sequences where such transformations from 1 to 8 occur, and adjust changes.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n [2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1],\n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1],\n [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 9942, "completion_tokens": 2350, "custom_id": "task_4ff4c9da_req_f967f048-4b98-409b-8f58-1cb61b1bae08", "batch_id": "batch_68252a3b69348190b4d42e7b90a8fa72"}

Notice that the 2s appear to propagate diagonally to the top-right when other numbers exist.  \n2. Origin of propagation: In each example, the transformation starts from a single 2 present at the bottom row of the input grid.\n3. Construct the diagonal pattern: The propagation forms a diagonal line moving from the position of the 2, wrapping around the numbers present in the grid to the top-right corner.     \n4. Apply this to new input: Start with the position of 2 in the test input grid and apply diagonal movement.\n5. Ensure patterns match: The movement should account for obstacles (marked by 1s) by being directed around them, overriding diagonally from their location to fill in the region where they interact.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 2910, "completion_tokens": 495, "custom_id": "task_69889d6e_req_92224e3f-1cb4-437f-a183-e92b8fc6e631", "batch_id": "batch_68252a3b69348190b4d42e7b90a8fa72"}

The pattern involves connecting areas of \"1\"s, \"3\"s, and other numbers with freshly added \"2\"s to create a coherent pattern visible across all examples.\n3. \"2\"s seem to extend into adjacent cells unless blocked by connectivity with consistent number (1 or 3), stopping spread.\n4. Our strategy is to mimic this fill pattern, ensuring every initial \"2\" area reaches its full cohesive size by spreading through adjacent empty cells.\n5. For the new input, I will identify every \"2\" and \"3\", then extend \"2\" into adjacent cells, obeying the connectivity rules observed.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 7575, "completion_tokens": 1307, "custom_id": "task_96a8c0cd_req_e402bd50-b002-4aa6-8f5b-e539c76404ed", "batch_id": "batch_68252a3b69348190b4d42e7b90a8fa72"}

The transformation is consistent: identify `2` position, create a vertical path towards the level of `1`, and move horizontally to align directly below it using `3`.\n5. Apply this transformation to the test input grid.\n</thinking>\n\nTo transform the test input grid:\n\n- Locate the position of `2` at `(13, 12)`.\n- Locate the position of `1` at `(1, 4)`.\n- Create a vertical line of `3`s from `(4, 12)` (aligned with row `1`) to `(12, 12)`.\n- Create a horizontal line of `3`s from `(4, 12)` to `(4, 4)` (aligned with column `4`).\n\n<answer>\n[\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 5970, "completion_tokens": 1039, "custom_id": "task_992798f6_req_34e09004-2478-44bd-abbc-55e0fc415e66", "batch_id": "batch_68252a3b69348190b4d42e7b90a8fa72"}
