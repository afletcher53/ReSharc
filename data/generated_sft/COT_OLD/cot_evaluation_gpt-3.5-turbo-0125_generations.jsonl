By observing the input-output pairs, it appears that the numbers in the output grid are determined based on the neighboring cells in the corresponding input grid.\n4. The pattern suggests that the number in a cell in the output grid is influenced by the values of the adjacent cells in the input grid.\n5. Applying this rule to the test input grid, we can determine the numbers for the output grid by considering the values of neighboring cells for each cell.\n\n<answer>:[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0", "prompt_tokens": 8638, "completion_tokens": 1024, "custom_id": "task_18419cfa_req_d8223c14-66e5-4b9c-9a6c-3d5f6be9d8b8", "batch_id": "batch_6825027d9ee88190a07e094c9a068b38"}

In each example, there seems to be a pattern where the number '1' is added to certain cells in the output grid.\n2. The '1' seems to be added to cells where there are specific arrangements of numbers around it, possibly indicating a certain context-based rule.\n3. By comparing the input and output grids, we can see that the '1' is added when there are '2's surrounding an empty cell in the input grid.\n4.

In the provided examples, the transformation rule seems to involve rearranging the elements in each row based on the position of a specific number in that row.\n2. The specific number in each row determines the position of the elements in that row. For example, in the first example, the number 2 determines the position of the number 5 in each row.\n3. By following this rule, we can rearrange the elements in the test input grid based on the position of number 1 in each row to get the final output grid.\n\nFinal Answer:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5", "prompt_tokens": 8632, "completion_tokens": 1024, "custom_id": "task_95a58926_req_1de813b2-a025-4e36-b5e2-6c68a367819c", "batch_id": "batch_6825027d9ee88190a07e094c9a068b38"}
