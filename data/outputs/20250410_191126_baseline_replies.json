    "00576224": "<thinking>\nTo solve the current task, I'll analyze the given examples and identify the pattern. Then, I'll apply this pattern to the test input to produce the correct test output grid.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The input grid has two rows, each containing two elements.\n   - The pattern seems to be a pattern where each element in one row is repeated twice.\n   - This suggests a repeating pattern in the second row.\n\n2. **Apply the Pattern to the Test Input:**\n   - The test input is a list of two lists.\n   - Each inner list contains two elements.\n   - To apply the pattern to the test input, we need to repeat the second element of each inner list twice.\n\n3. **Formulate the Output Grid:**\n   - The output grid should have the same number of rows as the test input.\n   - For each row in the test input, we need to repeat the second element twice.\n   - The resulting output grid will have the same structure as the test input, but with repeated elements.\n\n4. **Final Predicted Output Grid:**\n   - Based on the above reasoning, the final predicted output grid should be:\n     ```python\n     [[2, 2], [2, 2]]\n     ```\n\n### Final Answer\n\n<answer>\n[[2, 2], [2, 2]]\n</answer>"
