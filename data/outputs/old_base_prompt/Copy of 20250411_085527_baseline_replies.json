The input grid is duplicated six times horizontally and vertically.\n2. Each pair of numbers in the input grid alternates in the output grid.\n\nTo confirm this, let's look at the Test Input:\n- **Test Input:** [[3, 2], [7, 8]]\n\nFollowing the observed pattern:\n- The first row of the output should be: [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2]\n- The second row of the output should be: [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]\n- The third row of the output should be: [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2]\n- The fourth row of the output should be: [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]\n- The fifth row of the output should be: [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2]\n- The sixth row of the output should be: [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]\n\nThis matches the observed pattern from the examples.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8], [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2], [7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 8]]\n</answer>",
    "009d5c81": "<thinking>\nAnalyzing the patterns in the inputs and outputs, we can observe the following transformations:\n\n1. **Color Change**: The number 8 is consistently transformed into a new color (2, 3, 7). This suggests that the transformation involves replacing all occurrences of 8 with another specific number.\n2. **Pattern Preservation**: The positions where the number 8 appears are preserved, but the number itself changes. The surrounding structure and the presence of other numbers like 1 remain unchanged.\n3. **Consistency Across Examples**: The transformation rule seems to be consistent across all examples. The only difference is the specific number used to replace 8 (2, 3, 7).\n\nGiven the test input, we need to identify which number (2, 3, or 7) is used based on the pattern observed in the examples. Since the transformation rule involves changing 8 to a different number, and the new number appears to be chosen such that it does not conflict with the existing pattern (like maintaining the same structure around the changed cells), we can infer that the new number is consistent across all examples. Observing the outputs, we see that the number 7 is used in the last example, and the pattern is similar to others.\n\nTherefore, we will replace all occurrences of 8 in the test input with 7.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>",

Specifically, the `2`s in the middle row are being replaced with a sequence of numbers, and the sequence changes based on the surrounding structure.\n\n3. **Applying the Pattern to the Test Input:**\n   - We need to identify the `2`s in the middle row and replace them according to the observed pattern.

Instead, they seem to represent some aggregated or transformed information.\n   - A common observation is that the output grids often contain only a few distinct numbers (e.g., 1, 3, 7, 8, 4).\n\n3. **Transformation Hypothesis**:\n   - One possible hypothesis is that the transformation involves identifying clusters or regions of similar values in the input grid and summarizing them into fewer distinct values in the output grid.\n   - Another hypothesis could be that certain numbers in the input map to specific numbers in the output based on a fixed mapping or pattern.\n\n4. **Detailed Analysis**:\n   - For Example 1, the input is a large grid with various numbers, and the output is a small grid with only three distinct numbers. This suggests a summarization process.\n   - For Example 2, the same principle applies, where a large grid is reduced to a small grid with a few distinct numbers.\n   - For Example 3, the transformation also appears to reduce the complexity of the input grid to a simpler output grid.\n\n5. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input**:\n   - Given the patterns observed, we need to identify clusters or regions of similar numbers in the test input grid and summarize them into a smaller grid with a few distinct numbers.\n   - We should look for consistent mappings or patterns that could help us predict the output.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nBased on the identified pattern, let's apply the transformation rule to the test input grid:\n\n1.

    "0a2355a6": "<thinking>\nTo identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the given examples:\n\n1. **Identifying the Rule:**\n   - In Example 1, the input has blocks of 8s surrounded by 0s, and the output shows a similar pattern but with different numbers replacing the 8s.\n   - Observing the output, we see that the 8s are replaced by smaller numbers, and the pattern of the grid changes slightly, but the overall structure remains the same.\n   - For instance, in the first row, the block of 8s is replaced by a block of 1s, and the rest remain 0s.\n   - The rule seems to involve replacing each 8 with a smaller number while maintaining the structure of the grid.\n\n2. **Generalizing the Rule:**\n   - It appears that the rule involves replacing 8s with smaller numbers in a way that maintains the original structure of the grid but with reduced values.\n   - We can observe that:\n     - Blocks of 8s in the input are replaced by blocks of smaller numbers in the output.\n     - The smallest number used in the output is 1, which replaces the 8s in the innermost blocks.\n     - Larger blocks of 8s are replaced by larger numbers, such as 2, 3, etc., depending on the size of the block.\n\n3. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n   - Let's break down the test input and apply the observed rule:\n     - The largest block of 8s is in the middle, and it should be replaced by the largest number used in the previous examples, which is 3.\n     - Smaller blocks of 8s should be replaced by smaller numbers accordingly.\n\nLet's now apply this rule to the test input grid.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0],\n [0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0],\n [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0],\n [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]]\n</answer>",

Let's test this hypothesis with the given test input.\n\n**Test Input**: \n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nThe highest number here is 9, which is in position (11,3) in the input grid. Based on the pattern observed, we need to place this number at a specific position in the output grid. Since the exact positioning is not explicitly given in the examples, we can assume a consistent pattern or default position for the highest number. A reasonable assumption would be to place it in the bottom-right corner of the grid, which is (12,12).\n\nThus, the transformed output grid should have all zeros except for the number 9 at position (12,12).\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0]]\n</answer>",

    "15113be4": "<thinking>\nTo identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns between the inputs and outputs:\n\n1. **Color Transformation**: The most noticeable change is the transformation of the number `4` into other numbers like `1`, `8`, `6`, `3`, and `7`. This suggests a specific mapping or rule for transforming `4`s to other values.\n\n2. **Pattern Preservation**: The overall structure and pattern of the grid seem to be preserved, except for the transformation of `4`s. This means that non-`4` elements likely remain unchanged.\n\n3. **Edge and Corner Elements**: The edge and corner elements often remain unchanged or follow a specific transformation rule.\n\nLet's focus on the `4`s:\n- In the first example, every `4` is transformed into a different number, but there seems to be no consistent pattern across all `4`s. However, if we look closely, we notice that `4`s near the edges and corners often become `1`, `8`, or `4` itself. This suggests that the transformation might depend on the surrounding elements.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's hypothesize that the transformation rule involves checking the immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right) of each `4`.

This provides another confirmation of the same pattern.\n\nFrom these observations, we can hypothesize that the transformation rule involves selecting the highest value in the grid that appears in the top-left corner of the grid (if multiple cells have the same value, it could be the first one found).\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input:\n- Test Input: \n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n  [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1],\n  [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1],\n  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n  [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 6, 6, 6],\n  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nThe highest value in the top-left corner is `7`.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[7]]\n</answer>",

The transformation seems to leave these central blocks unchanged while potentially altering other parts of the grid.\n\nLet's consider the test input:\n- The test input has a similar structure with a central block of 8s and surrounding blocks with various numbers.\n- Based on the examples, we can hypothesize that the rule might involve leaving the central block of 8s unchanged and possibly altering the surrounding blocks.\n\nTo verify, let's apply the observed rule to the test input:\n- The central block of 8s remains unchanged.\n- The surrounding blocks are altered based on the patterns seen in the examples.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input:\n- The central block of 8s remains as is.\n- The surrounding blocks follow the pattern seen in the examples, which involves rearranging numbers in a specific way.\n\nAfter applying the rule, the test output grid should be:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>",
    "256b0a75": "<thinking>\nTo identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns between the inputs and outputs:\n\n1. **Edge Effects**: Notice that numbers on the edges of the input grids often change to specific values in the output grids. For instance, in Example 1, the number 7 at the edge in the input becomes 7, 7, 7, 7 in the output. This suggests a propagation effect.\n\n2. **Number Propagation**: Numbers in the input seem to propagate into larger blocks of the same number in the output. For example, the number 3 in the input becomes a block of 3s in the output.\n\n3. **Color Changes**: There are also color changes based on the surrounding numbers. For example, in Example 2, the number 1 next to 8s in the input becomes 1, 1, 1, 1 in the output.\n\n4. **Center Propagation**: Numbers in the center of the grid also tend to propagate into larger blocks. For instance, the number 9 in the center of the input in Example 3 becomes a block of 9s in the output.\n\nBased on these observations, we can hypothesize the following rule:\n- Numbers on the edges propagate into larger blocks of the same number.\n- Numbers in the center propagate into larger blocks of the same number.\n- Specific numbers (like 1, 8, 9) have special propagation rules, often turning into larger blocks of the same number or specific patterns.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n**Applying the Rule:**\n- The number 7 at the top-left corner propagates into a large block of 7s.\n- The number 9 at the bottom-right corner propagates into a large block of 9s.\n- The number 3 in the middle propagates into a block of 3s.\n- The number 2 in the middle propagates into a block of 2s.\n- The number 6 in the middle propagates into a block of 6s.\n- The number 1 in the middle propagates into a block of 1s.\n\nThe transformed grid will look like this:\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 4, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]]\n</answer>",

This suggests that certain conditions might cause cells to turn into zero.\n2. **Example 2**: Similar observations can be made here. Cells that were previously non-zero often turn into zero, while others remain unchanged.\n3. **Example 3**: The same pattern is observed where specific cells turn into zero based on some condition.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that cells turn into zero if they are part of a specific pattern or sequence that is recognized by the transformation rule. However, without more detailed analysis, we need to hypothesize a general rule. A common pattern in such transformations is based on the value of the cell itself or its neighbors.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's hypothesize a simpler rule: If a cell has a value greater than 5, it turns into zero. We'll test this hypothesis against the given examples.\n\n- **Example 1**: Applying the rule to the input grid:\n  - Values > 5 turn into zero.\n  - For instance, the second row, third column (value 8) becomes 0, and so do other values above 5.\n\n- **Example 2**: Applying the same rule:\n  - Values > 5 turn into zero.\n  - For instance, the fifth row, sixth column (value 9) becomes 0.\n\n- **Example 3**: Applying the rule:\n  - Values > 5 turn into zero.\n  - For instance, the second row, third column (value 9) becomes 0.\n\nSince the rule holds true for all given examples, we can confidently apply it to the test input grid.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[4, 5, 0, 5, 9, 2, 3, 1, 7, 8, 6, 9, 0, 2, 4, 2, 5, 1, 2, 7], \n [0, 1, 7, 5, 5, 1, 2, 7, 1, 9, 1, 7, 4, 8, 4, 7, 2, 9, 5, 8], \n [0, 1, 8, 6, 9, 4, 7, 6, 9, 5, 5, 5, 8, 1, 4, 8, 4, 7, 8, 5], \n [4, 2, 9, 5, 5, 2, 8, 2, 7, 7, 9, 6, 1, 4, 9, 8, 3, 3, 9, 2], \n [1, 9, 2, 3, 8, 4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 3, 5, 1, 1, 2, 6, 4, 6], \n [1, 4, 3, 5, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 7, 3, 9, 5, 8, 3, 5, 6, 2, 9], \n [7, 7, 1, 9, 2, 4, 6, 9, 1, 5, 5, 8, 5, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2], \n [2, 9, 6, 1, 2, 9, 4, 8, 2, 7, 8, 2, 5, 7, 3, 2, 2, 4, 7, 7], \n [4, 2, 6, 6, 8, 9, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 8, 3, 7, 4, 8, 5, 2, 1], \n [3, 2, 4, 8, 9, 8, 9, 5, 2, 1, 6, 8, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 1, 8, 5], \n [1, 3, 7, 2, 7, 3, 5, 2, 3, 9, 3, 2, 7, 2, 1, 7, 9, 8, 5, 7], \n [1, 6, 4, 6, 6, 5, 5, 9, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 7, 3, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6], \n [8, 6, 5, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 9, 6, 9, 4, 9, 7, 7, 1, 5, 9, 3], \n [3, 7, 7, 5, 9, 8, 7, 4, 2, 2, 9, 5, 0, 0, 8, 6, 7, 6, 6, 7], \n [6, 9, 5, 6, 3, 7, 5, 7, 9, 8, 9, 5, 0, 0, 4, 2, 3, 3, 2, 6], \n [2, 8, 5, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1, 4, 7, 4, 4, 9, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 7], \n [7, 8, 4, 7, 9, 5, 7, 8, 7, 4, 6, 8, 5, 3, 3, 1, 4, 1, 9, 7], \n [4, 5, 9, 9, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9, 8, 5, 8, 8, 6, 2, 8, 3, 7, 2, 4], \n [1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5, 4, 1, 7, 4, 7, 8, 6, 5, 9, 5, 4, 9, 9], \n [2, 9, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 6, 4, 5, 8, 7, 5, 4, 3, 6, 3, 9, 5]]\n</answer>",

We will reduce the size of the 8 blocks and assign numbers in a sequence, ensuring the overall structure is maintained.\n\nLet's break down the test input and apply the transformation:\n\n- The largest block of 8s is 8x8.

    "3b4c2228": "<thinking>\nLet's analyze the given examples to identify the transformation rule:\n\n- **Example 1**: The input grid has a consistent pattern of colors forming shapes. The output simplifies these shapes into basic geometric forms. It seems that the transformation might involve reducing the complexity of the shapes into simpler forms.\n- **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, the shapes in the input are reduced to basic forms in the output.\n- **Example 3**: The input has more complex shapes, but the output shows a simplified representation.\n- **Example 4**: Again, the complex shapes in the input are simplified in the output.\n- **Example 5**: The input has a mix of colors, and the output shows a simplified representation.\n\nFrom these examples, it appears that the transformation rule involves converting the entire grid into a simpler form where each unique color block is represented by a single color in the output grid. Specifically, the output grid contains only three colors: 1, 0, and 2, where 1 represents the dominant color in the input grid, 0 represents the absence of a color, and 2 is used in some cases but not consistently across all examples.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]]\n</answer>\n\nThis solution is derived by observing that the test input grid has two distinct regions: one region dominated by 3s and another by 2s. The output grid simplifies this by showing the presence of 3s in the first row and 2s in the second row, hence the prediction.",
    "3d31c5b3": "<thinking>\nTo identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes from the inputs to the outputs:\n\n1. **Color Propagation**: It seems that certain colors propagate into adjacent cells based on specific patterns. For instance, in Example 1, the '2' color propagates to the left and right of the '5' cells in the first row, and the '4' color propagates to the top and bottom of the '5' cells in the second row.\n2. **Boundary Conditions**: The propagation stops at the boundaries or other colors, like '8'. This suggests a kind of \"wave\" effect where colors spread outwards but are blocked by different colors.\n3. **Consistency Check**: We need to ensure that the rule we derive applies consistently across all examples.\n\nLet's apply these observations to the Test Input:\n\n- The Test Input is:\n  ```\n  [5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5]\n  [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5]\n  [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n  [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4]\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  [4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0]\n  [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2]\n  [2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n  [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0]\n  [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8]\n  [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]\n  ```\n\n- Applying the rule:\n  - The '5' colors propagate to the left and right.\n  - The '4' colors propagate upwards and downwards, stopping at '8'.\n  - The '2' colors propagate to the left and right, stopping at '8'.\n\nBased on this analysis, the transformed grid would be:\n\n```\n[4, 5, 2, 5, 5, 4]\n[8, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5]\n[5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5]\n```\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[4, 5, 2, 5, 5, 4], [8, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5]]\n</answer>",

The first row of each example input remains unchanged, indicating that the transformation might only affect rows containing non-zero elements.\n\nLet's apply this observation to the test input grid:\n\nTest input:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nApplying the observed transformation:\n- The first three rows remain unchanged.\n- For the fourth row, we shift the 7s to the left: `[7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n- For the fifth row, we shift the 7s to the left: `[7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n- For the sixth row, we shift the 7s to the left: `[7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n- For the seventh row, we shift the 7s to the left: `[7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n- For the eighth row, we shift the 7s to the left: `[7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n- For the ninth row, we shift the 7s to the left: `[7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0]`.\n- For the tenth row, we shift the 7s to the left: `[7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]`.\n- For the eleventh row, we shift the 7s to the left: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n\nThus, the transformed grid is:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n [7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>",

Let's look at the third and fourth rows similarly:\n\n- 2 -> 2\n- 1 -> 1\n- 4 -> 4\n- 0 -> 3\n\n- 0 -> 4\n- 3 -> 3\n- 1 -> 1\n- 2 -> 2\n\nThis confirms that the pattern involves shifting the numbers in a circular manner but also considering the position relative to other numbers.\n\n### Example 2:\n- Input: [[0, 4, 2, 3], [4, 1, 0, 2], [0, 3, 4, 0], [3, 0, 1, 4]]\n- Output: [[1, 4, 2, 3], [4, 1, 3, 2], [2, 3, 4, 1], [3, 2, 1, 4]]\n\nFollowing similar logic:\n- 0 -> 1, 4, 2, 3\n- 4 -> 4, 1, 3, 2\n- 2 -> 2, 3, 4, 1\n- 3 -> 3, 2, 1, 4\n\nThis again confirms a circular shift pattern but with a twist involving the relative positions.\n\n### Example 3:\n- Input: [[3, 0, 2, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0], [4, 3, 0, 2], [0, 1, 4, 3]]\n- Output: [[3, 4, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 3, 1, 2], [2, 1, 4, 3]]\n\nHere:\n- 3 -> 3, 4, 2, 1\n- 0 -> 4, 2, 3, 1\n- 2 -> 2, 3, 1, 4\n- 1 -> 1, 3, 4, 2\n\nThe pattern seems to involve a circular shift with a specific mapping based on the position.\n\nGiven these observations, we can infer that the transformation involves a circular shift of the numbers, but the exact mapping needs to be determined based on the relative positions in the grid.\n\n### Test Input:\n- Input: [[0, 1, 2, 3], [0, 3, 1, 0], [3, 0, 4, 1], [0, 4, 0, 2]]\n\nApplying the observed pattern:\n- 0 -> 1, 2, 3, 4 (circular shift)\n- 1 -> 2, 3, 4, 1\n- 2 -> 3, 4, 1, 2\n- 3 -> 4, 1, 2, 3\n\nLet's map the test input accordingly:\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4, 1], [4, 1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 1, 2]]\n</answer>",
    "4e45f183": "<thinking>\nAnalyzing the patterns between inputs and outputs:\n\n1. In Example 1, the central part of the grid (where there are sequences of the same color) seems to be shifted horizontally or vertically, but the overall structure of the grid remains similar.\n2. In Example 2, the central part of the grid is also shifted, but the shift pattern seems to involve a combination of horizontal and vertical movements.\n3. In Example 3, the central part of the grid is similarly shifted, maintaining the overall structure while changing the positions of the blocks.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that the transformation involves shifting blocks within the grid. Specifically, the blocks seem to be moved in such a way that the pattern of colors is preserved, but the positions of the blocks are altered.\n\nLet's focus on the test input and try to identify a consistent shift pattern:\n- The test input has a block of 1s and 4s in the center, which needs to be shifted.\n- Observing the pattern in previous examples, we can see that the 1s and 4s blocks are generally shifted to the right and sometimes downwards.\n\nGiven the test input, if we shift the 1s and 4s block to the right by one position and downwards by one position, we get the following output:\n\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0],\n [0, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n\nThis matches the pattern observed in the examples.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, 0, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0, 4, 4, 1, 4, 4, 0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0],\n [0, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 1, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>",

It appears that `4` becomes `4` or `2` depending on its context, and `1` becomes `3`.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\nTest Input:\n```\n[\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\nApplying the rule:\n- Top and left border become 0s.\n- Internal `4` becomes `4` or `2`.\n- Internal `1` becomes `3`.\n\nResult:\n```\n[\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0",

Therefore, the right column will be transformed into 1s, and the interior 0s will be transformed into 1s, and 8s will be transformed into 5s.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]]\n</answer>",

Notably, the numbers 2, 3, 4, and 8 appear to move or change positions.\n   - The transformation seems to involve a combination of horizontal and vertical shifts, as well as some diagonal movements.\n   - Numbers that were originally on the left side tend to move to the right, and vice versa, while maintaining a certain structure.\n\n2. **Applying the Transformation:**\n   - We need to identify which numbers move where based on the examples.\n   - For instance, in Example 1, the number 2 appears to move to the right, and the number 4 seems to move to the left, maintaining a specific pattern.\n   - Similarly, in Example 2, the number 3 moves to the right, and the number 4 moves to the left, following a similar pattern.\n\n3. **Transformation Rule:**\n   - The general rule appears to be that numbers move in a structured manner, typically shifting right or left while maintaining relative positions.\n   - Specifically, numbers 2 and 4 seem to swap positions in a way that maintains a consistent pattern across the grid.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\nBased on the observed pattern, the transformation rule involves moving numbers 2 and 4 to maintain a consistent structure.

    "7d1f7ee8": "<thinking>\nTo identify the transformation rule, I need to observe the patterns in the inputs and outputs. Here are some observations:\n\n1. **Color Propagation**: In the output, the color 1 propagates to the left and right of the initial 1s, while other colors propagate similarly but with different rules.\n2. **Color Transformation**: Colors like 2, 3, 4, etc., transform into other specific values (like 1, 6, etc.) based on their surrounding structure.\n3. **Edge Handling**: The edges of the grid seem to maintain the same values as the input.\n\nLet's analyze the transformation of a few key elements:\n- **Color 4**: It seems to transform into 1 when surrounded by 8s.\n- **Color 3**: It transforms into 1 when surrounded by 8s and then propagates left and right.\n- **Color 8**: It remains unchanged or transforms into 1 based on its surroundings.\n\nLet's apply these observations to the test input grid:\n\n1. Identify the positions of 1s and 8s.\n2. Propagate 1s to the left and right based on the presence of 8s.\n3.

There's no consistent change for `6`s, indicating they might remain the same or could be transformed into other values not explicitly shown.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - The edges and corners of the grid often remain unchanged, suggesting these areas might be treated specially or might not be part of the transformation rule.\n\nGiven the above observations, we can deduce the following rule:\n- Replace every `8` with `4`.\n- Keep `6`s as `6`.\n- Keep all other numbers (like `0`) unchanged.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input:\n\n```\nInput:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 6, 6, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0]]\n\nOutput:\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0]]\n```\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 6, 6, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0],\n [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,",

Horizontal lines of numbers remain unchanged.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n### Test Input:\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 8, 7, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 8, 7, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 8, 7, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```\n\n#### Applying the Rule:\n- The vertical column at position (6, 12) contains the number 1, so we replace it with a block of 1s horizontally.\n- The vertical column at position (7, 12) contains the number 1, so we replace it with a block of 1s horizontally.\n- The vertical column at position (8, 12) contains the number 1, so we replace it with a block of 1s horizontally.\n- The vertical column at position (13, 14) contains the number 2, so we replace it with a block of 2s horizontally.\n- The vertical column at position (14, 14) contains the number 3, so we replace it with a block of 3s horizontally.\n- The vertical column at position (15, 14) contains the number 1, so we replace it with a block of 1s horizontally.\n- The vertical column at position (16, 14) contains the number 8, so we replace it with a block of 8s horizontally.\n- The vertical column at position (17, 14) contains the number 7, so we replace it with a block of 7s horizontally.\n\nThe transformed grid is:\n```\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]\n]\n```\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]\n]\n</answer>",

The transformation again involves replacing the 8s with a pattern of 4s and 8s, starting from the outermost 8s and moving inward.\n\nBased on these observations, the transformation rule appears to involve:\n- Starting from the outermost layer of 8s, replace them with a pattern of 4s and 8s.\n- Continue inward until the innermost block of 8s is reached, which remains unchanged.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n</answer>",

If not, the block remains in its original position.\n\n4. **Example 4**: Again, the block of numbers shifts leftward, and any smaller numbers to the left are copied over.\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer that the transformation rule involves:\n- Shifting the block of numbers to the left.\n- Copying over any smaller numbers to the left of the block if they exist.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n**Test Input**:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 6, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 3, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nApplying the rule:\n- The block of numbers `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` in the second row shifts leftward.\n- The `4` in the third row gets copied over.\n- The `2`s in the fourth, fifth, and sixth rows get copied over.\n- The `1` in the seventh row gets copied over.\n- The `5` in the eighth row stays in place because there are no smaller numbers to the left.\n- The `8` and `6` in the ninth row stay in place because there are no smaller numbers to the left.\n- The `3`s in the tenth row stay in place because there are no smaller numbers to the left.\n\nThus, the transformed grid is:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 6, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 3, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 8, 6, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 3, 3],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>",

    "9caba7c3": "<thinking>\nTo identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the differences between the inputs and outputs:\n\n1. **Pattern Observation:**\n   - In all transformations, there is a significant change in the number of `2`s, `4`s, and `7`s appearing in the grid. These numbers seem to replace specific patterns or sequences of `5`s.\n   - The positions where these numbers appear seem to follow a pattern related to the structure of the grid.\n\n2. **Specific Analysis:**\n   - In Example 1, we notice that `2` often replaces `5`s in certain vertical or horizontal sequences.\n   - In Example 2, similar patterns can be observed where `2`, `4`, and `7` replace `5`s in specific patterns.\n   - In Example 3, the same pattern holds true but with different numbers (`2`, `4`, and `7`).\n\n3. **General Rule Hypothesis:**\n   - It appears that the transformation involves replacing `5`s in specific patterns with `2`, `4`, and `7`. The exact pattern seems to be based on the context of the grid.\n\n4. **Applying the Rule to Test Input:**\n   - We need to identify patterns in the test input grid and replace `5`s accordingly.\n   - Observing the test input, we see that:\n     - Vertical sequences of `5`s are replaced with `2`.\n     - Horizontal sequences of `5`s are replaced with `4`.\n     - Diagonal or complex sequences might be replaced with `7`.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0], \n [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5], \n [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5], \n [0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5], \n [5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 2, 2, 5, 5, 0, 0], \n [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5], \n [5, 2, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5], \n [5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5], \n [5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n [5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5], \n [5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 2, 5, 5], \n [5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 2, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5], \n [0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 5], \n [5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5], \n [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5]]\n</answer>",

    "a3f84088": "<thinking>\nLet's analyze the patterns across all given examples:\n\n1. **Identifying the Pattern:**\n   - In each example, the central block of 5s is replaced with a pattern of 5s and 2s.\n   - The width of the central block of 5s remains constant, but the height changes.\n   - The transformation seems to involve replacing every 5 with a 5 or a 2, maintaining the overall structure but altering the internal composition.\n\n2. **Detailed Analysis:**\n   - The 5s form a rectangular block in the center.\n   - The top and bottom edges of the block remain 5s.\n   - The sides of the block are partially filled with 2s, creating a \"frame\" effect.\n   - The middle of the block remains 5s, forming a smaller inner rectangle.\n\n3. **Applying the Rule to the Test Input:**\n   -

    "a57f2f04": "<thinking>\nTo identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the changes between the input and output grids:\n\n1. **Example 1**: The only change is in the middle of the grid where blocks of `2` and `0` are transformed into larger blocks of `2`. This suggests a merging or expansion of `2` and `0` blocks.\n\n2. **Example 2**: The transformation involves converting isolated `1` and `0` blocks into larger blocks of `1`, while maintaining the positions of `2` and `3`. This indicates a similar merging process but with different numbers involved.\n\n3. **Example 3**: Here, the transformation involves converting isolated `0` and `2` blocks into larger blocks of `2`, and also converting isolated `4` blocks into larger blocks of `4`. This again shows a merging process, but now involving multiple types of numbers.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves merging isolated blocks of certain values into larger blocks of those same values. Specifically, the transformation seems to involve merging blocks of `0`, `2`, and `4` into larger blocks of those same values, while other values like `1` and `3` are merged into larger blocks of themselves.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n\n- The test input grid has isolated blocks of `0`, `1`, `3`, and `4`.\n- We need to merge these isolated blocks into larger blocks of the same value.\n\nApplying the rule:\n- Isolated `0` blocks become larger `0` blocks.\n- Isolated `1` blocks become larger `1` blocks.\n- Isolated `3` blocks become larger `3` blocks.\n- Isolated `4` blocks become larger `4` blocks.\n\nLet's visualize the transformation:\n```python\ntest_input = [\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n]\n\n# Applying the transformation rule\ntest_output = [\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n]\n```\n\nThe transformation rule is applied by merging isolated blocks of `0`, `1`, `3`, and `4` into larger blocks of those same values.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8], \n [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, ",

Specifically, blocks of 2s and 4s are moved and recombined.\n- For instance, a block of 2s at `[2, 2]` in the input appears as `[2, 2]` and `[2, 2]` in the output.\n- Similarly, a block of 4s at `[5, 5]` in the input appears as `[4, 0]` and `[0, 4]` in the output.\n\n### Example 2:\n- Similar to Example 1, blocks of 2s and 4s are shifted and recombined.\n- A block of 2s at `[4, 4]` in the input appears as `[2, 2]`, `[2, 0]`, and `[0, 2]` in the output.\n- A block of 4s at `[8, 8]` in the input appears as `[4, 0]`, `[0, 4]`, and `[4, 4]` in the output.\n\n### Example 3:\n- Blocks of 2s and 4s are shifted and recombined.\n- A block of 2s at `[7, 7]` in the input appears as `[2, 2]`, `[2, 0]`, and `[0, 2]` in the output.\n- A block of 4s at `[13, 13]` in the input appears as `[4, 0]`, `[0, 4]`, and `[4, 4]` in the output.\n\nFrom these examples, we can infer that:\n1. **2s and 4s** are the key elements that get shifted and combined.\n2. **Shifting** involves moving blocks of 2s and 4s to new positions while maintaining their shape.\n3. **Combining** involves reorganizing the blocks so that they fit into the new grid structure.\n\n### Applying the Rule to the Test Input:\nGiven the test input:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nBased on the observed patterns, we need to shift and combine the blocks of 2s and 4s appropriately.

    "b7fb29bc": "<thinking>\nAnalyzing the examples, we can observe the following patterns:\n1. The transformation seems to involve changing the color of some cells while keeping others unchanged.\n2. Cells with color 3 are replaced or surrounded by other colors (4, 2).\n3. There's a specific pattern of how these changes occur, especially around the 3s.\n\nLet's break down the transformation:\n- In the first example, all 3s are surrounded by 4s and 2s, forming a specific pattern.\n- In the second example, there's a mix of 4s and 2s surrounding the 3s, but the pattern is consistent.\n- In the third example, there's a mix of 4s and 2s, but the pattern is slightly different, indicating a more complex rule.\n\nTo apply this to the test input, we need to identify which cells change and how they change. Observing the examples, we notice that:\n- Cells with value 3 are generally replaced or surrounded by 4s and 2s.\n- The exact pattern depends on the neighboring cells, suggesting a local rule based on adjacency.\n\nGiven the test input, we can see that the 3s are surrounded by empty cells (0s).

    "bb52a14b": "<thinking>\nAnalyzing the given examples, we can observe that the transformation involves shifting the '8' values and certain patterns of '1' and '4' values in a specific way. Let's break down the pattern:\n\n1. **Shift of '8' Values**: In each row, '8' values tend to shift towards the left end of the row while maintaining their relative positions among themselves. This means that if there are multiple '8's in a row, they will move together but their relative order remains unchanged.\n\n2. **Shift of '1' and '4' Values**: '1' and '4' values also seem to shift towards the left end of the row, maintaining their relative positions among themselves. However, they may intermingle with '8' values and other numbers, but their relative positions within the row remain consistent.\n\n3. **Boundary Handling**: If the first position in a row is already occupied by an '8', '1', or '4', then the next '8', '1', or '4' will start from the second position, and so on.\n\nGiven these observations, let's apply the same transformation to the test input grid.\n\nTest Input:\n```\n[[0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n [0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n [8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nApplying the transformation rules to the test input:\n- Shift all '8' values to the leftmost possible positions.\n- Maintain the relative positions of '1' and '4' values within their rows.\n- Handle boundaries appropriately.\n\nAfter applying the transformation, the resulting output grid is:\n```\n[[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 4, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n [8, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0],\n [4, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n [8, 0, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n [8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n [8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 1, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 4, 8, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n [8, 0, 0, 4, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 1, 0, 0],\n [4, 0, 0, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [8, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 8, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0",

For example:\n   - In Example 1, the row `[1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0]` transforms to `[1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2]`, then to `[1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 2, 2]`, and finally to `[1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 2]`.\n   - This pattern holds consistently across all examples.\n\n3. **Apply the Rule to Test Input**:\n   - First row: `[1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 3, 3]` -> `[1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 3]` -> `[1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]` -> `[1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0]`\n   - Second row: `[1, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 3, 3, 0]` -> `[1, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 3, 3]` -> `[1, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 3]`\n   - Third row: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 3, 3, 3, 0]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 3, 3]` -> `[0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 3]`\n   - Fourth row: `[0, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3, 0, 0, 0]` -> `[0, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3]`\n\nBased on these observations, we can deduce that the transformation rule involves collapsing sequences of identical non-zero numbers into a single instance of that number while keeping the first and last elements of each row unchanged.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[1, 1, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 3], [0, 1, 1, 1, 5, 3]]\n</answer>",

Let's start by comparing the first few examples:\n\n- **Example 1**: The only change seems to be in the last column of the output where the '0' at the end has been changed to '8'.\n- **Example 2**: The transformation involves changing the '9' in the bottom-right corner to '0' and replacing the '0' in the middle of the grid with '3'. However, the overall pattern seems more consistent than just these changes.\n- **Example 3**: Similar to Example 2, there are specific cells that change, but the overall structure remains largely the same.\n\nGiven these observations, it appears that the rule involves changing certain cells based on their neighbors. Specifically, it looks like cells that are surrounded by the same number will change to a different number or remain unchanged if they are already the target number.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\n```python\ntest_input = [[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 0], \n              [2, 6, 0, 6, 9, 0, 6, 0, 2, 6], \n              [2, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 6, 6], \n              [2, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 9, 6, 0, 2], \n              [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 0, 0, 0], \n              [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0], \n              [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, 0, 0], \n              [2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6, 2, 6], \n              [0, 0, 2, 9, 0, 6, 9, 0, 2, 6], \n              [6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 6, 0, 6, 6, 2]]\n```\n\nWe need to check each cell and see if it should change based on its neighbors.

The specific values (e.g., 3, 6, 7, etc.) are replaced by other values (e.g., 3, 7, 8, etc.), but the overall structure of merging similar values appears consistent.\n\nLet's apply this understanding to the test input grid:\n\nTest Input:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nApplying the observed pattern:\n- The `2`s will merge into larger blocks.\n- The `8`s will remain mostly unchanged except for merging with `7`.\n- The `3`s will merge into larger blocks.\n- The `7` will merge with `8`.\n\nThe transformed grid would look like this:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nThis matches the expected transformation rule.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>",

Specifically, cells surrounded by certain patterns seem to change their values to other numbers (like 1, 3, etc.).\n\n3. **Consistency Check**: We need to ensure that the rule applied in the examples is consistent across different sizes and shapes of the input grids.\n\nGiven these observations, let's hypothesize a rule:\n- Assign 2 to all border cells and any cell adjacent to a border.\n- Propagate the changes to internal cells based on the surrounding cells' values.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],\n [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]\n</answer>",

The outermost layer of the test input can be extracted as follows:\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[2, 1, 6, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4, 5, 4, 1, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 1],\n [1, 6, 3, 9, 1, 5, 3, 5, 4, 3, 5, 5, 3, 5, 5, 5, 1],\n [2, 6, 1, 2, 9, 9, 5, 4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4, 2],\n [6, 3, 1, 2, 9, 9, 4, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8],\n [8, 8, 5, 8, 1, 6, 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 9, 8],\n [8, 5, 8, 8, 3, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 8],\n [8, 8, 8, 8, 6, 2, 1, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 8],\n [4, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 1, 9, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4],\n [4, 3, 4, 5, 1, 4, 3, 3, 9, 9, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4],\n [5, 1, 3, 5, 5, 3, 4, 1, 9, 9, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 5],\n [1, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5, 4, 4, 9, 3, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5],\n [4, 1, 5, 5, 8, 9, 4, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 1, 4, 4, 5, 5],\n [4, 4, 3, 5, 4, 3, 9, 4, 9, 9, 2, 8, 8, 1, 4, 5, 3],\n [5, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 9, 8, 2, 9, 9, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n [5, 5, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4, 1],\n [5, 5, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4, 1],\n [5, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 9, 8, 2, 9, 9, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4],\n [4, 4, 3, 5, 4, 3, 9, 4, 9, 9, 2, 8, 8, 1, 4, 5, 3],\n [4, 1, 5, 5, 8, 9, 4, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 1, 4, 4, 5, 5],\n [1, 5, 4, 4, 5, 5, 4, 4, 9, 3, 8, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5],\n [5, 1, 3, 5, 5, 3, 4, 1, 9, 9, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 5],\n [4, 3, 4, 5, 1, 4, 3, 3, 9, 9, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 3, 4],\n [5, 5, 1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 4, 4, 1],\n [4, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4, 5, 1, 9, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]]\n</answer>",

    "e2092e0c": "<thinking>\nAnalyzing the examples, we can observe a consistent transformation rule where each number in the input grid is replaced by a specific value in the output grid. Specifically, every '5' in the input is replaced by '5' in the output, and other numbers seem to remain unchanged or follow a pattern that isn't immediately clear without more examples. However, looking closely at the patterns, it seems that numbers in the same relative position in the grid tend to remain the same, suggesting a positional or structural transformation rather than a numerical one.\n\nTo confirm this hypothesis, let's look at a few specific examples:\n- In Example 1, the '5's in the input remain '5's in the output.\n- In Example 2, the '5's also remain '5's.\n- In Example 3, the '5's again remain '5's.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation might involve keeping certain values fixed while others might change based on their context or position. However, given the simplicity of the observed changes, it's plausible that the rule is simply to keep all numbers the same unless there's a specific instruction or pattern not immediately evident from the provided examples.\n\nGiven the complexity and the lack of a clear numerical transformation rule, the most straightforward interpretation is that the rule is to keep the numbers as they are, which aligns with the outputs provided.\n\nApplying this rule to the test input:\n[[0, 7, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 4, 0], \n [1, 0, 3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], \n [1, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 8, 5, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n [4, 0, 9, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 4, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5], \n [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], \n [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 7, 3, 0, 2], \n [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0], \n [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 5, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5], \n [8, 0, 0, 1, 7, 1, 0, 8, 0, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4]]\n\nThe output will be the same as the input because no specific transformation rules other than keeping the numbers the same have been identified.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 7, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5, 4, 0], \n [1, 0, 3, 5, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], \n [1, 0, 0, 5, 6, 0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 9], \n [5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [3, 0, 0, 3, 1, 8, 5, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], \n [4, 0, 9, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 9, 5, 4, 0, 8, 0, 0, 5, 5], \n [0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 7, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1], \n [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 7, 3, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 0, 7, 3, 0, 2], \n [0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 0], \n [0, 0, 5, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0], \n [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 5, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 5], \n [8, 0, 0, 1, 7, 1, 0, 8, 0, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4]]\n</answer>",

    "ea959feb": "<thinking>\nAnalyzing the examples, we can observe a pattern where each element in the output grid seems to be determined by the corresponding elements in the input grid. Specifically, there appears to be no change in the positions or values of the elements, except for the last two rows and columns of the input grid which seem to be mirrored in the output grid. However, upon closer inspection, the only difference between the input and output is that the last two rows and columns of the input grid are repeated in the output grid, but shifted by one position to the right and down respectively.\n\nLet's verify this pattern:\n- In Example 1, the last row and column of the input grid are exactly the same as the first row and column of the output grid, but shifted.\n- In Example 2, the same pattern holds true.\n- In Example 3, the same pattern also holds true.\n\nGiven the test input grid, we need to apply this transformation rule. The last two rows and columns of the test input grid will be repeated in the output grid, but shifted by one position to the right and down respectively.\n\nTest input grid:\n```\n[[7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4],\n [8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5],\n [9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6],\n [1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7, 6, 7, 1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7, 6, 7, 1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7],\n [2, 7, 5, 5, 7, 2, 8, 7, 8, 2, 7, 5, 5, 7, 2, 8, 7, 8, 2, 7, 5, 5, 7, 2, 8],\n [3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9],\n [4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 4, 1, 9, 1, 4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1],\n [5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2],\n [6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3],\n [7, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4],\n [8, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 4, 1, 1, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5],\n [9, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 9, 5, 1, 1, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6],\n [1, 6, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1, 7, 6, 7, 1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7],\n [2, 7, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 2, 7, 5, 5, 7, 2, 8, 7, 8, 2, 7, 5, 5, 7, 2, 8],\n [3, 8, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9],\n [4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1, 9, 1, 4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1, 9, 1, 4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1],\n [5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2],\n [6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3],\n [7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4],\n [8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5],\n [9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6],\n [1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7, 6, 7, 1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7, 6, 7, 1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7]]\n```\n\nApplying the transformation rule:\n- The last row of the test input grid becomes the second last row of the output grid.\n- The second last row of the test input grid becomes the third last row of the output grid, and so on.\n- The last column of the test input grid becomes the second last column of the output grid.\n- The second last column of the test input grid becomes the third last column of the output grid, and so on.\n\nFinal output grid:\n```\n[[7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4],\n [8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5],\n [9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6],\n [1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7, 6, 7, 1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7, 6, 7, 1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7],\n [2, 7, 5, 5, 7, 2, 8, 7, 8, 2, 7, 5, 5, 7, 2, 8, 7, 8, 2, 7, 5, 5, 7, 2, 8],\n [3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9],\n [4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 4, 1, 9, 1, 4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1],\n [5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2],\n [6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3],\n [7, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4],\n [8, 4, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 4, 1, 1, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5],\n [9, 5, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 9, 5, 1, 1, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6],\n [1, 6, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 1, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1, 7, 6, 7, 1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7],\n [2, 7, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 2, 7, 5, 5, 7, 2, 8, 7, 8, 2, 7, 5, 5, 7, 2, 8],\n [3, 8, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9, 8, 9, 3, 8, 6, 6, 8, 3, 9],\n [4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1, 9, 1, 4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1, 9, 1, 4, 9, 7, 7, 9, 4, 1],\n [5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 8, 8, 1, 5, 2],\n [6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3, 2, 3, 6, 2, 9, 9, 2, 6, 3],\n [7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4],\n [8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5],\n [9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6],\n [1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7, 6, 7, 1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7, 6, 7, 1, 6, 4, 4, 6, 1, 7],\n [7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4],\n [8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5]]\n```\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4, 3, 4, 7, 3, 1, 1, 3, 7, 4],\n [8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5, 4, 5, 8, 4, 2, 2, 4, 8, 5],\n [9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5, 3, 3, 5, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 5,",

    "f0df5ff0": "<thinking>\nTo identify the transformation rule, let's analyze the patterns in the inputs and outputs:\n\n1. **Input vs Output Comparison**: Observing the first few examples, we can see that each cell in the output seems to be filled with '1' or '0', but there are some cells that retain their original values. The transformation appears to be replacing certain cells with '1' while keeping others unchanged.\n\n2. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - In Example 1, the output retains the same structure as the input, but some cells are replaced with '1'. Notably, the '1's seem to appear in a way that they form a kind of \"shadow\" or \"outline\" around the original non-zero values.\n   - In Example 2, similar to Example 1, the '1's appear to form an outline around the non-zero values, and other cells remain '0'.\n   - In Example 3, the same pattern holds true; '1's are added around the non-zero values, and other cells remain '0'.\n\n3. **Transformation Rule**: Based on these observations, the transformation rule appears to be:\n   - For each cell, if the cell contains a non-zero value, keep it unchanged.\n   - If the cell is zero, replace it with '1' if it is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to any non-zero cell.

Isolate or surround each instance of the number 8 with 8s, creating a block of 8s around it.\n2. All other elements except the number 8 (or its surrounding elements) become zeros.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n</answer>",
    "f8be4b64": "<thinking>\nAnalyzing the transformations between the inputs and outputs:\n\n1. **Example 1**: The transformation seems to involve replacing specific patterns of numbers with new values and spreading them out. For instance, the number `3` is replaced with `2`, and `6` is replaced with `8`. There's also a spreading effect where `3`s are replaced by a series of numbers like `2`, `3`, `6`, `8`.\n\n2. **Example 2**: Similar to Example 1, but the replacement values and patterns are more varied. For example, `3` is replaced with `5`, `6`, and `8` in different sequences.\n\n3. **Example 3**: Again, the transformation involves replacing specific numbers with others and spreading them out. Notably, there's a complex pattern involving `3`, `5`, `4`, and `6`.\n\n4. **Example 4**: The transformation here is simpler, involving spreading out `3`s into `2`s and `3`s, and then further spreading these.\n\nBased on these observations, the general rule appears to be:\n- Replace specific numbers with other numbers.\n- Spread out the numbers in a pattern.\n- Maintain the structure of the grid while applying the rules.\n\nGiven the complexity, we can generalize that the transformation involves replacing each occurrence of a specific number with a set of numbers and then spreading them out.\n\nLet's apply this to the Test Input:\n\nTest Input:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n\nApplying the transformation:\n- Replace `3` with `2`, `3`, `6`, `8`.\n- Spread out the numbers in a pattern.\n\nThe resulting grid would be:\n```\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>",
