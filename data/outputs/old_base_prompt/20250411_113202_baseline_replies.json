    "00576224": "<thinking>\nTo solve the given problem, we need to identify the transformation rule and then apply it to the test input grid. The transformation rule is that if the first column of the input grid has a higher value than the second column, the first column of the output grid should have a higher value. This means that if the first column has a higher value than the second column, the first column of the output grid should have a higher value than the second column.\n\nLet's apply this rule to the test input grid:\nTest input: [[3, 2], [7, 8]]\n\n1. First column: 3 (higher than 7)\n2. Second column: 2 (lower than 8)\n\nSince the first column has a higher value than the second column, the first column of the output grid should have a higher value than the second column. Therefore, the output grid should be:\n[[3, 2], [7, 8]]\n\n<answer>\n[[3, 2], [7, 8]]\n</answer>",
    "009d5c81": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given examples and apply it to the test input grid. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: \n   - The examples show that each color has a unique number of neighbors.\n   - Each neighbor of a color is represented by a different number in the grid.\n   - We can see that each color has a unique number of neighbors, and each neighbor is represented by a different number in the grid.\n\n2. **Apply the Pattern to the Test Input Grid**:\n   - The test input grid is also a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the grid.\n   - We need to determine which color corresponds to which number in the grid based on the pattern.\n\n3. **Construct the Final Output Grid**:\n   - Based on the pattern, we can construct the final output grid.\n   - For example, if the pattern shows that each color has 3 neighbors, we can assign each color a unique number from 1 to 3.\n\n4. **Format the Output Grid**:\n   - We can format the final output grid as a list of lists in the <answer> tag.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```xml\n<answer>\n    [\n        [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n</answer>\n```",
