{"task_id": "007bbfb7", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet", "raw_response": "<thinking>\nLet me analyze the examples to understand the transformation rule.\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n077\n777\n077\n\nOutput:\n000077077\n000777777\n000077077\n077077077\n777777777\n077077077\n000077077\n000777777\n000077077\n\nI notice that the output is a 9x9 grid. It seems like the original 3x3 input is being placed in different positions of the output grid. Specifically, I see the input pattern in:\n- Top-right corner (columns 6-8, rows 0-2)\n- Middle-center (columns 3-5, rows 3-5)\n- Bottom-left corner (columns 0-2, rows 6-8)\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n404\n000\n040\n\nOutput:\n404000404\n000000000\n040000040\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000404000\n000000000\n000040000\n\nAgain, I see the input pattern in:\n- Top-left corner (columns 0-2, rows 0-2)\n- Top-right corner (columns 6-8, rows 0-2)\n- Bottom-center (columns 3-5, rows 6-8)\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n000\n002\n202\n\nOutput:\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000002\n000000202\n000000000\n002000002\n202000202\n\nHere I see the input pattern in:\n- Bottom-right corner (columns 6-8, rows 6-8)\n- Middle-right (columns 6-8, rows 3-5)\n- Bottom-center (columns 3-5, rows 6-8)\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n660\n600\n066\n\nOutput:\n660660000\n600600000\n066066000\n660000000\n600000000\n066000000\n000660660\n000600600\n000066066\n\nHere I see the input pattern in:\n- Top-left corner (columns 0-2, rows 0-2)\n- Top-center (columns 3-5, rows 0-2)\n- Middle-left (columns 0-2, rows 3-5)\n- Bottom-right corner (columns 6-8, rows 6-8)\n- Bottom-center (columns 3-5, rows 6-8)\n\nExample 5:\nInput:\n222\n000\n022\n\nOutput:\n222222222\n000000000\n022022022\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000222222\n000000000\n000022022\n\nHere I see the input pattern in:\n- Top row, all three positions (columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, rows 0-2)\n- Bottom-center (columns 3-5, rows 6-8)\n- Bottom-right (columns 6-8, rows 6-8)\n\nI'm starting to see a pattern. The rule seems to be:\n1. The output is a 9x9 grid divided into a 3x3 grid of 3x3 cells\n2. The input 3x3 grid is placed in specific positions based on the pattern of non-zero values in the input\n\nLet me check each example again:\n\nExample 1: Input has non-zero values in the middle column and middle row. Output has the input pattern in top-right, middle-center, and bottom-left.\n\nExample 2: Input has non-zero values in the top row and middle column. Output has the input pattern in top-left, top-right, and bottom-center.\n\nExample 3: Input has non-zero values in the bottom row and right column. Output has the input pattern in middle-right, bottom-center, and bottom-right.\n\nExample 4: Input has non-zero values in the left column, top row, and bottom-right. Output has the input pattern in top-left, top-center, middle-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right.\n\nExample 5: Input has non-zero values in the top row and bottom-right. Output has the input pattern in top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-center, and bottom-right.\n\nI think I understand the rule now:\n- For each position in the 3x3 input grid that contains a non-zero value, place the entire input grid in the corresponding position of the 3x3 grid of 3x3 cells in the output.\n\nFor example, if the input has a non-zero value in the top-left corner, then the input grid is placed in the top-left 3x3 cell of the output grid.\n\nLet's apply this to the test input:\n707\n707\n770\n\nThis input has non-zero values in:\n- Top row: positions (0,0), (0,2)\n- Middle row: positions (1,0), (1,2)\n- Bottom row: positions (2,0), (2,1)\n\nSo the output should have the input pattern in:\n- Top-left (due to non-zero at input position 0,0)\n- Top-right (due to non-zero at input position 0,2)\n- Middle-left (due to non-zero at input position 1,0)\n- Middle-right (due to non-zero at input position 1,2)\n- Bottom-left (due to non-zero at input position 2,0)\n- Bottom-center (due to non-zero at input position 2,1)\n\nLet me construct the output grid:\n</thinking>\n\n<thinking>\nLet me construct the 9x9 output grid for the test input:\n707\n707\n770\n\nFirst, I'll create an empty 9x9 grid filled with zeros:\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n\nNow, I'll place the input pattern in the positions corresponding to non-zero values in the input:\n\n1. Top-left (due to 7 at input position 0,0):\n707000000\n707000000\n770000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n\n2. Top-right (due to 7 at input position 0,2):\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n\n3. Middle-left (due to 7 at input position 1,0):\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000000\n707000000\n770000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n\n4. Middle-right (due to 7 at input position 1,2):\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n\n5. Bottom-left (due to 7 at input position 2,0):\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000000\n707000000\n770000000\n\n6. Bottom-center (due to 7 at input position 2,1):\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707707000\n707707000\n770770000\n\nThis should be the final output grid.\n\nLet me double-check by verifying the pattern with the examples again:\n\nExample 1: Input has non-zeros in middle column and middle row. Output has pattern in top-right, middle-center, and bottom-left. \u2713\n\nExample 2: Input has non-zeros in top row and middle column. Output has pattern in top-left, top-right, and bottom-center. \u2713\n\nExample 3: Input has non-zeros in bottom row and right column. Output has pattern in middle-right, bottom-center, and bottom-right. \u2713\n\nExample 4: Input has non-zeros in left column, top row, and bottom-right. Output has pattern in top-left, top-center, middle-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right. \u2713\n\nExample 5: Input has non-zeros in top row and bottom-right. Output has pattern in top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-center, and bottom-right. \u2713\n\nMy solution is consistent with the pattern observed in the examples.\n</thinking>\n\n<thinking>\nI need to be more precise about the rule. Let me re-examine the examples:\n\nThe output is a 9x9 grid that can be viewed as a 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells. The rule seems to be:\n\nFor each position (r,c) in the 3\u00d73 input grid:\n- If the value at position (r,c) is non-zero, then place the entire input grid in the corresponding position of the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nFor example:\n- If input[0][0] is non-zero, place the input in the top-left 3\u00d73 cell of the output\n- If input[0][1] is non-zero, place the input in the top-center 3\u00d73 cell of the output\n- If input[0][2] is non-zero, place the input in the top-right 3\u00d73 cell of the output\n- If input[1][0] is non-zero, place the input in the middle-left 3\u00d73 cell of the output\n- And so on...\n\nLet me verify this with the examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n077\n777\n077\nNon-zero positions: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\nExpected output positions: top-center, top-right, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, bottom-center, bottom-right\nActual output: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left\n\nThis doesn't match my rule. Let me reconsider...\n\nI think the rule might be related to the specific values in the input, not just whether they're non-zero.\n\nLet me look at the examples again, focusing on the specific values:\n\nExample 1:\nInput has 7s in various positions.\nOutput has the input pattern in positions where the original input had 7s.\n\nExample 2:\nInput has 4s in top-left and bottom-right corners, and a 4 in the middle-bottom.\nOutput has the input pattern in top-left, top-right, and bottom-center.\n\nThis doesn't seem to match either.\n\nLet me try a different approach. What if we consider the input as a \"stamp\" and the non-zero values indicate where to stamp the input onto the output grid?\n\nFor Example 1:\nInput:\n077\n777\n077\n\nIf we place this input in the top-left, middle-center, and bottom-right positions of the output grid, and only copy the non-zero values, we get:\n000077077\n000777777\n000077077\n077077077\n777777777\n077077077\n000077077\n000777777\n000077077\n\nThis matches the output!\n\nLet's check Example 2:\nInput:\n404\n000\n040\n\nIf we place this input in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-center positions of the output grid, and only copy the non-zero values, we get:\n404000404\n000000000\n040000040\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000404000\n000000000\n000040000\n\nThis also matches!\n\nI think I've found the rule:\n1. The output is a 9x9 grid\n2. The input is placed in the top-left, top-center, top-right, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, bottom-left, bottom-center, and bottom-right positions of the output grid\n3. For each position in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, it is copied to the corresponding position in the output grid; otherwise, the output grid remains 0 at that position\n\nLet me apply this to the test input:\n707\n707\n770\n\nPlacing this in all 9 positions of the output grid and only copying non-zero values:\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707707000\n707707000\n770770000\n\nThis should be the correct output.\n</thinking>\n\n<thinking>\nI think I've been overcomplicating this. Let me try a simpler approach.\n\nLooking at the examples again, I notice that the output is always a 9\u00d79 grid, which can be viewed as a 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells.\n\nThe rule seems to be:\n- For each position (r,c) in the input grid:\n  - If the value at position (r,c) is non-zero, then copy the entire input grid to the corresponding position in the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nFor example, if input[0][0] is non-zero, then the input grid is copied to the top-left 3\u00d73 cell of the output grid.\n\nLet me verify this with Example 1:\nInput:\n077\n777\n077\n\nNon-zero positions: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\nSo the input should be copied to: top-center, top-right, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, bottom-center, bottom-right\n\nBut the actual output only has the input in: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left\n\nThis still doesn't match. Let me try one more approach.\n\nWhat if the rule is:\n- For each position (r,c) in the input grid:\n  - If the value at position (r,c) is non-zero, then copy the entire input grid to the position (c,r) in the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nThis would mean:\n- If input[0][1] is non-zero, copy to middle-top\n- If input[1][0] is non-zero, copy to left-middle\n- If input[2][2] is non-zero, copy to right-bottom\n\nLet's check Example 1 again:\nInput:\n077\n777\n077\n\nNon-zero positions: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\nUsing the new rule, the input should be copied to: middle-top, right-top, left-middle, middle-middle, right-middle, middle-bottom, right-bottom\n\nBut the actual output has the input in: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left\n\nThis still doesn't match.\n\nLet me try one more approach. What if the rule is based on the specific values in the input?\n\nFor Example 1, the input has 7s. The output has the input pattern in positions where there would be 7s if we expanded the input pattern.\n\nFor Example 2, the input has 4s. The output has the input pattern in positions where there would be 4s if we expanded the input pattern.\n\nThis seems to be the pattern! The rule is:\n- For each unique non-zero value v in the input grid:\n  - Place the input grid in positions of the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells where the value v would be if the input grid was expanded.\n\nLet me verify this with Example 1:\nInput:\n077\n777\n077\n\nThe non-zero value is 7. If we expanded the input pattern, 7s would be in the top-right, middle-center, and bottom-left positions of the 3\u00d73 grid. And indeed, the output has the input pattern in these positions.\n\nLet me check Example 2:\nInput:\n404\n000\n040\n\nThe non-zero value is 4. If we expanded the input pattern, 4s would be in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-center positions of the 3\u00d73 grid. And indeed, the output has the input pattern in these positions.\n\nThis rule seems to work for all examples. Let me apply it to the test input:\n707\n707\n770\n\nThe non-zero value is 7. If we expanded the input pattern, 7s would be in the top-left, top-right, middle-left, middle-right, bottom-left, and bottom-center positions of the 3\u00d73 grid. So the output should have the input pattern in these positions.\n\nLet me construct the output grid:\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707707000\n707707000\n770770000\n\nThis should be the correct output.\n</thinking>\n\nI need to analyze the transformation pattern in these examples.\n\n<thinking>\nLooking at the examples carefully, I notice that the output is always a 9\u00d79 grid, which can be viewed as a 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells.\n\nThe key insight is that the input grid itself determines where copies of itself will appear in the output grid. Specifically:\n- For each non-zero value in the input grid at position (r,c), the entire input grid is copied to the corresponding position in the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nFor example, if input[0][0] is non-zero, then the input grid is copied to the top-left 3\u00d73 cell of the output grid.\n\nLet me verify this with Example 1:\n```\n077\n777\n077\n```\n\nNon-zero positions: (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\nSo the input should be copied to: top-center, top-right, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, bottom-center, bottom-right\n\nBut the actual output only has the input in: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left\n\nI need to look more carefully. Let me check if the rule is actually:\n- For each position (r,c) in the input grid with a specific non-zero value (e.g., 7 in Example 1), place the input grid in the corresponding position of the output grid.\n\nFor Example 1, the value is 7, and 7 appears in positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).\nBut the output has the input in positions: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left.\n\nThis doesn't match either. Let me try a different approach.\n\nWhat if we consider the pattern of non-zero values in the input as a \"mask\" that determines where to place the input in the output?\n\nFor Example 1:\n```\n077\n777\n077\n```\n\nIf we view this as a mask, it forms a cross shape. The output has the input in the top-right, middle-center, and bottom-left positions, which also forms a diagonal.\n\nFor Example 2:\n```\n404\n000\n040\n```\n\nThe mask forms a pattern with 4s in the corners and middle-bottom. The output has the input in the top-left, top-right, and bottom-center positions.\n\nI think I see the pattern now! The rule is:\n- For each unique non-zero value v in the input grid:\n  - For each position (r,c) where the input grid has value v:\n    - Place the entire input grid in the position (r,c) of the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nLet me verify this with Example 1:\nInput has 7s at positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).\nOutput should have the input at positions: top-center, top-right, middle-left, middle-center, middle-right, bottom-center, bottom-right.\n\nBut the actual output has the input at: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left.\n\nThis still doesn't match. Let me try one more approach.\n\nWhat if the rule is:\n- For each position (r,c) in the input grid:\n  - If the value at position (r,c) is non-zero, then place the entire input grid in the position (c,r) of the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nFor Example 1:\nInput has non-zero values at positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).\nUsing the transposed rule, the input should be placed at positions: (1,0)=middle-top, (2,0)=right-top, (0,1)=left-middle, (1,1)=middle-middle, (2,1)=right-middle, (1,2)=middle-bottom, (2,2)=right-bottom.\n\nBut the actual output has the input at: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left.\n\nI need to look more carefully at the examples.\n\nLet me try a different approach. What if the rule is based on the specific values in the input?\n\nFor Example 1, the input has 7s. If I look at where 7s appear in the input:\n```\n077\n777\n077\n```\n\n7s appear at positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).\n\nThe output has the input pattern in positions: top-right, middle-center, bottom-left.\n\nThese positions correspond to (0,2), (1,1), (2,0) in the 3\u00d73 grid.\n\nI notice that these positions form a diagonal in the 3\u00d73 grid. This might be a clue.\n\nLet me check Example 2:\n```\n404\n000\n040\n```\n\n4s appear at positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,1).\n\nThe output has the input pattern in positions: top-left, top-right, bottom-center.\n\nThese positions correspond to (0,0), (0,2), (2,1) in the 3\u00d73 grid.\n\nThis matches exactly! The rule is:\n- For each position (r,c) in the input grid with a specific non-zero value (e.g., 7 in Example 1, 4 in Example 2), place the input grid in the position (r,c) of the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nLet me verify this with the other examples:\n\nExample 3:\n```\n000\n002\n202\n```\n\n2s appear at positions (1,2), (2,0), (2,2).\nOutput has the input at positions: middle-right, bottom-left, bottom-right.\nThese positions correspond to (1,2), (2,0), (2,2) in the 3\u00d73 grid. \u2713\n\nExample 4:\n```\n660\n600\n066\n```\n\n6s appear at positions (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (2,1), (2,2).\nOutput has the input at positions: top-left, top-center, middle-left, bottom-center, bottom-right.\nThese positions correspond to (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (2,1), (2,2) in the 3\u00d73 grid. \u2713\n\nExample 5:\n```\n222\n000\n022\n```\n\n2s appear at positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (2,1), (2,2).\nOutput has the input at positions: top-left, top-center, top-right, bottom-center, bottom-right.\nThese positions correspond to (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (2,1), (2,2) in the 3\u00d73 grid. \u2713\n\nThe rule is confirmed! Now let me apply it to the test input:\n```\n707\n707\n770\n```\n\n7s appear at positions (0,0), (0,2), (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1).\nSo the output should have the input at positions: top-left, top-right, middle-left, middle-right, bottom-left, bottom-center.\n\nLet me construct the output grid:\n```\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707000707\n707000707\n770000770\n707707000\n707707000\n770770000\n```\n\nThis should be the correct output.\n</thinking>\n\nLooking at all the examples, I notice a pattern in how the input grid is transformed into the output grid:\n\n1. The output is always a 9\u00d79 grid, which can be viewed as a 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells.\n2. The rule is: For each position (r,c) in the input grid that contains a non-zero value, place a copy of the entire input grid in the corresponding position of the 3\u00d73 grid of 3\u00d73 cells in the output.\n\nFor example:\n- If input[0][0] is non-zero, place the input in the top-left 3\u00d73 cell of the output\n- If input[1][2] is non-zero, place the input in the middle-right 3\u00d73 cell of the output\n\nLet me apply this to the test input:\n```\n707\n707\n770\n```\n\nNon-zero positions are:\n- (0,0), (0,2): top-left and top-right\n- (1,0), (1,2): middle-left and middle-right\n- (2,0), (2,1): bottom-left and bottom-center\n\nSo I need to place the input grid in these six positions of the output grid.\n\n<answer>\n[[7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7],\n[7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7],\n[7,7,0,0,0,0,7,7,0],\n[7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7],\n[7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7],\n[7,7,0,0,0,0,7,7,0],\n[7,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0],\n[7,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0],\n[7,7,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 561, "completion_tokens": 6302, "model_answer": [[7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "correct": true, "total_tokens": 6863}

Let `Subgrid[r][c]` be the 3x3 subgrid in the output corresponding to the input cell `I[r][c]`. `Subgrid[r][c]` occupies rows `3*r` to `3*r+2` and columns `3*c` to `3*c+2` in the output grid `O`.\n\n3.  **Examine Example 1:**\n    Input `I`: `[[0,7,7],[7,7,7],[0,7,7]]`\n    Output `O`: (Visualized as 3x3 subgrids)\n    ```\n    [[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], [[0,7,7],[7,7,7],[0,7,7]], [[0,7,7],[7,7,7],[0,7,7]]],\n    [[[0,7,7],[7,7,7],[0,7,7]], [[0,7,7],[7,7,7],[0,7,7]], [[0,7,7],[7,7,7],[0,7,7]]],\n    [[[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], [[0,7,7],[7,7,7],[0,7,7]], [[0,7,7],[7,7,7],[0,7,7]]]\n    ```\n    Let `B = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]` (Black 3x3 grid).\n    The subgrids are arranged as:\n    ```\n    B I I\n    I I I\n    B I I\n    ```\n    Comparing this arrangement with the input grid `I`:\n    ```\n    0 7 7\n    7 7 7\n    0 7 7\n    ```\n    It appears that if `I[r][c]` is 0, then `Subgrid[r][c]` is `B`. If `I[r][c]` is non-zero (7 in this case), then `Subgrid[r][c]` is the original input grid `I`.\n\n4.  **Verify the Rule with Other Examples:**\n    *   **Example 2:** `I = [[4,0,4],[0,0,0],[0,4,0]]`. Expected subgrid arrangement: `I B I / B B B / B I B`. This matches the output.\n    *   **Example 3:** `I = [[0,0,0],[0,0,2],[2,0,2]]`. Expected subgrid arrangement: `B B B / B B I / I B I`. This matches the output.\n    *   **Example 4:** `I = [[6,6,0],[6,0,0],[0,6,6]]`. Expected subgrid arrangement: `I I B / I B B / B I I`. This matches the output.\n    *   **Example 5:** `I = [[2,2,2],[0,0,0],[0,2,2]]`. Expected subgrid arrangement: `I I I / B B B / B I I`. This matches the output.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Transformation Rule:**\n    a.  Create an output grid that is 3 times the height and 3 times the width of the input grid.\n    b.  Define two 3x3 template grids: the original input grid `I` and a 3x3 grid filled with zeros `B`.\n    c.  Iterate through each cell `I[r][c]` of the input grid (from `r=0` to `2`, `c=0` to `2`).\n    d.  If `I[r][c]` is 0, place the black grid `B` into the output grid at the position corresponding to `(r, c)`, i.e., covering rows `3*r` to `3*r+2` and columns `3*c` to `3*c+2`.\n    e.  If `I[r][c]` is non-zero, place the original input grid `I` into the output grid at the position corresponding to `(r, c)`.\n\n6.  **Apply the Rule to the Test Input:**\n    Test Input `I`:\n    ```\n    707\n    707\n    770\n    ```\n    `I = [[7,0,7],[7,0,7],[7,7,0]]`\n    Black Grid `B`:\n    ```\n    000\n    000\n    000\n    ```\n    `B = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]`\n\n    Determine the subgrid arrangement based on `I`:\n    *   `I[0][0] = 7` (non-zero) -> `Subgrid[0][0] = I`\n    *   `I[0][1] = 0` (zero) -> `Subgrid[0][1] = B`\n    *   `I[0][2] = 7` (non-zero) -> `Subgrid[0][2] = I`\n    *   `I[1][0] = 7` (non-zero) -> `Subgrid[1][0] = I`\n    *   `I[1][1] = 0` (zero) -> `Subgrid[1][1] = B`\n    *   `I[1][2] = 7` (non-zero) -> `Subgrid[1][2] = I`\n    *   `I[2][0] = 7` (non-zero) -> `Subgrid[2][0] = I`\n    *   `I[2][1] = 7` (non-zero) -> `Subgrid[2][1] = I`\n    *   `I[2][2] = 0` (zero) -> `Subgrid[2][2] = B`\n\n    Arrangement:\n    ```\n    I B I\n    I B I\n    I I B\n    ```\n\n    Construct the 9x9 output grid:\n    Rows 0-2: `I` | `B` | `I`\n    ```\n    707 000 707\n    707 000 707\n    770 000 770\n    ```\n    Rows 3-5: `I` | `B` | `I`\n    ```\n    707 000 707\n    707 000 707\n    770 000 770\n    ```\n    Rows 6-8: `I` | `I` | `B`\n    ```\n    707 707 000\n    707 707 000\n    770 770 000\n    ```\n\n    Combine into the final grid:\n    ```\n    707000707\n    707000707\n    770000770\n    707000707\n    707000707\n    770000770\n    707707000\n    707707000\n    770770000\n    ```\n\n7.  **Format the Output:**\n    Convert the final grid into a JSON list of lists.\n    ```json\n    [\n      [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n      [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n      [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0],\n      [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n      [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n      [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0],\n      [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n      [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n      [7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    ```\n    The logic seems sound and consistent across all examples.\n```</thinking>\n\n```<answer>\n[\n  [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n  [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n  [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0],\n  [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n  [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7],\n  [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0],\n  [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n  [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0],\n  [7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n```</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 835, "completion_tokens": 7670, "model_answer": [[7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "correct": true, "total_tokens": 8505}

The red shape remains stationary.\n\n4.  **Refine Hypothesis - Calculate Shift:**\n    *   Identify blue pixels `P_b` and red pixels `P_r`.\n    *   Find bounding boxes: Blue `(min_r_b, min_c_b)` to `(max_r_b, max_c_b)`, Red `(min_r_r, min_c_r)` to `(max_r_r, max_c_r)`.\n    *   Determine primary axis:\n        *   Vertical if `max_r_b < min_r_r` (Blue above Red) or `max_r_r < min_r_b` (Red above Blue).\n        *   Horizontal if `max_c_b < min_c_r` (Blue left of Red) or `max_c_r < min_c_b` (Red left of Blue).\n    *   Calculate shift `(dr, dc)` to achieve adjacency:\n        *   Blue above Red: `dr = (min_r_r - 1) - max_r_b`, `dc = 0`.\n        *   Red above Blue: `dr = (max_r_r + 1) - min_r_b`, `dc = 0`.\n        *   Blue left of Red: `dc = (min_c_r - 1) - max_c_b`, `dr = 0`.\n        *   Red left of Blue: `dc = (max_c_r + 1) - min_c_b`, `dr = 0`.\n\n5.  **Verify Hypothesis with Examples:**\n    *   Ex 1 (Blue above Red): `dr = (10 - 1) - 3 = 6`. Matches.\n    *   Ex 2 (Blue left of Red): `dc = (6 - 1) - 3 = 2`. Does NOT match observed shift of 3.\n\n6.  **Re-evaluate Hypothesis - Pixel Adjacency:** The bounding box adjacency might be insufficient. Let's consider the minimum shift required for any blue pixel to become adjacent to a red pixel along the primary axis.\n    *   Define distance based on pixels in common rows/columns.\n    *   Blue above Red: `dr = min(r_r - r_b - 1)` over pairs `(r_b, c)` in `P_b`, `(r_r, c)` in `P_r`. (If no common column, use BB formula).\n    *   Red above Blue: `dr = max(r_r - r_b + 1)` over pairs `(r_b, c)` in `P_b`, `(r_r, c)` in `P_r`. (If no common column, use BB formula). Note: `max` is used because `dr` will be negative; we want the smallest upward shift, which means the largest negative value (closest to 0).\n    *   Blue left of Red: `dc = min(c_r - c_b - 1)` over pairs `(r, c_b)` in `P_b`, `(r, c_r)` in `P_r`. (If no common row, use BB formula).\n    *   Red left of Blue: `dc = max(c_r - c_b + 1)` over pairs `(r, c_b)` in `P_b`, `(r, c_r)` in `P_r`. (If no common row, use BB formula). Note: `max` is used because `dc` will be negative.\n\n7.  **Verify Pixel Adjacency Hypothesis:**\n    *   Ex 1 (Blue above Red): Common col c=3. Blue (2,3), (3,3). Red (10,3), (11,3). Distances `r_r - r_b - 1`: `10-2-1=7`, `11-2-1=8`, `10-3-1=6`, `11-3-1=7`. Min distance = 6. `dr=6`. Matches.\n    *   Ex 2 (Blue left of Red): Common row r=4. Blue (4,1), (4,2). Red (4,6), (4,7). Distances `c_r - c_b - 1`: `6-1-1=4`, `7-1-1=5`, `6-2-1=3`, `7-2-1=4`. Min distance = 3. `dc=3`. Matches observed shift.\n    *   Ex 3 (Red above Blue): Common cols c=3, c=4.\n        c=3: Red (1,3), (2,3). Blue (6,3), (7,3), (8,3).

Distances `r_r - r_b + 1`: `1-6+1=-4`, `2-6+1=-3`, `1-7+1=-5`, `2-7+1=-4`.\n        Max distance (closest to 0) is -3. `dr=-3`.

It moves vertically downwards until it is directly above the red object (no empty rows between their bounding boxes, or more precisely, until the minimum vertical distance between a blue pixel and a red pixel is 1).\n    *   **Example 2:** The blue object is initially to the left of the red object (with some vertical overlap in row 4). It moves horizontally to the right until it is directly adjacent to the red object (no empty columns between them, minimum horizontal distance is 1).\n    *   **Example 3:** The blue object is initially below the red object. It moves vertically upwards until it is directly below the red object (minimum vertical distance is 1).\n\n*   **Hypothesize Rule:** The red object is stationary. The blue object moves towards the red object along a single axis (either horizontal or vertical) until they are adjacent (Manhattan distance of 1 between the closest pair of blue and red pixels). The direction of movement is determined by the axis along which the minimum Manhattan distance between any blue pixel and any red pixel occurs.\n\n*   **Refine Rule - Determining Axis and Distance:**\n    1.  Find all coordinates of blue pixels (B) and red pixels (R).\n    2.  Calculate the Manhattan distance `d(b, r) = |b_row - r_row| + |b_col - r_col|` for every pair of blue pixel `b` and red pixel `r`.\n    3.  Find the minimum Manhattan distance `d_min` among all pairs.\n    4.  Identify the pair(s) `(b_min, r_min)` that achieve this minimum distance.\n    5.  Calculate the vector `v = (r_min_row - b_min_row, r_min_col - b_min_col) = (delta_row, delta_col)`. Note: `|delta_row| + |delta_col| = d_min`.\n    6.  Based on the examples, the minimum distance vector seems to be purely axial (either `delta_row` is 0 or `delta_col` is 0).\n        *   If `delta_row != 0` and `delta_col == 0` (minimum distance is purely vertical): Move the blue object vertically by `|delta_row| - 1` steps. Move down if `delta_row > 0` (red below blue), move up if `delta_row < 0` (red above blue).\n        *   If `delta_row == 0` and `delta_col != 0` (minimum distance is purely horizontal): Move the blue object horizontally by `|delta_col| - 1` steps. Move right if `delta_col > 0` (red right of blue), move left if `delta_col < 0` (red left of blue).\n    7.  If multiple pairs give the same `d_min`, and one is purely vertical while another is purely horizontal, we need a tie-breaker. However, the examples suggest the minimum distance vector is unique in terms of its axial direction. Let's assume the minimum distance vector will clearly indicate horizontal or vertical movement.\n\n*   **Verify Rule with Examples:**\n    *   **Ex 1:** Closest pair: Blue(3,3), Red(10,3). Vector = (10-3, 3-3) = (7, 0). `d_min = 7`. Vertical movement. `delta_row = 7 > 0`. Move down by `|7| - 1 = 6`. Correct.\n    *   **Ex 2:** Closest pair: Blue(4,2), Red(4,6). Vector = (4-4, 6-2) = (0, 4). `d_min = 4`. Horizontal movement. `delta_col = 4 > 0`. Move right by `|4| - 1 = 3`. Correct.\n    *   **Ex 3:** Closest pair: Blue(6,3), Red(2,3). Vector = (2-6, 3-3) = (-4, 0). `d_min = 4`. Vertical movement. `delta_row = -4 < 0`. Move up by `|-4| - 1 = 3`. Correct.\n\n**2.

The output's top half (rows 0-4) uses color 6, and the bottom half (rows 5-9) uses color 7.\n    *   In Example 2, the input has color 1 at (2, 6) and color 4 at (7, 4). The output's top half uses color 1, and the bottom half uses color 4.\n    *   It appears the color found in the top half of the input grid dictates the color used for the top half of the output grid (let's call this C1).\n    *   Similarly, the color found in the bottom half of the input grid dictates the color used for the bottom half of the output grid (let's call this C2). The exact (row, col) position within each half doesn't seem to affect the output pattern, only the color value itself.\n\n3.  **Determine the Transformation Rule:**\n    *   **Step 1: Identify Colors C1 and C2.** Scan the input grid. Find the non-zero color in rows 0-4; this is C1. Find the non-zero color in rows 5-9; this is C2.\n    *   **Step 2: Construct the Output Grid (10x10).**\n    *   **Step 3: Fill the Top Half (Rows 0-4) using C1.**\n        *   Row 0: Fill entirely with C1.\n        *   Row 1: Set column 0 and column 9 to C1, fill the rest with 0.\n        *   Row 2: Fill entirely with C1.\n        *   Row 3: Set column 0 and column 9 to C1, fill the rest with 0.\n        *   Row 4: Set column 0 and column 9 to C1, fill the rest with 0.\n    *   **Step 4: Fill the Bottom Half (Rows 5-9) using C2.**\n        *   Row 5: Set column 0 and column 9 to C2, fill the rest with 0.\n        *   Row 6: Set column 0 and column 9 to C2, fill the rest with 0.\n        *   Row 7: Fill entirely with C2.\n        *   Row 8: Set column 0 and column 9 to C2, fill the rest with 0.\n        *   Row 9: Fill entirely with C2.\n\n4.  **Verify Rule with Examples:**\n    *   **Example 1:** Input has 6 in top half, 7 in bottom half.

It's possible there's a typo in the provided Example 1 output or input, or there's a more complex rule I'm missing. However, given that 2 out of 3 examples strongly support the simple bounding box rule, and it's a very common ARC pattern, I will proceed with this rule. The discrepancy in Example 1 might be an error in the problem description. Assuming the rule is the minimal bounding box based on non-zero cells.\n\n8.  **Apply the Simple Bounding Box Rule to the Test Input:**\n    *   Test Input Grid: 12x12\n        ```\n        ...\n        000066660000  (Row 4)\n        000060000000  (Row 5)\n        006060000000  (Row 6)\n        006666000000  (Row 7)\n        ...\n        ```\n    *   Identify non-zero cells (color 6):\n        *   Row 4: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n        *   Row 5: (5,4)\n        *   Row 6: (6,2), (6,4)\n        *   Row 7: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)\n    *   Find min/max row indices:\n        *   Rows involved: 4, 5, 6, 7\n        *   `min_r` = 4\n        *   `max_r` = 7\n    *   Find min/max column indices:\n        *   Columns involved: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n        *   `min_c` = 2\n        *   `max_c` = 7\n    *   Extract the subgrid defined by rows 4-7 and columns 2-7.\n    *   Row 4, Cols 2-7: `006666`\n    *   Row 5, Cols 2-7: `006000`\n    *   Row 6, Cols 2-7: `606000`\n    *   Row 7, Cols 2-7: `666600`\n    *   The resulting output grid is 4x6.\n\n9.  **Format the Output:**\n    *   The final grid needs to be in JSON format (list of lists).\n    ```json\n    [[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]\n    ```\n10. **Final Sanity Check:** The rule is simple and common. It fits 2/3 examples perfectly. Applying it to the test case yields a plausible result. The dimensions are determined solely by the extent of the non-zero pixels.```thinking\n1.  **Goal:** Determine the transformation rule from the input/output examples and apply it to the test input.\n\n2.  **Analyze Examples:**\n    *   **Example 1:** Input 10x12 -> Output 4x4. Contains a shape of color 2.\n    *   **Example 2:** Input 11x12 -> Output 5x3. Contains a shape of color 1.\n    *   **Example 3:** Input 13x12 -> Output 3x5. Contains a shape of color 8.\n    *   **Observation:** The output grid is always smaller than the input grid and contains the non-zero colored shape from the input. This strongly suggests a cropping operation based on the content.\n\n3.  **Hypothesis:** The transformation extracts the smallest rectangular bounding box that encloses all non-zero cells in the input grid.\n\n4.  **Verify Hypothesis with Example 1:**\n    *   Input non-zero cells (color 2): (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,5), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6).\n    *   Row indices: 2, 3, 4, 5. Min row = 2, Max row = 5.\n    *   Column indices: 4, 5, 6. Min col = 4, Max col = 6.\n    *   Bounding box: Rows 2-5, Columns 4-6.\n    *   Extracted subgrid:\n        ```\n        222\n        020\n        222\n        202\n        ```\n    *   This is a 4x3 grid.\n    *   The provided Example 1 Output is 4x4:\n        ```\n        0222\n        0020\n        2220\n        2020\n        ```\n    *   Comparing the output to the input grid, the output matches the subgrid defined by Rows 2-5 and Columns 3-6.\n    *   This contradicts the simple bounding box hypothesis based solely on non-zero cells (min_c=4). Let's hold this observation and check other examples.\n\n5.  **Verify Hypothesis with Example 2:**\n    *   Input non-zero cells (color 1): (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3), (4,4), (5,4).\n    *   Row indices: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Min col = 2, Max col = 4.\n    *   Bounding box: Rows 1-5, Columns 2-4.\n    *   Extracted subgrid:\n        ```\n        100\n        110\n        010\n        111\n        001\n        ```\n    *   This 5x3 grid exactly matches the Example 2 Output. This supports the simple bounding box hypothesis.\n\n6.  **Verify Hypothesis with Example 3:**\n    *   Input non-zero cells (color 8): (3,4), (3,6), (4,3), (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,6), (5,7).\n    *   Row indices: 3, 4, 5. Min row = 3, Max row = 5.\n    *   Column indices: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Min col = 3, Max col = 7.\n    *   Bounding box: Rows 3-5, Columns 3-7.\n    *   Extracted subgrid:\n        ```\n        08080\n        88880\n        00088\n        ```\n    *   This 3x5 grid exactly matches the Example 3 Output. This also supports the simple bounding box hypothesis.\n\n7.  **Refine Rule:** The simple bounding box rule (extract the rectangle defined by the minimum and maximum row and column indices containing non-zero cells) works for Examples 2 and 3. Example 1 seems anomalous as presented; the output shown corresponds to rows 2-5 and columns 3-6, while the non-zero cells are strictly within columns 4-6. Given the strong evidence from Examples 2 and 3, I will assume the intended rule is the standard minimal bounding box of non-zero cells. The discrepancy in Example 1 might be an error in the problem statement.\n\n8.  **Apply Rule to Test Input:**\n    *   Input Grid: 12x12, non-zero color is 6.\n    *   Identify non-zero cells:\n        *   Row 4: (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7)\n        *   Row 5: (5,4)\n        *   Row 6: (6,2), (6,4)\n        *   Row 7: (7,2), (7,3), (7,4), (7,5)\n    *   Determine bounding box coordinates:\n        *   Row indices: 4, 5, 6, 7. Min row (`min_r`) = 4, Max row (`max_r`) = 7.\n        *   Column indices: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Min col (`min_c`) = 2, Max col (`max_c`) = 7.\n    *   Extract the subgrid from the input using rows `min_r` to `max_r` (4 to 7) and columns `min_c` to `max_c` (2 to 7).\n    *   Extracted rows:\n        *   Row 4: `000066660000` -> Slice cols 2-7: `006666`\n        *   Row 5: `000060000000` -> Slice cols 2-7: `006000`\n        *   Row 6: `006060000000` -> Slice cols 2-7: `606000`\n        *   Row 7: `006666000000` -> Slice cols 2-7: `666600`\n    *   Resulting output grid (4x6):\n        ```\n        006666\n        006000\n        606000\n        666600\n        ```\n\n9.  **Format Output:** Convert the resulting grid into the required JSON list of lists format.\n```json\n[[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]\n```\n```\n\n```answer\n[[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]]\n```", "prompt_tokens": 932, "completion_tokens": 7890, "model_answer": [[0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0]], "correct": true, "total_tokens": 8822}

These cells are part of a larger block of 8s. The new colors (9, 6, 4) correspond to other non-zero colors present in the same column or row as the changed cell: 9 is at (0,4), 6 is at (6,0), 4 is at (9,5).\n    -   Example 2: Cells (3,3), (3,4), (5,5), (7,3), (7,5) change from 8 to 6, 7, 2, 3, 1 respectively. Again, these are part of the main block of 8s. The new colors correspond to influencers: 6 at (3,0), 7 at (0,4), 2 at (5,9), 3 at (7,0), 1 at (9,5).\n    -   Example 3: Cells (3,3), (3,5), (4,3), (6,3), (7,3), (7,5) change from 8 to 4, 6, 3, 2, 7, 2 respectively. The pattern holds: 4 at (0,3), 6 at (3,9), 3 at (4,0), 2 at (6,0), 7 at (9,3), 2 at (7,9).\n\n2.  **Identify the Core Object:**\n    In all examples, the changes occur within the largest connected component of non-black cells (using 4-connectivity). Let's call this the 'main component' and its color 'C'. All other non-black cells are 'influencers'.\n\n3.  **Determine the Transformation Rule:**\n    The changes seem to happen at specific cells within the main component, influenced by external colors in the same row or column. Let's test the hypothesis that only the \"outermost\" cells of the component in a given row/column are affected.\n    -   A cell (r, c) with color C changes if it's the top-most cell of color C in its column `c`, AND there's an influencer cell above it in the same column.\n    -   A cell (r, c) with color C changes if it's the bottom-most cell of color C in its column `c`, AND there's an influencer cell below it in the same column.\n    -   A cell (r, c) with color C changes if it's the left-most cell of color C in its row `r`, AND there's an influencer cell to its left in the same row.\n    -   A cell (r, c) with color C changes if it's the right-most cell of color C in its row `r`, AND there's an influencer cell to its right in the same row.\n\n    Let's verify this with Example 1:\n    -   (3, 4): Color 8. Top-most 8 in col 4? Yes (input[2][4]=0). Influencer above? Yes, 9 at (0,4). Change to 9. Correct.\n    -   (6, 4): Color 8. Bottom-most 8 in col 4? Yes (input[7][4]=0). Influencer below? No. Left-most 8 in row 6? Yes (input[6][3]=0). Influencer left? Yes, 6 at (6,0). Change to 6. Correct.\n    -   (6, 5): Color 8. Bottom-most 8 in col 5? Yes (input[7][5]=0). Influencer below? Yes, 4 at (9,5). Change to 4. Correct.\n\n    What if multiple conditions apply? The examples suggest only one change happens per cell. Let's establish an order of checking: Up, Down, Left, Right. The first condition met triggers the change.\n    -   Ex 1 (6, 4): Check Up? No. Check Down? No influencer below. Check Left? Yes, influencer 6 at (6,0) and (6,4) is left-most 8 in row 6. Change to 6. Stop. (Matches output).\n    -   Ex 1 (6, 5): Check Up? No. Check Down? Yes, influencer 4 at (9,5) and (6,5) is bottom-most 8 in col 5. Change to 4. Stop. (Matches output).\n\n    This ordered rule (Up, Down, Left, Right) works for all examples provided.\n\n4.  **Formalize the Algorithm:**\n    a.  Find the largest connected component of non-black cells. Determine its color `C` and the set of coordinates `ComponentCells`.\n    b.  Create a copy of the input grid, `OutputGrid`.\n    c.  Identify all influencer cells: coordinates `(r_inf, c_inf)` where `InputGrid[r_inf][c_inf] != 0` and `InputGrid[r_inf][c_inf] != C`.\n    d.  For each cell `(r, c)` in `ComponentCells`:\n        i.  `changed = false`\n        ii. **Check Up:** Find influencer `(r_inf, c)` where `r_inf < r`. If exists AND `(r, c)` is top-most C in col `c` (i.e., `r == 0` or `InputGrid[r-1][c] != C`): `OutputGrid[r][c] = InputGrid[r_inf][c]`; `changed = true`. Use the influencer closest to `(r,c)` if multiple exist above.\n        iii. **Check Down:** If not `changed`: Find influencer `(r_inf, c)` where `r_inf > r`. If exists AND `(r, c)` is bottom-most C in col `c` (i.e., `r == H-1` or `InputGrid[r+1][c] != C`): `OutputGrid[r][c] = InputGrid[r_inf][c]`; `changed = true`. Use the closest influencer.\n        iv. **Check Left:** If not `changed`: Find influencer `(r, c_inf)` where `c_inf < c`. If exists AND `(r, c)` is left-most C in row `r` (i.e., `c == 0` or `InputGrid[r][c-1] != C`): `OutputGrid[r][c] = InputGrid[r][c_inf]`; `changed = true`. Use the closest influencer.\n        v.  **Check Right:** If not `changed`: Find influencer `(r, c_inf)` where `c_inf > c`. If exists AND `(r, c)` is right-most C in row `r` (i.e., `c == W-1` or `InputGrid[r][c+1] != C`): `OutputGrid[r][c] = InputGrid[r][c_inf]`; `changed = true`. Use the closest influencer.\n    e.  Return `OutputGrid`.\n    *(Note: The examples don't explicitly test multiple influencers in one direction; assuming the closest one applies or only one exists per direction relative to the edge cell.)*\n\n5.  **Apply the Algorithm to the Test Input:**\n    Input:\n    ```\n    0006020000\n    0000000000\n    0000000000\n    9088880000\n    0088880007\n    3088880000\n    4088880000\n    0000000000\n    0000000000\n    0000600000\n    ```\n    a.

The colors correspond to colors present in the input grid.\n    *   The background is black (0).\n    *   In the input grids, each non-black color appears exactly twice.\n    *   The output grid seems to be generated by drawing lines between the pairs of same-colored points found in the input.\n    *   The original points from the input are not necessarily all present in the output unless they fall on the drawn line. The output grid appears to be constructed from scratch by drawing these lines.\n\n2.  **Identify the Pattern/Rule:**\n    *   For each color C present in the input, find the coordinates of the two cells containing C. Let them be P1 = (r1, c1) and P2 = (r2, c2).\n    *   Assume, without loss of generality, that r1 <= r2.

(This handles vertical lines where dc=0 correctly, assuming sc=1).\n    *   The line segment consists of points (row, col) generated by starting at P1 and taking `dr` steps. Each step increments the row by 1 and the column by `sc`.\n    *   The points on the line are: `(r1 + i, c1 + i * sc)` for `i` from 0 to `dr`.\n    *   Draw these points onto an initially black output grid using color C.\n\n3.  **Verify the Rule with Examples:**\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Color 2: P1=(0, 2), P2=(2, 0). r1=0, c1=2, r2=2, c2=0. dr=2, dc=-2, sc=-1.

This suggests a scaling factor of 3, likely involving replacing each input cell with a 3x3 block.\n    *   Identify the background color: In all examples, the color 0 seems to act as a background or default color.\n    *   Examine the structure of the output grid: The 9x9 output grid appears to be composed of nine 3x3 subgrids or blocks. Let the input grid be `I` and the output grid be `O`. The block at block coordinates `(br, bc)` in `O` (where `br, bc` are 0, 1, or 2) seems to correspond to the input cell `I[br][bc]`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Rule for Block Generation:**\n    *   **Example 1:** Input `I = [[0,7,7], [7,7,7], [0,7,7]]`.\n        *   `I[0][0] = 0`. The top-left 3x3 block in the output is `[[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]]`.\n        *   `I[0][1] = 7`. The top-middle 3x3 block in the output is `[[0,7,7], [7,7,7], [0,7,7]]`, which is identical to the original input grid `I`.\n        *   `I[1][0] = 7`. The middle-left 3x3 block is also a copy of `I`.\n        *   `I[1][1] = 7`. The center 3x3 block is also a copy of `I`.\n    *   **Example 2:** Input `I = [[4,0,4], [0,0,0], [0,4,0]]`.\n        *   `I[0][0] = 4`. The top-left 3x3 block is `[[4,0,4], [0,0,0], [0,4,0]]`, a copy of `I`.\n        *   `I[0][1] = 0`. The top-middle 3x3 block is `[[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]]`.\n        *   `I[1][1] = 0`. The center 3x3 block is `[[0,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,0]]`.\n        *   `I[2][1] = 4`. The bottom-middle 3x3 block is `[[4,0,4], [0,0,0], [0,4,0]]`, a copy of `I`.\n    *   **Hypothesis:** The rule is: Iterate through each cell `I[r][c]` of the input grid. If `I[r][c]` is the background color (0), the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid (at rows `3r` to `3r+2` and columns `3c` to `3c+2`) is filled with the background color (0). If `I[r][c]` is a non-background color, the corresponding 3x3 block in the output grid is a copy of the *entire original input grid* `I`.\n\n3.  **Verify the Rule with Other Examples:**\n    *   Example 3: Input `[[0,0,0], [0,0,2], [2,0,2]]`. Cells with 0 become 3x3 zero blocks. Cells with 2 become copies of the input grid. This matches the output.\n    *   Example 4: Input `[[6,6,0], [6,0,0], [0,6,6]]`. Cells with 0 become 3x3 zero blocks. Cells with 6 become copies of the input grid. This matches the output.\n    *   Example 5: Input `[[2,2,2], [0,0,0], [0,2,2]]`.

Could it be that the third block takes rows from T(B1) and T(B2)?\n        OB3 = [ T(B1) row 1, T(B2) row 1, T(B1) row 3 ] ?\n        T(B1) row 1 = `020`\n        T(B2) row 1 = `022`\n        T(B1) row 3 = `020`\n        Stacking these gives:\n        ```\n        020\n        022\n        020\n        ```\n        This matches OB3 for Example 1!\n\n        Let's test this new hypothesis: Output = T(B1) + T(B2) + [ T(B1) row 1, T(B2) row 1, T(B1) row 3 ]\n\n        Test on Example 2:\n        T(B1): `[[0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]]`\n        T(B2): `[[2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,2]]`\n        OB1 = T(B1) (Matches)\n        OB2 = T(B2) (Matches)\n        Construct OB3 = [ T(B1) row 1, T(B2) row 1, T(B1) row 3 ]\n        T(B1) row 1 = `020`\n        T(B2) row 1 = `202`\n        T(B1) row 3 = `020`\n        Constructed OB3:\n        ```\n        020\n        202\n        020\n        ```\n        Actual Example 2 OB3:\n        ```\n        020\n        202\n        020\n        ```\n        It matches! Note that in this case, Constructed OB3 happens to be equal to T(B1). This explains why the simpler rule T(B1)+T(B2)+T(B1) seemed to work initially for Example 2.\n\n        Test on Example 3:\n        T(B1): `[[0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]]`\n        T(B2): `[[0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]]` (T(B1) = T(B2))\n        OB1 = T(B1) (Matches)\n        OB2 = T(B2) (Matches)\n        Construct OB3 = [ T(B1) row 1, T(B2) row 1, T(B1) row 3 ]\n        T(B1) row 1 = `020`\n        T(B2) row 1 = `020`\n        T(B1) row 3 = `020`\n        Constructed OB3:\n        ```\n        020\n        020\n        020\n        ```\n        Actual Example 3 OB3:\n        ```\n        020\n        220\n        020\n        ```\n        Mismatch! The constructed OB3 middle row is `020`, but the actual OB3 middle row is `220`.\n\n        My hypothesis [ T(B1) row 1, T(B2) row 1, T(B1) row 3 ] is incorrect.\n\n        Let's reconsider the simple hypothesis: Output = T(B1) + T(B2) + T(B1).\n        Example 1: Fails (OB3 mismatch)\n        Example 2: Works\n        Example 3: Works\n\n        This suggests either Example 1 is an outlier/error, or the rule depends on the content of B1 and B2.\n\n        What is special about Example 1?\n        B1: `[[0,1,0], [1,1,0], [0,1,0]]`\n        B2: `[[0,1,1], [0,1,0], [1,1,0]]`\n        B1 != B2\n\n        What about Example 2?\n        B1: `[[0,1,0], [1,0,1], [0,1,0]]`\n        B2: `[[1,0,1], [0,1,0], [1,0,1]]`\n        B1 != B2. The simple rule worked here. Why?\n        T(B1): `[[0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]]`\n        T(B2): `[[2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,2]]`\n        Output = T(B1) + T(B2) + T(B1)\n        ```\n        020\n        202\n        020\n        ---\n        202\n        020\n        202\n        ---\n        020\n        202\n        020\n        ```\n        This matches Example 2 Output exactly.\n\n        What about Example 3?\n        B1: `[[0,1,0], [1,1,0], [0,1,0]]`\n        B2: `[[0,1,0], [1,1,0], [0,1,0]]`\n        B1 == B2. The simple rule worked here.\n        T(B1) = T(B2): `[[0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]]`\n        Output = T(B1) + T(B2) + T(B1) = T(B1) + T(B1) + T(B1)\n        ```\n        020\n        220\n        020\n        ---\n        020\n        220\n        020\n        ---\n        020\n        220\n        020\n        ```\n        This matches Example 3 Output exactly.\n\n        So, the rule Output = T(B1) + T(B2) + T(B1) works for Examples 2 and 3, but *not* for Example 1 as presented in the prompt.\n\n        Let's assume the rule *is* Output = T(B1) + T(B2) + T(B1) and that Example 1's output in the prompt might have a typo. If this rule was applied to Example 1:\n        T(B1): `[[0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]]`\n        T(B2): `[[0,2,2], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]]`\n        Predicted Output = T(B1) + T(B2) + T(B1)\n        ```\n        020\n        220\n        020\n        ---\n        022\n        020\n        220\n        ---\n        020\n        220  <- Differs from prompt's Ex1 Output (row 8 is 022)\n        020\n        ```\n        Given that the rule T(B1)+T(B2)+T(B1) works perfectly for two out of three examples, it's the most likely candidate. The discrepancy in Example 1 might be an error in the problem description. I will proceed with the rule: Output = T(B1) + T(B2) + T(B1).\n\n4.  **Define the Final Rule:**\n    1.  Divide the 6x3 input grid into two 3x3 blocks: B1 (rows 1-3) and B2 (rows 4-6).\n    2.  Define transformation T: Change color 1 to color 2.\n    3.  Calculate T(B1) and T(B2).\n    4.  Construct the 9x3 output grid by vertically stacking T(B1), T(B2), and T(B1).\n\n5.  **Apply the Rule to the Test Input:**\n    *   Test Input:\n        ```\n        111\n        010\n        010\n        ---\n        111\n        010\n        010\n        ```\n    *   Identify Blocks:\n        *   B1: `[[1,1,1], [0,1,0], [0,1,0]]`\n        *   B2: `[[1,1,1], [0,1,0], [0,1,0]]`\n        *   Note: B1 = B2.\n    *   Apply Transformation T (1 -> 2):\n        *   T(B1): `[[2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0]]`\n        *   T(B2): `[[2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0]]`\n    *   Construct Output = T(B1) + T(B2) + T(B1):\n        ```\n        222  (T(B1) R1)\n        020  (T(B1) R2)\n        020  (T(B1) R3)\n        ---\n        222  (T(B2) R1)\n        020  (T(B2) R2)\n        020  (T(B2) R3)\n        ---\n        222  (T(B1) R1)\n        020  (T(B1) R2)\n        020  (T(B1) R3)\n        ```\n    *   Final Output Grid:\n        ```\n        222\n        020\n        020\n        222\n        020\n        020\n        222\n        020\n        020\n        ```\n\n6.  **Format the Output:** Convert the final grid to the required JSON format.\n    ```json\n    [[2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0]]\n    ```\n7.  **Final Sanity Check:** The rule identified (split 6x3 into two 3x3, transform 1->2, stack T(B1), T(B2), T(B1)) works consistently for Examples 2 and 3. It produces a plausible output for Example 1, differing only slightly from the provided output (which might be erroneous). Applying this rule to the test case yields a 9x3 grid with colors 0 and 2, consistent with the pattern. The test input having B1=B2 is similar to Example 3, where the rule worked perfectly. Therefore, the derived output seems correct based on the most consistent interpretation of the examples.\n```\n\n```<thinking>\n1.  **Analyze Input/Output Dimensions:** All examples have a 6x3 input and a 9x3 output. The test input is 6x3. The output should be 9x3.\n2.  **Analyze Color Transformation:** Input grids use colors 0 and 1. Output grids use colors 0 and 2. This strongly suggests a color mapping where 1 becomes 2, and 0 remains 0. Let's call this transformation T.\n3.  **Analyze Structural Transformation:** The output grid has 3 more rows than the input. Since 9 = 6 + 3, and the grids seem composed of 3x3 blocks, let's divide the 6x3 input into two 3x3 blocks: B1 (rows 1-3) and B2 (rows 4-6).\n4.  **Formulate Hypothesis:** Apply transformation T to B1 and B2 to get T(B1) and T(B2). The 9x3 output could be formed by stacking these transformed blocks. A likely pattern is stacking T(B1), T(B2), and then repeating one of them. Let's hypothesize the output is T(B1) stacked above T(B2) stacked above T(B1).\n5.  **Verify Hypothesis with Examples:**\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   B1: `[[0,1,0], [1,1,0], [0,1,0]]` -> T(B1): `[[0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]]`\n        *   B2: `[[0,1,1], [0,1,0], [1,1,0]]` -> T(B2): `[[0,2,2], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]]`\n        *   Predicted Output (T(B1)+T(B2)+T(B1)): `[[0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]]`\n        *   Provided Output: `[[0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]]`\n        *   There is a mismatch in row 8 (`[2,2,0]` vs `[0,2,2]`).\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   B1: `[[0,1,0], [1,0,1], [0,1,0]]` -> T(B1): `[[0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]]`\n        *   B2: `[[1,0,1], [0,1,0], [1,0,1]]` -> T(B2): `[[2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,2]]`\n        *   Predicted Output (T(B1)+T(B2)+T(B1)): `[[0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]]`\n        *   Provided Output: Matches the prediction exactly.\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   B1: `[[0,1,0], [1,1,0], [0,1,0]]` -> T(B1): `[[0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]]`\n        *   B2: `[[0,1,0], [1,1,0], [0,1,0]]` -> T(B2): `[[0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]]` (B1=B2, T(B1)=T(B2))\n        *   Predicted Output (T(B1)+T(B2)+T(B1)): `[[0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0]]`\n        *   Provided Output: Matches the prediction exactly.\n6.  **Refine Hypothesis:** The rule T(B1)+T(B2)+T(B1) works perfectly for Examples 2 and 3. The discrepancy in Example 1 might be an error in the provided example output. Given the consistency in the other two examples, this rule is the most probable.\n7.  **Apply Rule to Test Input:**\n    *   Test Input: `[[1,1,1], [0,1,0], [0,1,0], [1,1,1], [0,1,0], [0,1,0]]`\n    *   B1: `[[1,1,1], [0,1,0], [0,1,0]]`\n    *   B2: `[[1,1,1], [0,1,0], [0,1,0]]` (B1 = B2)\n    *   T(B1): `[[2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0]]`\n    *   T(B2): `[[2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0]]`\n    *   Output = T(B1) + T(B2) + T(B1)\n    *   Output Grid:\n        ```\n        222\n        020\n        020\n        222\n        020\n        020\n        222\n        020\n        020\n        ```\n8.  **Format Output:** Convert the grid to JSON format.\n```\n[[2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0]]\n```\n</thinking>```\n\n```<answer>\n[[2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 493, "completion_tokens": 10185, "model_answer": [[2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0]], "correct": true, "total_tokens": 10678}

Here, (2, 2) is in the top half (color 6), and (7, 7) is in the bottom half (color 7).\n\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Input: Color 1 at (2, 6), Color 4 at (7, 5).\n        *   Output: Follows the same pattern structure as Example 1.\n        *   Top Pattern (Color C1=1): (2, 6) is in the top half.\n            *   Row 0: Full 1\n            *   Row 1: 1 at ends, 0 inside\n            *   Row 2: Full 1\n            *   Row 3: 1 at ends, 0 inside\n            *   Row 4: 1 at ends, 0 inside\n        *   Bottom Pattern (Color C2=4): (7, 5) is in the bottom half.\n            *   Row 5: 4 at ends, 0 inside\n            *   Row 6: 4 at ends, 0 inside\n            *   Row 7: Full 4\n            *   Row 8: 4 at ends, 0 inside\n            *   Row 9: Full 4\n        *   Observation: This confirms the rule. The location of the non-black cells determines which color is used for the top pattern (rows 0-4) and which for the bottom pattern (rows 5-9). The exact coordinates within the halves (e.g., (2, 2) vs (2, 6)) don't seem to affect the output pattern itself, only the color used.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Find the two non-black cells in the 10x10 input grid.\n    *   Identify the color (C1) and position of the cell whose row index is between 0 and 4 (inclusive).\n    *   Identify the color (C2) and position of the cell whose row index is between 5 and 9 (inclusive).\n    *   Generate a 10x10 output grid.\n    *   Fill rows 0-4 according to the \"Top Pattern\" using color C1:\n        *   Row 0: All C1\n        *   Row 1: C1, eight 0s, C1\n        *   Row 2: All C1\n        *   Row 3: C1, eight 0s, C1\n        *   Row 4: C1, eight 0s, C1\n    *   Fill rows 5-9 according to the \"Bottom Pattern\" using color C2:\n        *   Row 5: C2, eight 0s, C2\n        *   Row 6: C2, eight 0s, C2\n        *   Row 7: All C2\n        *   Row 8: C2, eight 0s, C2\n        *   Row 9: All C2\n\n3.  **Apply the Rule to the Test Input:**\n    *   Test Input Grid:\n        ```\n        0000000000\n        0000000000\n        0000200000\n        0000000000\n        0000000000\n        0000000000\n        0000000000\n        0000008000\n        0000000000\n        0000000000\n        ```\n    *   Non-black cells: Color 2 at (2, 4) and Color 8 at (7, 6).\n    *   Cell (2, 4) is in the top half (row 2 is between 0 and 4). So, C1 = 2.\n    *   Cell (7, 6) is in the bottom half (row 7 is between 5 and 9). So, C2 = 8.\n    *   Construct the output grid:\n        *   Row 0: All 2s -> 2222222222\n        *   Row 1: 2, eight 0s, 2 -> 2000000002\n        *   Row 2: All 2s -> 2222222222\n        *   Row 3: 2, eight 0s, 2 -> 2000000002\n        *   Row 4: 2, eight 0s, 2 -> 2000000002\n        *   Row 5: 8, eight 0s, 8 -> 8000000008\n        *   Row 6: 8, eight 0s, 8 -> 8000000008\n        *   Row 7: All 8s -> 8888888888\n        *   Row 8: 8, eight 0s, 8 -> 8000000008\n        *   Row 9: All 8s -> 8888888888\n\n4.  **Final Output Grid Construction:** Combine the rows calculated above.\n    ```\n    [[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n     [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n     [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n     [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n     [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2],\n     [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n     [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n     [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n     [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n     [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]]\n    ```\n5.  **Final Check:** The output grid size is 10x10.

The output fills the horizontal space between these pairs with '3's. For instance, row 1 has '3' at columns 1 and 8; the output fills columns 2 through 7 with '3'. Row 4 has adjacent '3's at columns 4 and 5; no filling occurs.\n    *   Examine Example 2: This example involves two colors, '1' and '4'. The same filling rule applies independently for each color on each row. Row 2 has '1' at columns 0 and 5; columns 1-4 are filled with '1'. Row 6 has '4' at columns 4 and 9; columns 5-8 are filled with '4'.\n    *   Examine Example 3: Similar to Example 2, with colors '6' and '8'. The rule holds.

Cells that are initially non-zero retain their color unless they fall within the fill range of another color (which doesn't happen in the examples, but the rule implies the fill color overwrites). However, the examples suggest the fill only happens for the specific color being considered, filling only the 0s between its endpoints. Let's refine: For a color C, fill the cells between its leftmost and rightmost occurrence *with C*. This naturally handles overwriting 0s and potentially other colors if they happen to be in the path, though the examples only show filling 0s. The most consistent interpretation is filling the horizontal segment defined by the endpoints of a color *with that color*.\n\n3.  **Apply the Rule to the Test Input:**\n    *   Input Grid:\n        ```\n        0000000000\n        4004000000\n        0440700007\n        0440070070\n        0000007700\n        0000007700\n        0300003000\n        0030030000\n        0003300000\n        0003300000\n        ```\n    *   Process row by row:\n        *   Row 0: `0000000000` -> No change -> `0000000000`\n        *   Row 1: `4004000000`.

Input has 5 red cells. Shape is 'X'.\n    *   Ex 2: Input `[[2,0,0],[2,0,0],[0,2,0]]` -> Output `[[7]]`. Input has 3 red cells. Shape is like 'L' or '7'.\n    *   Ex 3: Input `[[2,0,2],[2,0,2],[2,0,2]]` -> Output `[[1]]`. Input has 6 red cells. Shape is two vertical lines.\n    *   Ex 4: Input `[[0,0,0],[2,0,2],[0,0,0]]` -> Output `[[1]]`. Input has 2 red cells. Shape is two dots.\n    *   Ex 5: Input `[[2,2,0],[0,2,2],[0,0,0]]` -> Output `[[7]]`. Input has 4 red cells. Diagonal shape.\n    *   Ex 6: Input `[[2,2,0],[0,2,0],[0,0,0]]` -> Output `[[7]]`. Input has 3 red cells. Shape is like '7'.\n\n3.  **Formulate Hypotheses:**\n    *   **Hypothesis 1: Count of red cells.** The counts (5, 3, 6, 2, 4, 3) map to (1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 7). This mapping is not straightforward (e.g., 3 maps to 7, but 2 maps to 1). Rule discarded.\n    *   **Hypothesis 2: Shape Recognition.** The outputs 1 and 7 might correspond to whether the input shape resembles a '1' or a '7'. This is subjective and hard to define precisely.\n    *   **Hypothesis 3: Connectivity.** Analyzing the number of orthogonally connected components of red cells gives counts (5, 3, 6, 2, 2, 1) mapping to (1, 7, 1, 1, 7, 7). This is also inconsistent (2 maps to both 1 and 7). Rule discarded.\n    *   **Hypothesis 4: Symmetry.** Let's check for different types of symmetry in the input grids.\n        *   Types: Horizontal (H), Vertical (V), Point (P, 180\u00b0 rotation), Main Diagonal (\\, D1), Anti-Diagonal (/, D2).\n        *   Ex 1: `[[2,0,2],[0,2,0],[2,0,2]]` - H, V, P, D1, D2 symmetry. Output: 1.\n        *   Ex 2: `[[2,0,0],[2,0,0],[0,2,0]]` - No symmetry. Output: 7.\n        *   Ex 3: `[[2,0,2],[2,0,2],[2,0,2]]` - H, V, P symmetry. Output: 1.\n        *   Ex 4: `[[0,0,0],[2,0,2],[0,0,0]]` - H, V, P symmetry. Output: 1.\n        *   Ex 5: `[[2,2,0],[0,2,2],[0,0,0]]` - No symmetry. Output: 7.\n        *   Ex 6: `[[2,2,0],[0,2,0],[0,0,0]]` - No symmetry. Output: 7.\n\n    *   **Refined Hypothesis 4:** If the input grid has *any* of the five symmetries (H, V, P, D1, D2), the output is 1. Otherwise, the output is 7. This hypothesis holds true for all 6 examples.\n\n4.  **Define Symmetry Checks for 3x3 Grid G:**\n    *   Horizontal: `G[0][j] == G[2][j]` for j=0,1,2.\n    *   Vertical: `G[i][0] == G[i][2]` for i=0,1,2.\n    *   Point: `G[i][j] == G[2-i][2-j]` for all i,j. (Equivalent to checking `G[0][0]==G[2][2]`, `G[0][1]==G[2][1]`, `G[0][2]==G[2][0]`, `G[1][0]==G[1][2]`).\n    *   Main Diagonal (\\): `G[i][j] == G[j][i]` for all i,j. (Equivalent to checking `G[0][1]==G[1][0]`, `G[0][2]==G[2][0]`, `G[1][2]==G[2][1]`).\n    *   Anti-Diagonal (/): `G[i][j] == G[2-j][2-i]` for all i,j. (Equivalent to checking `G[0][0]==G[2][2]`, `G[0][1]==G[1][2]`, `G[1][0]==G[2][1]`).\n\n5.  **Apply the Rule to the Test Input:**\n    Test Input Grid `G`:\n    ```\n    2 0 2\n    2 2 2\n    2 0 2\n    ```\n    *   Check Horizontal Symmetry:\n        *   `G[0][0] == G[2][0]` -> `2 == 2` (True)\n        *   `G[0][1] == G[2][1]` -> `0 == 0` (True)\n        *   `G[0][2] == G[2][2]` -> `2 == 2` (True)\n        *   The grid has Horizontal Symmetry.\n\n    *   According to the rule, since at least one symmetry is present, the output should be 1.\n\n6.  **Format the Output:**\n    The output should be a 1x1 grid containing the digit 1, formatted as a JSON list of lists.\n    Output: `[[1]]`\n```</thinking>\n\n```<answer>\n[[1]]\n```", "prompt_tokens": 421, "completion_tokens": 5614, "model_answer": [[1]], "correct": true, "total_tokens": 6035}

Each input grid has a prominent horizontal line and a vertical line of the same color, dividing the grid. Let's call this the 'separator color'.\n    *   Example 1: Separator color is 2. Lines are at row index 5 and column index 5. Grid size 11x11. Output size 10x10.\n    *   Example 2: Separator color is 8. Lines are at row index 4 and column index 4. Grid size 9x9. Output size 8x8.\n    *   Example 3: Separator color is 4. Lines are at row index 3 and column index 3. Grid size 7x7. Output size 6x6.\n    *   The separator lines seem to divide the input grid into four quadrants (excluding the lines themselves).\n    *   The content (non-black, non-separator color) appears only in the top-left quadrant in all examples.\n    *   The output grids are smaller, specifically by one row and one column, corresponding to the removal of the separator lines.\n    *   The output grid seems to be constructed based on the content of the top-left quadrant of the input grid.\n    *   The color of the pattern in the output grid matches the separator color from the input grid.\n    *   The pattern in the output grid appears to be a four-way reflection (like a kaleidoscope) of the pattern from the input's top-left quadrant, after changing its color.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Transformation Rule:**\n    *   Step 1: Identify the separator color and the location of the horizontal and vertical separator lines in the input grid. These lines divide the grid.\n    *   Step 2: Extract the top-left quadrant of the input grid (the part above the horizontal line and to the left of the vertical line).\n    *   Step 3: Create a transformed version of this top-left quadrant: replace all non-black colors within this quadrant with the separator color identified in Step 1. Keep black (0) as black.\n    *   Step 4: Construct the output grid. The output grid's dimensions will be twice the dimensions of the extracted quadrant.\n    *   Step 5: Fill the output grid:\n        *   Place the transformed quadrant in the top-left section of the output grid.\n        *   Generate the top-right section by reflecting the transformed quadrant horizontally.\n        *   Generate the bottom-left section by reflecting the transformed quadrant vertically.\n        *   Generate the bottom-right section by reflecting the transformed quadrant both horizontally and vertically (or reflecting the top-right vertically / bottom-left horizontally).\n\n3.  **Verify the Rule with Examples:**\n    *   Example 1: Separator 2. Top-left (5x5) has a shape of color 1. Transform 1->2. Reflect the 5x5 transformed shape to create a 10x10 output. Matches Example 1 Output.\n    *   Example 2: Separator 8. Top-left (4x4) has a shape of color 3. Transform 3->8. Reflect the 4x4 transformed shape to create an 8x8 output. Matches Example 2 Output.\n    *   Example 3: Separator 4. Top-left (3x3) has a shape of color 2. Transform 2->4. Reflect the 3x3 transformed shape to create a 6x6 output. Matches Example 3 Output.\n    *   The rule holds for all examples.\n\n4.  **Apply the Rule to the Test Input:**\n    *   Step 1: Input grid is 13x13. The horizontal line of color 3 is at row index 6. The vertical line of color 3 is at column index 6. Separator color is 3.\n    *   Step 2: Extract the top-left quadrant (rows 0-5, columns 0-5). Dimensions are 6x6.\n        ```\n        008000\n        080000\n        808000\n        008000\n        008800\n        000000\n        ```\n    *   Step 3: Transform the quadrant. Replace color 8 with the separator color 3.\n        ```\n        003000\n        030000\n        303000\n        003000\n        003300\n        000000\n        ```\n        Let's call this `Q_TL`.\n    *   Step 4: The output grid will be (6*2) x (6*2) = 12x12.\n    *   Step 5: Fill the output grid:\n        *   Top-Left (TL): `Q_TL`\n        *   Top-Right (TR): Horizontal reflection of `Q_TL`.\n            ```\n            000300\n            000030\n            000303\n            000300\n            003300\n            000000\n            ```\n        *   Bottom-Left (BL): Vertical reflection of `Q_TL`.\n            ```\n            000000\n            003300\n            003000\n            303000\n            030000\n            003000\n            ```\n        *   Bottom-Right (BR): Horizontal reflection of `BL` (or vertical of `TR`).\n            ```\n            000000\n            003300\n            000300\n            000303\n            000030\n            000300\n            ```\n        *   Combine TL, TR, BL, BR into the 12x12 grid.\n\n            ```\n            Row 0:  003000 | 000300\n            Row 1:  030000 | 000030\n            Row 2:  303000 | 000303\n            Row 3:  003000 | 000300\n            Row 4:  003300 | 003300\n            Row 5:  000000 | 000000\n            ---------------------\n            Row 6:  000000 | 000000\n            Row 7:  003300 | 003300\n            Row 8:  003000 | 000300\n            Row 9:  303000 | 000303\n            Row 10: 030000 | 000030\n            Row 11: 003000 | 000300\n            ```\n\n5.  **Format the Output:** Convert the final grid into the required JSON list of lists format.\n```json\n[[0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0],\n [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0],\n [3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3],\n [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0],\n [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [0,0,3,3,0,0,0,0,3,3,0,0],\n [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0],\n [3,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,3],\n [0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0],\n [0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]]\n```\nThis matches the grid derived in step 4.```<thinking>\n1.  **Analyze Input/Output Pairs:**\n    *   **Structure:** Each input grid has a distinct cross-like structure formed by a single horizontal row and a single vertical column filled with the same non-black color. This color acts as a separator.\n    *   **Separator Color & Location:**\n        *   Example 1: Color 2, Row 5, Col 5 (Indices). Grid 11x11.\n        *   Example 2: Color 8, Row 4, Col 4 (Indices). Grid 9x9.\n        *   Example 3: Color 4, Row 3, Col 3 (Indices). Grid 7x7.\n    *   **Content:** The actual patterns (using other colors) are located exclusively in the top-left quadrant defined by the separator lines. The other three quadrants are empty (filled with black/0).\n    *   **Output Structure:** The output grids are smaller than the inputs. The size difference corresponds exactly to the removal of the separator row and column.\n        *   Example 1: 11x11 -> 10x10 (remove 1 row, 1 col).\n        *   Example 2: 9x9 -> 8x8.\n        *   Example 3: 7x7 -> 6x6.\n    *   **Output Content:** The output grid contains a pattern that seems derived from the input's top-left quadrant. The color of the pattern in the output is the *separator color* from the input. The pattern fills the entire output grid, exhibiting symmetry. It looks like the top-left quadrant's pattern (after color change) is reflected horizontally to form the top-right, vertically for the bottom-left, and both ways for the bottom-right.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Transformation Rule:**\n    *   1.  **Identify Separators:** Find the unique row index `R` and column index `C` where the row `R` and column `C` are filled entirely with a single non-black color. This color is the `SeparatorColor`.\n    *   2.  **Extract Top-Left Quadrant:** Get the subgrid from `(0, 0)` to `(R-1, C-1)`. Let its dimensions be `H x W` (where `H=R`, `W=C`).\n    *   3.  **Transform Quadrant:** Create a new `H x W` grid. For each cell `(r, c)` in the extracted quadrant: if the input cell `(r, c)` is black (0), the output cell `(r, c)` is black (0). Otherwise, the output cell `(r, c)` takes the `SeparatorColor`.\n    *   4.  **Construct Output Grid:** Create a new grid of size `(2*H) x (2*W)`.\n    *   5.  **Populate Output Grid using Reflections:**\n        *   Copy the transformed quadrant into the top-left `H x W` section of the output grid.\n        *   Fill the top-right `H x W` section by horizontally reflecting the top-left section.\n        *   Fill the bottom-left `H x W` section by vertically reflecting the top-left section.\n        *   Fill the bottom-right `H x W` section by reflecting the top-left section both horizontally and vertically (or reflecting the top-right vertically, or the bottom-left horizontally).\n\n3.  **Apply Rule to Test Input:**\n    *   **Input Grid:** 13x13.\n    *   **1.

Sort the colors `c` based on `avg_col(c)` in ascending order. The output grid is 1xN.\n    *   If `range_row >= range_col`, the arrangement is considered vertical.

In all examples, the output grid is identical to the input grid except for the last row, where some cells are changed to color 4 (blue).\n\n2.  **Identify the Pattern/Shapes:**\n    *   Look for recurring patterns or shapes in the input grids that seem to trigger the changes in the output.\n    *   In Example 1, there are two shapes made of color 6. Each shape consists of 5 pixels: a 3-pixel horizontal line and two pixels below the ends of the line.\n        *   Shape 1: (0,1),(0,2),(0,3) and (1,1),(1,3).\n        *   Shape 2: (2,4),(2,5),(2,6) and (3,4),(3,6).\n    *   In Example 2, there is one such shape made of color 3: (0,1),(0,2),(0,3) and (1,1),(1,3).\n    *   In Example 3, there are two such shapes:\n        *   Shape 1 (Color 8): (1,1),(1,2),(1,3) and (2,1),(2,3).\n        *   Shape 2 (Color 6): (2,4),(2,5),(2,6) and (3,4),(3,6).\n    *   This specific 5-pixel shape seems to be the key element. Let's define it relative to its top-left corner (r, c): {(r, c), (r, c+1), (r, c+2), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+2)}.\n\n3.  **Relate Shapes to Output Changes:**\n    *   The output involves placing color 4 in the last row of the grid. We need to determine the column positions for these '4's based on the identified shapes.\n    *   Let's examine the column position of the '4' relative to the shape's properties. A noticeable feature of the shape is the \"gap\" in the second row, located at column `c+1`. Let's call this the `gap_col`.\n    *   **Example 1:**\n        *   Shape 1 (Color 6): r=0, c=1. `gap_col` = 1+1 = 2. Output '4' is at col 3.\n        *   Shape 2 (Color 6): r=2, c=4. `gap_col` = 4+1 = 5. Output '4' is at col 7.\n    *   **Example 2:**\n        *   Shape 1 (Color 3): r=0, c=1. `gap_col` = 1+1 = 2. Output '4' is at col 2.\n    *   **Example 3:**\n        *   Shape 1 (Color 8): r=1, c=1. `gap_col` = 1+1 = 2. Output '4' is at col 2.\n        *   Shape 2 (Color 6): r=2, c=4. `gap_col` = 4+1 = 5. Output '4' is at col 5.\n\n4.  **Formulate and Refine the Hypothesis:**\n    *   Hypothesis 1: Place a '4' in the last row at the `gap_col` for each identified shape.\n    *   Testing Hypothesis 1:\n        *   Ex 1: Fails (Output cols 3, 7 vs. Gap cols 2, 5).\n        *   Ex 2: Works (Output col 2 vs. Gap col 2).\n        *   Ex 3: Works (Output cols 2, 5 vs. Gap cols 2, 5).\n    *   Hypothesis 1 works for Ex 2 and Ex 3 but not Ex 1. Why the discrepancy?\n        *   Possibility 1: Example 1 output is incorrect or has a typo. If the output was `... 00400400` instead of `... 00400040`, the rule would hold.\n        *   Possibility 2: There's a condition specific to Example 1 (e.g., grid size 8x8, or two shapes of the *same* color 6) that modifies the rule (e.g., adds an offset: +1 for the first shape, +2 for the second?). This seems overly complex and less likely than a consistent simple rule.\n    *   Given that the simple rule (Output col = `gap_col`) works for two diverse examples (different sizes, colors, number of shapes), it's the most probable intended rule. We will proceed assuming this rule is correct and Example 1 might be an outlier or contain an error.\n\n5.  **Final Rule:**\n    1.  Identify all non-overlapping 5-pixel shapes matching the pattern: {(r, c), (r, c+1), (r, c+2), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+2)}, where the 5 pixels share the same non-black color.\n    2.  For each shape found starting at (r, c), determine its `gap_col = c+1`.\n    3.  Copy the input grid to the output grid.\n    4.  In the last row of the output grid (row index `height - 1`), set the cell at column `gap_col` to color 4.\n\n6.  **Apply the Rule to the Test Input:**\n    *   **Test Input Grid:**\n        ```\n        05550000000\n        05050888000\n        00000808333\n        00000000303\n        00000000000\n        00000000000\n        00000000000\n        ```\n    *   Grid dimensions: Height = 7, Width = 11. Last row index = 6.\n    *   **Identify Shapes:**\n        *   Shape 1 (Color 5): Starts at r=0, c=1. `gap_col` = 1+1 = 2.\n        *   Shape 2 (Color 8): Starts at r=1, c=5. `gap_col` = 5+1 = 6.\n        *   Shape 3 (Color 3): Starts at r=2, c=8. `gap_col` = 8+1 = 9.\n    *   **Construct Output Grid:**\n        *   Copy the input grid.\n        *   Modify the last row (row 6). The initial last row is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n        *   Place '4' at index 2: `[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n        *   Place '4' at index 6: `[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]`\n        *   Place '4' at index 9: `[0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]`\n    *   **Final Output Grid:**\n        ```\n        05550000000\n        05050888000\n        00000808333\n        00000000303\n        00000000000\n        00000000000\n        00400040040\n        ```\n\n7.  **Format the Output:** Present the final grid as a JSON list of lists.\n```\n\n```<answer>\n[\n  [0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]\n]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 655, "completion_tokens": 2140, "model_answer": [[0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0]], "correct": true, "total_tokens": 2795}

The output fills a rectangle with color 1. The top-left corner of this rectangle is (1, 1) (min row of '1's, min col of '1's) and the bottom-right corner is (3, 6) (max row of '1's, max col of '1's). Similarly, color 2 is at (5, 3) and (7, 7). The output fills a rectangle with color 2 from (5, 3) to (7, 7).\n    *   Look at Example 2: Input has color 3 at (1, 1) and (4, 2). Output fills rectangle [1:4, 1:2] with 3. Input has color 7 at (3, 7) and (4, 4). Output fills rectangle [3:4, 4:7] with 7.\n    *   Look at Example 3: Input has color 4 at (2, 1) and (6, 5). Output fills rectangle [2:6, 1:5] with 4.\n    *   Look at Example 4: Input has color 7 at (1, 1) and (3, 7). Output fills rectangle [1:3, 1:7] with 7.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Rule:** The transformation rule is as follows:\n    *   For each distinct non-zero color `C` found in the input grid:\n        *   Find all cells (r, c) containing color `C`.\n        *   Determine the minimum row (`min_r`), maximum row (`max_r`), minimum column (`min_c`), and maximum column (`max_c`) among these cells.\n        *   This defines a bounding box for color `C`.\n    *   Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input, initially filled with 0s.\n    *   For each color `C` and its calculated bounding box (`min_r`, `max_r`, `min_c`, `max_c`), fill all cells (r, c) in the output grid such that `min_r <= r <= max_r` and `min_c <= c <= max_c` with the color `C`.\n    *   If bounding boxes for different colors overlap, the cells in the overlapping region will be filled by the color processed last. However, since the examples show distinct colors filling their respective boxes without explicit rules for overlap precedence (and the process fills onto a zero grid), we can assume the final grid is a simple superposition of all filled bounding boxes.\n\n4.  **Apply the Rule to the Test Input:**\n    *   Test Input Grid (9 rows, 8 columns):\n        ```\n        80000000\n        00800000\n        00000000\n        00000000\n        00000600\n        00000000\n        00000000\n        06000000\n        00000000\n        ```\n    *   Identify colors and their locations:\n        *   Color 8: (0, 0), (1, 2)\n        *   Color 6: (4, 5), (7, 1)\n    *   Calculate bounding boxes:\n        *   Color 8: `min_r`=0, `max_r`=1, `min_c`=0, `max_c`=2. Box is rows 0-1, columns 0-2.\n        *   Color 6: `min_r`=4, `max_r`=7, `min_c`=1, `max_c`=5. Box is rows 4-7, columns 1-5.\n    *   Create the 9x8 output grid (initially all 0s).\n    *   Fill the bounding box for color 8: Cells from (0,0) to (1,2) become 8.\n        ```\n        88800000\n        88800000\n        00000000\n        00000000\n        00000000\n        00000000\n        00000000\n        00000000\n        00000000\n        ```\n    *   Fill the bounding box for color 6: Cells from (4,1) to (7,5) become 6.\n        ```\n        88800000\n        88800000\n        00000000\n        00000000\n        06666600  // Row 4\n        06666600  // Row 5\n        06666600  // Row 6\n        06666600  // Row 7\n        00000000\n        ```\n    *   This is the final grid.\n\n5.  **Format the Output:** Convert the final grid to the specified JSON format.\n```json\n[[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n```</thinking>```<answer>\n```json\n[[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\n```\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 1090, "completion_tokens": 3584, "model_answer": [[8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "correct": true, "total_tokens": 4674}

These changes seem localized to 3x3 regions.\n\n2.  **Examine Example 1:**\n    *   Input 1:\n        ```\n        111...\n        101...\n        111...\n        ...\n        ...111...\n        ...010...\n        ...111...\n        ```\n    *   Output 1:\n        ```\n        020...\n        222...\n        020...\n        ...\n        ...020...\n        ...222...\n        ...020...\n        ```\n    *   Two distinct 3x3 areas are transformed into the same output pattern: a plus sign ('+') made of color 2, with the corners becoming color 0.\n        ```\n        020\n        222\n        020\n        ```\n    *   Let's analyze the input 3x3 patterns that trigger this transformation.\n        *   Trigger 1 (centered at 1,1): Input is `[[1,1,1], [1,0,1], [1,1,1]]`. A 3x3 square of 1s with a 0 in the center.\n        *   Trigger 2 (centered at 7,5): Input is `[[1,1,1], [0,1,0], [1,1,1]]`. A center 1, horizontal neighbors 0, vertical and diagonal neighbors 1.\n\n3.  **Examine Example 2:**\n    *   Input 2:\n        ```\n        ...111...\n        ...101...\n        ...111...\n        ...\n        .111...\n        .101...\n        .111...\n        ```\n    *   Output 2:\n        ```\n        ...020...\n        ...222...\n        ...020...\n        ...\n        .020...\n        .222...\n        .020...\n        ```\n    *   Again, two 3x3 areas are transformed into the same `020 / 222 / 020` pattern.\n    *   Analyze the input triggers:\n        *   Trigger 1 (centered at 1,6): Input is `[[1,1,1], [0,1,0], [1,1,1]]`.

Same as Trigger 2 in Example 1.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Rule:**\n    *   There are two distinct 3x3 input patterns that trigger the transformation.\n    *   **Pattern A (Hollow Square):** A 3x3 area where the center is 0 and all 8 neighbors are 1.\n        ```\n        111\n        101\n        111\n        ```\n    *   **Pattern B (Vertical Bars / Rotated H):** A 3x3 area where the center is 1, the horizontal neighbors (left/right) are 0, and the other 6 neighbors (top/bottom/diagonals) are 1.\n        ```\n        111\n        010\n        111\n        ```\n    *   **Transformation:** When either Pattern A or Pattern B is detected in a 3x3 window centered at (r, c) in the input grid:\n        *   The corresponding 3x3 window in the output grid is replaced with:\n            ```\n            020\n            222\n            020\n            ```\n        *   Specifically:\n            Output(r, c) = 2\n            Output(r-1, c) = 2, Output(r+1, c) = 2\n            Output(r, c-1) = 2, Output(r, c+1) = 2\n            Output(r-1, c-1) = 0, Output(r-1, c+1) = 0\n            Output(r+1, c-1) = 0, Output(r+1, c+1) = 0\n    *   **Application Strategy:** Find all occurrences of Pattern A and Pattern B in the input grid. Create the output grid by copying the input grid. Then, for each found pattern centered at (r, c), apply the transformation to the 3x3 area centered at (r, c) in the output grid. Overlapping transformations are not seen in examples, but this strategy handles overwriting if needed (last transformation applied wins for a given cell).\n\n5.  **Apply the Rule to the Test Input:**\n    *   Test Input Grid:\n        ```\n        0000000010\n        0000000111\n        0111000010\n        0101000000\n        0111000000\n        0000000000\n        0000001100\n        0111000000\n        0101000011\n        0111000011\n        ```\n    *   Initialize Output Grid as a copy of the Test Input.\n    *   Scan for patterns:\n        *   Check center (3, 1): Input window is `[[1,1,1], [1,0,1], [1,1,1]]`. This matches Pattern A.\n        *   Check center (8, 1): Input window is `[[1,1,1], [1,0,1], [1,1,1]]`. This matches Pattern A.\n        *   No other 3x3 windows match Pattern A or Pattern B.\n    *   Apply transformation for center (3, 1): Modify Output[2:5, 0:3] to `[[0,2,0], [2,2,2], [0,2,0]]`.\n        Intermediate Output Grid:\n        ```\n        0000000010\n        0000000111\n        0020000010  <- Changed\n        0222000000  <- Changed\n        0020000000  <- Changed\n        0000000000\n        0000001100\n        0111000000\n        0101000011\n        0111000011\n        ```\n    *   Apply transformation for center (8, 1): Modify Output[7:10, 0:3] to `[[0,2,0], [2,2,2], [0,2,0]]`.\n        Final Output Grid:\n        ```\n        0000000010\n        0000000111\n        0020000010\n        0222000000\n        0020000000\n        0000000000\n        0000001100\n        0020000000  <- Changed\n        0222000011  <- Changed\n        0020000011  <- Changed\n        ```\n\n6.  **Format the Output:** Convert the final grid to the required JSON format.\n```json\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]\n```\n```\n\n```json\n[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]]\n```", "prompt_tokens": 827, "completion_tokens": 14475, "model_answer": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]], "correct": true, "total_tokens": 15302}

They appear to be composed of 3x3 blocks, arranged in a 3x3 super-grid structure.\n\n2.  **Identify the Pattern/Rule:**\n    *   Let the input grid be `I` and the output grid be `O`. Let the size of `I` be `N x N` (here N=3). The output grid `O` is `(3N) x (3N)`.\n    *   Divide the output grid `O` into an `N x N` grid of blocks, where each block `Bij` is of size `N x N`.

There are three example pairs of input and output grids, and I need to apply the discovered rule to the test input grid.\n\nFirst, I observe the structure of the grids. The input grids in the examples have varying numbers of rows but seem to follow a pattern in terms of content. Let's convert the string representations into proper grid formats for clarity.\n\n**Example 1 Input:**\n- Row 1: [0, 1, 0]\n- Row 2: [1, 1, 0]\n- Row 3: [0, 1, 0]\n- Row 4: [0, 1, 1]\n- Row 5: [0, 1, 0]\n- Row 6: [1, 1, 0]\n\n**Example 1 Output:**\n- Row 1: [0, 2, 0]\n- Row 2: [2, 2, 0]\n- Row 3: [0, 2, 0]\n- Row 4: [0, 2, 2]\n- Row 5: [0, 2, 0]\n- Row 6: [2, 2, 0]\n- Row 7: [0, 2, 0]\n- Row 8: [0, 2, 2]\n- Row 9: [0, 2, 0]\n\nI notice that the output has more rows than the input. Specifically, it appears that for every row in the input, there might be a pattern of duplication or extension in the output. Counting the rows:\n- Input: 6 rows\n- Output: 9 rows\n\nThis suggests a possible pattern of adding rows based on some rule. Let's check the other examples.\n\n**Example 2 Input:**\n- Row 1: [0, 1, 0]\n- Row 2: [1, 0, 1]\n- Row 3: [0, 1, 0]\n- Row 4: [1, 0, 1]\n- Row 5: [0, 1, 0]\n- Row 6: [1, 0, 1]\n\n**Example 2 Output:**\n- Row 1: [0, 2, 0]\n- Row 2: [2, 0, 2]\n- Row 3: [0, 2, 0]\n- Row 4: [2, 0, 2]\n- Row 5: [0, 2, 0]\n- Row 6: [2, 0, 2]\n- Row 7: [0, 2, 0]\n- Row 8: [2, 0, 2]\n- Row 9: [0, 2, 0]\n\nAgain, input has 6 rows, output has 9 rows.\n\n**Example 3 Input:**\n- Row 1: [0, 1, 0]\n- Row 2: [1, 1, 0]\n- Row 3: [0, 1, 0]\n- Row 4: [0, 1, 0]\n- Row 5: [1, 1, 0]\n- Row 6: [0, 1, 0]\n\n**Example 3 Output:**\n- Row 1: [0, 2, 0]\n- Row 2: [2, 2, 0]\n- Row 3: [0, 2, 0]\n- Row 4: [0, 2, 0]\n- Row 5: [2, 2, 0]\n- Row 6: [0, 2, 0]\n- Row 7: [0, 2, 0]\n- Row 8: [2, 2, 0]\n- Row 9: [0, 2, 0]\n\nSame pattern: 6 input rows to 9 output rows.\n\nNow, looking at the content, I see that in all outputs, wherever there was a 1 in the input, it becomes a 2 in the output. The 0s remain 0s. This seems to be a consistent transformation of values.\n\nRegarding the row count, the output has 9 rows for 6 input rows. This could mean that the output is repeating the input pattern with some modification. Let's hypothesize that the output is the input grid repeated 1.5 times or something similar, but since grids must have integer rows, it might be a pattern of duplicating every second row or something like that.\n\nLet's align the input and output rows to see the pattern:\n\nFor Example 1:\n- Input Row 1: [0,1,0] -> Output Row 1: [0,2,0]\n- Input Row 2: [1,1,0] -> Output Row 2: [2,2,0]\n- Input Row 3: [0,1,0] -> Output Row 3: [0,2,0]\n- Input Row 4: [0,1,1] -> Output Row 4: [0,2,2]\n- Input Row 5: [0,1,0] -> Output Row 5: [0,2,0]\n- Input Row 6: [1,1,0] -> Output Row 6: [2,2,0]\n- (no input)       -> Output Row 7: [0,2,0]\n- (no input)       -> Output Row 8: [0,2,2]\n- (no input)       -> Output Row 9: [0,2,0]\n\nI notice that Output Row 7 is the same as Output Row 3 (which corresponds to Input Row 3), Output Row 8 is the same as Output Row 4, and Output Row 9 is the same as Output Row 5. This suggests that after the full input is transformed (rows 1-6), rows 3-5 of the output are repeated as rows 7-9.\n\nChecking Example 2:\n- Output Row 7: [0,2,0] matches Output Row 3\n- Output Row 8: [2,0,2] matches Output Row 4\n- Output Row 9: [0,2,0] matches Output Row 5\n\nSame pattern.\n\nChecking Example 3:\n- Output Row 7: [0,2,0] matches Output Row 4\n- Output Row 8: [2,2,0] matches Output Row 5\n- Output Row 9: [0,2,0] matches Output Row 6\n\nIn Example 3, it's rows 4-6 of the output that are repeated as rows 7-9.\n\nIn Example 1 and 2, output rows 3-5 are repeated as 7-9.\nIn Example 3, output rows 4-6 are repeated as 7-9.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests I need to rethink the pattern. Since all inputs have 6 rows and outputs have 9 rows, it might be a fixed structure. Perhaps it's always the last 3 rows of the input that are repeated in the output after the full grid.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Input rows 4-6 are [0,1,1], [0,1,0], [1,1,0]\n- Output rows 4-6 are [0,2,2], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]\n- Output rows 7-9 are [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0] which do not match.\n\nThat's not correct. Let's try input rows 3-5:\n- Input rows 3-5: [0,1,0], [0,1,1], [0,1,0]\n- Output rows 3-5: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0]\n- Output rows 7-9: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0] which matches.\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Input rows 3-5: [0,1,0], [1,0,1], [0,1,0]\n- Output rows 3-5: [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0]\n- Output rows 7-9: [0,2,0], [2,0,2], [0,2,0] which matches.\n\nIn Example 3:\n- Input rows 3-5: [0,1,0], [0,1,0], [1,1,0]\n- Output rows 3-5: [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]\n- Output rows 7-9: [0,2,0], [2,2,0], [0,2,0] which does not match.\n\nIn Example 3, output row 7 matches output row 4, row 8 matches row 5, row 9 matches row 6.\n\nSo the pattern is: output rows 1-6 correspond to input rows 1-6 with 1s turned to 2s, and output rows 7-9 correspond to output rows 4-6 (i.e., input rows 4-6 transformed).\n\nConfirming:\nIn Example 1:\n- Output rows 4-6: [0,2,2], [0,2,0], [2,2,0]\n- Output rows 7-9: [0,2,0], [0,2,2], [0,2,0] which does not match.\n\nI misread earlier. Let's correct:\nIn Example 1 output:\n- Row 7: [0,2,0] matches row 3, not row 4.\nI think I have a typo in my earlier transcription. Let me double-check the problem statement.\n\nLooking at Example 1 Output again:\n\"020\n220\n020\n022\n020\n220\n020\n022\n020\"\n\nSo:\n- Row 1: 020\n- Row 2: 220\n- Row 3: 020\n- Row 4: 022\n- Row 5: 020\n- Row 6: 220\n- Row 7: 020\n- Row 8: 022\n- Row 9: 020\n\nSo output rows 7-9 are 020,022,020 which match output rows 3-5: 020,022,020.\n\nI apologize for the confusion. Correcting:\nIn all examples, output rows 7-9 match output rows 3-5.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Rows 3-5: 020,022,020\n- Rows 7-9: 020,022,020\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Rows 3-5: 020,202,020\n- Rows 7-9: 020,202,020\n\nIn Example 3:\n- Rows 3-5: 020,020,220\n- Rows 7-9: 020,220,020 which does NOT match.\n\nIn Example 3 output:\n\"020\n220\n020\n020\n220\n020\n020\n220\n020\"\n\nSo:\n- Row 3: 020\n- Row 4: 020\n- Row 5: 220\n- Row 7: 020\n- Row 8: 220\n- Row 9: 020\n\nSo rows 7-9 are 020,220,020 which match rows 5,3,5 or something. I'm getting confused.\n\nI am considering that the output is always 9 rows, and the input is mapped to rows 1-6, and rows 7-9 are a repetition of rows 1-3 or something.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Rows 1-3: 020,220,020\n- Rows 7-9: 020,022,020 not matching.\n\nI think the simplest rule is:\n- Output rows 1 to n match input rows 1 to n with 1s turned to 2s, where n is the number of input rows (6 in all examples).\n- Output rows n+1 to n+3 (7 to 9) are a repetition of output rows 3 to 5.\n\nIn Example 3:\n- Output rows 3-5: 020,020,220\n- Output rows 7-9: 020,220,020 which is rows 3,5,3 or something.\n\nI am considering that since all inputs are 6 rows, output is always 9 rows, with rows 1-6 as transformed input, and rows 7-9 as repetition of rows 1-3 transformed.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Rows 1-3: 020,220,020\n- Rows 7-9: 020,022,020 not matching.\n\nI am considering that it's rows 4-6 repeated:\nIn Example 1:\n- Rows 4-6: 022,020,220\n- Rows 7-9: 020,022,020 not matching.\n\nI need to accept that in all examples, input is 6 rows, output is 9 rows, and deduce the repetition.\n\nSince it's consistent across examples that output rows 7-9 are output rows 3-5 in Examples 1 and 2, but slightly off in Example 3, perhaps it's a typo or I misread.\n\nLooking at Example 3 output again:\n\"020\n220\n020\n020\n220\n020\n020\n220\n020\"\n\nSo rows:\n1:020\n2:220\n3:020\n4:020\n5:220\n6:020\n7:020\n8:220\n9:020\n\nSo rows 7-9: 020,220,020 which is rows 1,2,1 or rows 3,5,3 etc.\n\nI think the consistent rule is hard to find, but since test input also has 6 rows, I will assume output has 9 rows, with rows 1-6 being input with 1s to 2s, and rows 7-9 being repetition of output rows 1-3.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Rows 1-3: 020,220,020\n- Rows 7-9: 020,022,020 not matching.\n\nI am considering that it's a mistake in my logic. Let's finalize the rule as:\n- Transform input to output by changing 1s to 2s for all rows.\n- Output has number of rows = input rows + 3, with last 3 rows being a repetition of some middle rows, but since it's inconsistent, I'll assume for test input, output rows 7-9 are output rows 1-3 for simplicity, as it's a possible rule.\n\nI am considering the number of rows. Test input has 6 rows, so output should have 9 rows.\n\n**Test Input:**\n- Row 1: [1,1,1]\n- Row 2: [0,1,0]\n- Row 3: [0,1,0]\n- Row 4: [1,1,1]\n- Row 5: [0,1,0]\n- Row 6: [0,1,0]\n\nTransforming 1s to 2s:\n- Row 1: [2,2,2]\n- Row 2: [0,2,0]\n- Row 3: [0,2,0]\n- Row 4: [2,2,2]\n- Row 5: [0,2,0]\n- Row 6: [0,2,0]\n\nFor rows 7-9, I will take output rows 1-3 as repetition (as a guess based on partial matching in examples):\n- Row 7: [2,2,2]\n- Row 8: [0,2,0]\n- Row 9: [0,2,0]\n\nI will go with this as my final answer, acknowledging that the repetition rule was not perfectly consistent across examples, but this seems plausible.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[\n  [2, 2, 2],\n  [0, 2, 0],\n  [0, 2, 0],\n  [2, 2, 2],\n  [0, 2, 0],\n  [0, 2, 0],\n  [2, 2, 2],\n  [0, 2, 0],\n  [0, 2, 0]\n]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens": 3568, "model_answer": [[2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0], [2, 2, 2], [0, 2, 0], [0, 2, 0]], "correct": true, "total_tokens": 3944}
{"task_id": "08ed6ac7", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "x-ai/grok-3-beta", "raw_response": "<thinking>\nI am tasked with solving an ARC problem where I need to deduce a transformation rule from the given input-output pairs and apply it to a test input grid. Let's analyze the examples step by step to identify the pattern.\n\nFirst, I observe the input and output grids for Example 1. The input grid is a 9x9 grid, and so is the output. The input contains values like 0 and 5, while the output has values like 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. This suggests that the colors or values are being transformed in some way. Let me write down the input and output for clarity.\n\nExample 1 Input (as a grid):\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n```\n\nExample 1 Output:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 2 0 3 0 1 0 0 0\n0 2 0 3 0 1 0 0 0\n0 2 0 3 0 1 0 0 0\n0 2 0 3 0 1 0 4 0\n0 2 0 3 0 1 0 4 0\n0 2 0 3 0 1 0 4 0\n```\n\nI notice that wherever there is a 5 in the input, it seems to be replaced by different numbers in the output. Specifically:\n- The rightmost column of 5s in the input (column 5) becomes 1 in the output.\n- The left column of 5s (column 1) becomes 2 in the output.\n- The middle column of 5s (column 3) becomes 3 in the output.\n- The bottom row of 5s in the last column (column 7) becomes 4 in the output.\n\nThis suggests that the value in the output depends on the position of the 5 in the input grid, possibly based on which \"group\" or \"cluster\" of 5s it belongs to, or based on the column index.\n\nLet me check Example 2 to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n```\n\nExample 2 Output:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 3 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 3 0 1 0\n0 4 0 2 0 3 0 1 0\n0 4 0 2 0 3 0 1 0\n```\n\nAgain, the 5s in the input are transformed to different numbers in the output:\n- The rightmost column of 5s (column 7) becomes 1.\n- The column of 5s in column 4 becomes 2.\n- The column of 5s in column 6 becomes 3.\n- The leftmost column of 5s (column 1) becomes 4.\n\nIn both examples, the output value seems to be related to the column index of the 5s, but the mapping is not direct (e.g., column 7 maps to 1, not 7). Perhaps it's based on the order of columns containing 5s from right to left or left to right.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Column 5 (6th column, 0-based index 5) -> 1\n- Column 1 (2nd column, index 1) -> 2\n- Column 3 (4th column, index 3) -> 3\n- Column 7 (8th column, index 7) -> 4\n\nIf I sort the columns with 5s by their index: 1,3,5,7 map to 2,3,1,4. This doesn't seem consistent.\n\nI am considering the order of columns with 5s from right to left:\n- Rightmost column with 5s is column 7 -> maps to 4 in Example 1\n- Next is column 5 -> maps to 1\n- Next is column 3 -> maps to 3\n- Leftmost is column 1 -> maps to 2\n\nThis is not consistent. Let me try left to right:\n- Leftmost column with 5s is column 1 -> maps to 2\n- Next is column 3 -> maps to 3\n- Next is column 5 -> maps to 1\n- Next is column 7 -> maps to 4\n\nStill no clear pattern.\n\nI am considering that each separate vertical line of 5s gets a unique number, and the numbers are assigned based on some rule. In Example 1, there are 4 columns with 5s, and output values are 1,2,3,4. In Example 2, there are also 4 columns with 5s, and output values are 1,2,3,4.\n\nHypothesis: Each column containing at least one 5 in the input is assigned a unique number from 1 to n, where n is the number of such columns, and all 5s in that column are replaced with that number in the output.\n\nBut in Example 1, column 5 -> 1, column 1 -> 2, column 3 -> 3, column 7 -> 4. The assignment doesn't match the column order directly.\n\nI am considering the order of columns from left to right:\n- Example 1 columns with 5s: 1,3,5,7 map to 2,3,1,4\n- Example 2 columns with 5s: 1,4,6,7 map to 4,2,3,1\n\nStill no clear mapping. Perhaps it's based on the number of 5s in each column or something else.\n\nI am considering that the numbers 1,2,3,4 are assigned arbitrarily as long as each column of 5s gets a unique number. But ARC problems usually have a deterministic rule.\n\nI am considering the columns with 5s and assigning numbers based on their order, but I can't see a consistent mapping yet.\n\nI am considering the bounding box or the structure. Notice that in both examples, the 5s form vertical lines, and in the output, each vertical line of 5s is replaced by a vertical line of the same number.\n\nSo, rule so far: Identify all columns that contain at least one 5. Assign each such column a unique number (from 1 to the number of such columns), and replace all 5s in that column with the assigned number.\n\nNow, how are the numbers assigned to columns? Let's try ordering the columns by their index (left to right):\n- Example 1: columns 1,3,5,7 should map to 1,2,3,4 if left to right, but they map to 2,3,1,4. Not matching.\n- If right to left: column 7->1, 5->2, 3->3, 1->4, but output is 4,1,3,2. Not matching.\n\nI am considering that I miscounted. In Example 1:\n- Column 1 -> 2\n- Column 3 -> 3\n- Column 5 -> 1\n- Column 7 -> 4\n\nPerhaps it's based on the first row or something. I am considering that I need to find a different pattern.\n\nI am considering that the numbers are assigned based on the order of appearance if I read the grid in some way, but that seems complicated.\n\nI am considering that in ARC, often the rule is simple. Maybe I overcomplicate. Let me assume that the numbers are assigned from 1 to n for n columns with 5s, in left-to-right order.\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Columns with 5s: 1,4,6,7\n- Output values: column 1->4, column 4->2, column 6->3, column 7->1\n\nThis suggests right-to-left order:\n- Column 7 (rightmost with 5s) -> 1\n- Column 6 -> 3 (but should be 2 if strictly right to left)\n- Column 4 -> 2 (should be 3)\n- Column 1 -> 4 (matches leftmost as highest)\n\nIt's not strictly right to left. I am considering that I made a mistake in reading.\n\nIn Example 2 output, column 7 is 1, column 6 is 3, column 4 is 2, column 1 is 4.\n\nIf right to left:\n- Column 7 -> 1 (first from right)\n- Column 6 -> 3 (but should be 2)\nThis is inconsistent.\n\nI am considering that the assignment might be arbitrary, but that can't be, as ARC rules are deterministic.\n\nI am considering that I need to count the number of 5s in each column to determine the order.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Column 1: 9 5s -> maps to 2\n- Column 3: 6 5s -> maps to 3\n- Column 5: 9 5s -> maps to 1\n- Column 7: 3 5s -> maps to 4\n\nNo clear pattern (e.g., most 5s to least doesn't match).\n\nI am considering that it might be based on the topmost 5 in each column or something else.\n\nI am considering that the rule might be: assign numbers 1 to n to the columns with 5s in the order they appear from left to right.\n\nBut in Example 1, left to right columns 1,3,5,7 map to 2,3,1,4. Not 1,2,3,4.\n\nI am considering that I have the wrong approach. Let me double-check the output grid for Example 1. Maybe I misread the mapping.\n\nIn Example 1 output, column 1 (index 1) has value 2, column 3 has 3, column 5 has 1, column 7 has 4.\n\nI am considering that the value might be based on something else. Let's try to see the pattern differently.\n\nI am considering that the value assigned to each column of 5s might be based on the column index modulo something or a fixed mapping, but that seems unlikely.\n\nI am considering that in ARC, often the rule is to assign distinct colors to distinct objects. Here, each vertical line of 5s is a distinct \"object\", so each gets a unique number from 1 to n, where n is the number of such lines.\n\nSince the specific numbers might not matter as long as they are unique per column, but in ARC, the rule must be deterministic, I think the simplest rule is to assign numbers 1 to n from left to right for columns containing 5s.\n\nBut earlier checks show inconsistency. Let me recheck Example 2 output:\nColumns with 5s: 1,4,6,7\nValues in output: 4,2,3,1 respectively.\n\nSo:\n- Column 1 -> 4\n- Column 4 -> 2\n- Column 6 -> 3\n- Column 7 -> 1\n\nIf I number the columns with 5s from right to left:\n- Column 7 (rightmost) -> 1st -> value 1 (matches)\n- Column 6 -> 2nd -> value 2 (but it's 3, doesn't match)\nIn Example 2, column 6 has value 3, not 2.\n\nI am considering that I need to accept that my initial hypothesis is wrong. Let me try a different approach.\n\nI am considering that the value might be based on the row or something else. But looking at the output, it's consistent within columns.\n\nI am considering that I miscounted the columns. Let me write the column indices correctly.\n\nIn Example 2 input, columns with 5s are:\n- Column 1 (index 0 or 1 depending on 0-based or 1-based)\nUsing 1-based index for clarity (columns 1 to 9):\n- Columns with 5s: 2,5,7,8 (looking at input string, positions)\n\nInput row \"050505050\" means columns 2,4,6,8 have 5s in some rows, let me correct:\n\nExample 2 input last row: 050505050 means 5s in columns 2,4,6,8.\nBut looking at full grid:\nRow 1: all 0\nRow 2: 5 in column 8\nSo columns with 5s are: 2,5,7,8 (since row 5 has 5 in column 5, row 6 has 5 in 2,5,7,8, etc.)\n\nIn Example 2 input:\n- Column 2: has 5s (from row 8 down)\n- Column 5: has 5s (from row 5 down)\n- Column 7: has 5s (from row 6 down)\n- Column 8: has 5s (from row 2 down)\n\nSo columns with 5s: 2,5,7,8\n\nIn output:\n- Column 2: value 4\n- Column 5: value 2\n- Column 7: value 3\n- Column 8: value 1\n\nNow, order columns by their index (left to right): 2,5,7,8 map to values 4,2,3,1\n\nIf right to left: 8,7,5,2 map to 1,3,2,4\nSo, position 1 (rightmost, column 8) -> value 1\nPosition 2 (column 7) -> value 3 (should be 2 if sequential)\nStill inconsistent.\n\nI am considering the order of first appearance of 5 in each column from top to bottom.\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Column 8: first 5 at row 2\n- Column 5: first 5 at row 5\n- Column 7: first 5 at row 6\n- Column 2: first 5 at row 8\n\nSo order of first appearance (earliest row first):\n- Column 8 (row 2) -> should be value 1\n- Column 5 (row 5) -> value 2\n- Column 7 (row 6) -> value 3\n- Column 2 (row 8) -> value 4\n\nIn output:\n- Column 8: value 1 (matches first appearance order)\n- Column 5: value 2 (matches)\n- Column 7: value 3 (matches)\n- Column 2: value 4 (matches)\n\nThis matches perfectly!\n\nNow check Example 1:\nColumns with 5s: 2,4,6,8\nFirst appearance:\n- Column 6: first 5 at row 1\n- Column 2: first 5 at row 2\n- Column 4: first 5 at row 4\n- Column 8: first 5 at row 7\n\nOrder by first appearance (earliest row):\n- Column 6 -> should be value 1\n- Column 2 -> value 2\n- Column 4 -> value 3\n- Column 8 -> value 4\n\nIn Example 1 output:\n- Column 6: value 1 (matches)\n- Column 2: value 2 (matches)\n- Column 4: value 3 (matches)\n- Column 8: value 4 (matches)\n\nPerfect! The rule is:\n- Identify all columns that contain at least one 5.\n- Sort these columns by the row index of the first (topmost) 5 in each column (smallest row index first).\n- Assign values 1 to n in this order, where n is the number of such columns.\n- Replace all 5s in each column with the assigned value for that column.\n\nNow, apply this to the Test Input:\nTest Input grid (9x9):\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 5 0 5 0\n0 5 0 0 0 5 0 5 0\n0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n0 5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n```\n\nColumns with 5s:\n- Column 2: first 5 at row 2\n- Column 6: first 5 at row 3\n- Column 4: first 5 at row 7\n- Column 8: first 5 at row 5\n\nOrder by first appearance (row index):\n- Column 2 (row 2) -> value 1\n- Column 6 (row 3) -> value 2\n- Column 8 (row 5) -> value 3\n- Column 4 (row 7) -> value 4\n\nNow, construct the output grid by replacing 5s with the assigned values:\n- Column 2: replace 5s with 1\n- Column 4: replace 5s with 4\n- Column 6: replace 5s with 2\n- Column 8: replace 5s with 3\n- Other columns remain 0\n\nSo, output grid:\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 3 0\nRow 6: 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 3 0\nRow 7: 0 1 0 4 0 2 0 3 0\nRow 8: 0 1 0 4 0 2 0 3 0\nRow 9: 0 1 0 4 0 2 0 3 0\n\nI will double-check the column assignments and row indices to ensure correctness.\nColumns with 5s:\n- Column 2: 5s start at row 2\n- Column 6: 5s start at row 3\n- Column 8: 5s start at row 5\n- Column 4: 5s start at row 7\nOrder is correct: 2,6,8,4 map to 1,2,3,4.\n\nValues:\n- All 5s in column 2 become 1\n- All 5s in column 6 become 2\n- All 5s in column 8 become 3\n- All 5s in column 4 become 4\n\nGrid looks correct based on input.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[\n  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0],\n  [0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0]\n]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 444, "completion_tokens": 4844, "model_answer": [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0], [0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0], [0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0], [0, 1, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0]], "correct": true, "total_tokens": 5288}
{"task_id": "0520fde7", "test_case_index": 0, "api_provider": "openrouter", "teacher_model": "x-ai/grok-3-beta", "raw_response": "<thinking>\nI begin by analyzing the provided input and output grids for the three examples to identify the transformation rule. Then, I will apply this rule to the test input grid to predict the output.\n\nFirst, I interpret the grids from the string format. Each string represents a row of the grid, and each digit is a cell value.\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input (3x7 grid):\n  ```\n  1 0 0 5 0 1 0\n  0 1 0 5 1 1 1\n  1 0 0 5 0 0 0\n  ```\n- Output (3x3 grid):\n  ```\n  0 0 0\n  0 2 0\n  0 0 0\n  ```\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input (3x7 grid):\n  ```\n  1 1 0 5 0 1 0\n  0 0 1 5 1 1 1\n  1 1 0 5 0 1 0\n  ```\n- Output (3x3 grid):\n  ```\n  0 2 0\n  0 0 2\n  0 2 0\n  ```\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input (3x7 grid):\n  ```\n  0 0 1 5 0 0 0\n  1 1 0 5 1 0 1\n  0 1 1 5 1 0 1\n  ```\n- Output (3x3 grid):\n  ```\n  0 0 0\n  2 0 0\n  0 0 2\n  ```\n\n**Test Input (3x7 grid):**\n```\n1 0 1 5 1 0 1\n0 1 0 5 1 0 1\n1 0 1 5 0 1 0\n```\n\nI notice that all input grids are 3x7, and all output grids are 3x3. The output grid is smaller, suggesting a reduction or summarization of the input data. I also observe that the output grids primarily contain the values 0 and 2, while the input grids have various values like 0, 1, 5, etc. The value 5 appears consistently in the fourth column of every input grid, which may serve as a reference point.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the role of value 5**\nSince 5 appears in every row of the input grids at column index 3 (fourth column), it might be a marker or separator. I split the input grid into two parts: columns 0-2 (left of 5) and columns 4-6 (right of 5).\n\nFor Example 1:\n- Left part (columns 0-2):\n  ```\n  1 0 0\n  0 1 0\n  1 0 0\n  ```\n- Right part (columns 4-6):\n  ```\n  0 1 0\n  1 1 1\n  0 0 0\n  ```\n\nIn the output grid, there is a 2 at position (1,1), which is the center of the 3x3 grid. This might correspond to a specific pattern in the left or right part.\n\n**Step 2: Look for patterns in 2's in output**\nIn the output grids:\n- Example 1: 2 at (1,1)\n- Example 2: 2 at (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)\n- Example 3: 2 at (1,0), (2,2)\n\nThe positions of 2's vary, and there isn't a direct correspondence to a single value or position in the input grid. I consider if the 2's represent the presence of 1's in specific regions of the input grid mapped to the output grid.\n\n**Step 3: Mapping input to output**\nSince the input is 3x7 and output is 3x3, the input columns might be grouped or mapped to output columns. If I consider the input divided by the 5 marker:\n- Left part (3x3, columns 0-2)\n- Right part (3x3, columns 4-6)\n\nBut the output is also 3x3, so I hypothesize that the output represents a combination or comparison of the left and right parts.\n\n**Step 4: Hypothesize a rule based on 1's positions**\nI count the number of 1's in the left and right parts for each row:\n- Example 1:\n  - Left: Row 0: 1, Row 1: 1, Row 2: 1 (total 3)\n  - Right: Row 0: 1, Row 1: 3, Row 2: 0 (total 4)\n  - Output has one 2 at (1,1), which doesn't directly match counts.\n- Example 2:\n  - Left: Row 0: 2, Row 1: 1, Row 2: 2 (total 5)\n  - Right: Row 0: 1, Row 1: 3, Row 2: 1 (total 5)\n  - Output has three 2's, still unclear.\n\nThe number of 2's doesn't match the counts directly. I consider if it's about positions of 1's. After examining the output positions of 2's, I notice they might correspond to positions where 1's appear in the input, but adjusted to the 3x3 grid.\n\n**Step 5: Test a positional mapping**\nI map the input's left part (columns 0-2) and right part (columns 4-6) to the output grid, checking if 2's appear where there is a 1 in the corresponding position:\n- In Example 1, left part has 1's at (0,0), (1,1), (2,0)\n- Right part has 1's at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\n- Output has 2 at (1,1), which is a position with 1 in both left and right parts.\n\nChecking further:\n- In Example 1, position (1,1) has 1 in both left and right, and output has 2 there.\n- In Example 2:\n  - Left part 1's: (0,0), (0,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1)\n  - Right part 1's: (0,1), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)\n  - Common positions with 1's: (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)\n  - Output has 2's exactly at (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). Perfect match!\n- In Example 3:\n  - Left part 1's: (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)\n  - Right part 1's: (1,0), (1,2), (2,0), (2,2)\n  - Common positions: (1,0), (2,2)\n  - Output has 2's at (1,0), (2,2). Perfect match!\n\n**Step 6: Formulate the rule**\nThe transformation rule is: The output grid is 3x3, and a cell has value 2 if the corresponding position in both the left part (columns 0-2) and right part (columns 4-6) of the input grid has value 1. Otherwise, the output cell is 0.\n\n**Step 7: Apply the rule to the test input**\nTest Input (3x7):\n```\n1 0 1 5 1 0 1\n0 1 0 5 1 0 1\n1 0 1 5 0 1 0\n```\n- Left part (columns 0-2):\n  ```\n  1 0 1\n  0 1 0\n  1 0 1\n  ```\n- Right part (columns 4-6):\n  ```\n  1 0 1\n  1 0 1\n  0 1 0\n  ```\n- Find positions where both parts have 1:\n  - (0,0): Left=1, Right=1 \u2192 2\n  - (0,1): Left=0, Right=0 \u2192 0\n  - (0,2): Left=1, Right=1 \u2192 2\n  - (1,0): Left=0, Right=1 \u2192 0\n  - (1,1): Left=1, Right=0 \u2192 0\n  - (1,2): Left=0, Right=1 \u2192 0\n  - (2,0): Left=1, Right=0 \u2192 0\n  - (2,1): Left=0, Right=1 \u2192 0\n  - (2,2): Left=1, Right=0 \u2192 0\n\nSo, the output grid should be:\n```\n2 0 2\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\n**Step 8: Consistency check**\nI double-checked the positions:\n- At (0,0), both left and right have 1, so 2 is correct.\n- At (0,2), both have 1, so 2 is correct.\n- All other positions have at least one 0 in left or right, so output is 0.\n\nThe rule holds for all example grids and is consistently applied to the test input.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>\n[[2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens": 2134, "model_answer": [[2, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]], "correct": true, "total_tokens": 2474}

In both examples, the grids consist of 0's and 5's, and the outputs replace the 5's with numbers like 1, 2, 3, and 4, while keeping 0's unchanged.\n\nFrom Example 1, I observed that 5's are replaced based on connected components. Specifically, 5's that are connected (via 4-way adjacency: up, down, left, right) form groups, and each unique group is assigned a number. The numbers are assigned sequentially (starting from 1) based on the order in which the first cell of each component is encountered when scanning the grid row by row, from left to right.\n\nFor instance, in Example 1:\n- The first 5 (row 1, column 6) starts a new component, assigned 1.\n- In row 2, the 5 at column 2 starts a new component, assigned 2.\n- Later 5's are assigned based on whether they belong to an existing component.\n\nIn Example 2, the same pattern holds:\n- The first 5 (row 2, column 8) is assigned 1.\n- Subsequent 5's are assigned numbers (2, 3, 4) for new components as they are first encountered.\n\nThis confirms the rule: Identify 4-way connected components of 5's, assign each new component a sequential number when its first cell is encountered in row-major order, and replace all 5's in that component with that number. Non-5 cells remain 0.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n- Scan the grid row by row.\n- For the test input:\n  - Row 2, Column 2 (5): New component, assign 1.

When we break the output into nine 3\u00d73 blocks (arranged as three rows and three columns of blocks), we see that each block is determined by the corresponding cell in the input grid. In particular, if the cell in the input is nonzero then the corresponding block is a copy of the entire input grid; if the cell is 0 then the block is a 3\u00d73 block of zeros.\n\nFor example, in Example 2 the input grid is:\n\u2003Row0: 4 0 4\n\u2003Row1: 0 0 0\n\u2003Row2: 0 4 0\nLooking at the input cells:\n\u2022\u2003Cell (0,0) is 4 (nonzero) so the block at position (0,0) becomes the input grid.\n\u2022\u2003Cell (0,1) is 0 so the block (0,1) is all zeros.\n\u2022\u2003Cell (0,2) is 4 so block (0,2) is the input grid.\nAnd similarly for the other rows. Checking all examples confirms this rule.\n\nNow, for the test input the grid is:\n\u2003Row0: 7 0 7\n\u2003Row1: 7 0 7\n\u2003Row2: 7 7 0\n\nWe form a 3\u00d73 arrangement of 3\u00d73 blocks as follows:\n\u2022\u2003Block (0,0) corresponds to input cell (0,0)=7 (nonzero) \u2192 use the entire input grid.\n\u2022\u2003Block (0,1) corresponds to input cell (0,1)=0 \u2192 fill with zeros.\n\u2022\u2003Block (0,2) corresponds to input cell (0,2)=7 \u2192 use the input grid.\n\u2022\u2003Block (1,0) corresponds to input cell (1,0)=7 \u2192 input grid.\n\u2022\u2003Block (1,1) corresponds to input cell (1,1)=0 \u2192 zeros.\n\u2022\u2003Block (1,2) corresponds to input cell (1,2)=7 \u2192 input grid.\n\u2022\u2003Block (2,0) corresponds to input cell (2,0)=7 \u2192 input grid.\n\u2022\u2003Block (2,1) corresponds to input cell (2,1)=7 \u2192 input grid.\n\u2022\u2003Block (2,2) corresponds to input cell (2,2)=0 \u2192 zeros.\n\nThe input grid (which we\u2019ll denote as I) is:\n\u2003I row0: \"707\"\n\u2003I row1: \"707\"\n\u2003I row2: \"770\"\nSo when we \u201ctile\u201d the output, each block that is I is exactly the 3 rows: [\"707\", \"707\", \"770\"], while a zero block is [\"000\", \"000\", \"000\"].\n\nNow we construct the 9\u00d79 output row\u2010by\u2010row.\n\nBlock row 0 (i.e. output rows 0\u20132) contains blocks:\n\u2003(0,0): I\u2003, (0,1): 0\u2003, (0,2): I.\nThus:\n\u2022\u2003Output row 0 = I row0 + zero row + I row0 = \"707\" + \"000\" + \"707\" = \"707000707\"\n\u2022\u2003Output row 1 = I row1 + zero row + I row1 = \"707\" + \"000\" + \"707\" = \"707000707\"\n\u2022\u2003Output row 2 = I row2 + zero row + I row2 = \"770\" + \"000\" + \"770\" = \"770000770\"\n\nBlock row 1 (output rows 3\u20135) contains:\n\u2003(1,0): I\u2003, (1,1): 0\u2003, (1,2): I.\nThus:\n\u2022\u2003Output row 3 = \"707\" + \"000\" + \"707\" = \"707000707\"\n\u2022\u2003Output row 4 = \"707\" + \"000\" + \"707\" = \"707000707\"\n\u2022\u2003Output row 5 = \"770\" + \"000\" + \"770\" = \"770000770\"\n\nBlock row 2 (output rows 6\u20138) contains:\n\u2003(2,0): I\u2003, (2,1): I\u2003, (2,2): 0.\nThus:\n\u2022\u2003Output row 6 = \"707\" + \"707\" + \"000\" = \"707707000\"\n\u2022\u2003Output row 7 = \"707\" + \"707\" + \"000\" = \"707707000\"\n\u2022\u2003Output row 8 = \"770\" + \"770\" + \"000\" = \"770770000\"\n\nFinally, converting each row into a list of integers, we get:\n\nRow 0: [7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7]\nRow 1: [7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7]\nRow 2: [7,7,0,0,0,0,7,7,0]\nRow 3: [7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7]\nRow 4: [7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7]\nRow 5: [7,7,0,0,0,0,7,7,0]\nRow 6: [7,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0]\nRow 7: [7,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0]\nRow 8: [7,7,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]\n  \nThis is the final predicted output grid.\n</thinking>\n\n<answer>[[7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7],\n[7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7],\n[7,7,0,0,0,0,7,7,0],\n[7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7],\n[7,0,7,0,0,0,7,0,7],\n[7,7,0,0,0,0,7,7,0],\n[7,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0],\n[7,0,7,7,0,7,0,0,0],\n[7,7,0,7,7,0,0,0,0]]</answer>", "prompt_tokens": 515, "completion_tokens": 11143, "model_answer": [[7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 7], [7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [7, 7, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0]], "correct": true, "total_tokens": 11658}

For each nonzero (i,j) in input, the output contains the input at (3*i, 3*j).\n\nSo, the rule is:\n\n**For each nonzero cell (i, j) in the input, place a copy of the input grid at position (3*i, 3*j) in the output grid.
